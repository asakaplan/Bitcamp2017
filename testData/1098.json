Marvin L. Karp, ULMER & BERNE LLP, Cleveland, Ohio, for\nAppellees.\n                                    _________________\n\n                                         OPINION\n                                    _________________\n\n        COLE, Circuit Judge.       The plaintiff-appellant, Ultimate Appliance CC (“the\nplaintiff”), filed suit against the defendants-appellees, The Kirby Company and The Scott\nFetzer Company (“the defendants”), on January 4, 2007. The district court granted the\ndefendants’ motion to dismiss on September 30, 2008. Under Federal Rule of Appellate\nProcedure 4 (“Rule 4”), a notice of appeal must be filed “within 30 days after the judgment\nor order appealed from is entered,” but a party may move for a filing extension within thirty\ndays of the expiration of the initial time period. Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1)(A), (5)(A)(i). Here,\n\n\n\n                                              1\n\fNo. 09-3297         Ultimate Appliance v. The Kirby Co. et al.                           Page 2\n\n\nRule 4 required that the plaintiff file a notice of appeal by October 30, 2008 or a motion for\na filing extension by December 1, 2008. See Fed. R. App. P. 26(a)(1) (setting out method\nfor computing time periods). On December 2, the plaintiff filed a motion for extension of\ntime. The district court denied the motion, holding that it had no authority to grant a filing\nextension once the Rule 4 deadline had expired. The plaintiff now appeals.\n\n        According to the plaintiff, the district court erred in holding that the time periods set\nforth in Rule 4 are mandatory and jurisdictional. The plaintiff points to recent Supreme\nCourt decisions indicating that nonextendable time limits, such as those prescribed in Rule\n4, “however emphatic, are not properly typed jurisdictional.” Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546\nU.S. 500, 510 (2006) (internal quotation marks omitted); see Eberhart v. United States, 546\nU.S. 12, 15 (2005) (holding filing deadline for a motion for a new trial under Federal Rule\nof Criminal Procedure 33 is nonjurisdictional); Scarborough v. Principi, 541 U.S. 401, 413-\n14 (2004) (Equal Access to Justice Act fee application deadline nonjurisdictional); Kontrick\nv. Ryan, 540 U.S. 443, 454-55 (2004) (deadline for filing a complaint under Bankruptcy Rule\n4004 objecting to a debtor’s discharge nonjurisdictional).\n\n        As the defendants note, however, none of these decisions concerns Rule 4’s\ndeadlines, which the Supreme Court and this Court consistently have termed mandatory and\njurisdictional. See Budinich v. Becton Dickinson & Co., 486 U.S. 196, 203 (1988) (holding\nthat “the taking of an appeal within the prescribed time is mandatory and jurisdictional”);\nFeltner v. Lamar Adver. of Tenn., Inc., 200 F. App’x 419, 422 (6th Cir. 2006) (“Compliance\nwith Fed. R. App. P. 4(a) is a mandatory and jurisdictional prerequisite which this court can\nneither waive nor extend.”) (quoting Baker v. Raulie, 879 F.2d 1396, 1398 (6th Cir. 1989));\nIn re Sulzer Orthopedics & Knee Prosthesis Prods. Liab. Litig., 399 F.3d 816, 817 (6th Cir.\n2005) (quoting Browder v. Dep’t of Corr., 434 U.S. 257, 264 (1978) for the proposition that\nthe thirty-day limit in which to file an appeal is “mandatory and jurisdictional”). Most\nrecently, in Bowles v. Russell, 551 U.S. 205 (2007), affirming a decision by this Court, the\nSupreme Court held that “[the petitioner’s] failure to file his notice of appeal in accordance\nwith the statute . . . deprived the Court of Appeals of jurisdiction” and distinguished the\ncases on which the plaintiff seeks to rely. Id. at 210-13; see also Reed Elsevier, Inc. v.\nMuchnick, 559 U.S. --, No. 08-103, slip op. at 11-14 (U.S. Mar. 2, 2010) (discussing\n\fNo. 09-3297          Ultimate Appliance v. The Kirby Co. et al.                           Page 3\n\n\nBowles). In light of this precedent, the district court did not err in holding it lacked authority\nto grant the plaintiff’s untimely motion.\n\n        Alternatively, the plaintiff argues that, even if Rule 4’s time limits are mandatory and\njurisdictional, it was entitled to an extra three days to file a notice of appeal pursuant to\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 6(d) (“When a party may or must act within a specified time\nafter service and service is made [by a method other than handing it to the party or leaving\nit at his office or dwelling] 3 days are added after the period would otherwise expire . . . .”)\nand Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 26(c) (“When a party may or must act within a\nspecified time after service, 3 calendar days are added after the period would otherwise\nexpire . . . .”). The plaintiff reads these two provisions as pushing its deadline for filing a\nmotion for an extension to December 3, 2008―one day after the motion actually was filed.\n\n        As the plaintiff acknowledges, however, we repeatedly have held, as have other\ncircuit courts, that neither rule extends the time to file a notice of appeal, since the Rule 4\nclock starts when a judgment is entered, not when service of the judgment is effected. See,\ne.g., Rhoden v. Wyatt, No. 92-6017, 1992 WL 340953, at *1 (6th Cir. Nov. 23, 1992); Price\nv. Morris, No. 87-3432, 1987 WL 44844, at *1 (6th Cir. Sept. 22, 1987); Johnson v. Green,\nNo. 86-6165, 1986 WL 18578, at *1 (6th Cir. Dec. 8, 1986); see also Ludgood v. Apex\nMarine Corp. Ship Mgmt., 311 F.3d 364, 367 (5th Cir. 2000); Mattson v. Brown Univ., 925\nF.2d 529, 532 (1st Cir. 1991); Sofarelli Assocs., Inc. v. United States, 716 F.2d 1395, 1396\n(Fed. Cir. 1983); Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc. v. Kurtenbach, 525 F.2d 1179,\n1181 (8th Cir. 1975). The plaintiff nonetheless contends that all this precedent is in error\nbecause the courts have failed to consider Rule 4 in conjunction with Rule 77 of the Federal\nRules of Civil Procedure, which requires service of notice of the entry of judgment. That\nservice of notice is mandatory, however, has no bearing on when the Rule 4 clock starts and\nruns out. Indeed, Rule 77 itself indicates that it has no impact on Rule 4’s filing deadlines.\nSee Fed. R. Civ. P. 77(d)(2) (“Lack of notice of the entry [of judgment] does not affect the\ntime for appeal or relieve―or authorize the court to relieve―a party for failing to appeal\nwithin the time allowed, except as allowed by Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure (4)(a).”).\n\n        The district court found that the plaintiff’s former counsel wholly abdicated her\nprofessional obligations by failing to notify the plaintiff that its suit had been dismissed,\n\fNo. 09-3297          Ultimate Appliance v. The Kirby Co. et al.                            Page 4\n\n\ndespite having received electronic notice and a telephone call from the court regarding the\ndismissal. Although we are sympathetic to the plaintiff’s plight, we are not free to ignore\nRule 4’s restrictions. See Bowles, 551 U.S. at 214 (“[T]he timely filing of a notice of appeal\nin a civil case is a jurisdictional requirement. . . . [T]his Court has no authority to create\nequitable exceptions to jurisdictional requirements . . . .”). If the plaintiff is to seek redress,\nit must do so against its former counsel.\n\n        For all of the reasons set forth above, we AFFIRM the district court’s order denying\nthe plaintiff’s motion for an extension of time to appeal.\n\f",

In light of this precedent, the district court did not err in holding it lacked authority to grant the plaintiff's untimely motion.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, the plaintiff argues that, even if Rule 4's time limits are mandatory and jurisdictional, it was entitled to an extra three days to file a notice of appeal pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 6(d) (\"When a party may or must act within a specified time after service and service is made [by a method other than handing it to the party or leaving it at his office or dwelling] 3 days are added after the period would otherwise expire. . . .\") and Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 26(c) (\"When a party may or must act within a specified time after service, 3 calendar days are added after the period would otherwise expire. . . .\"). The plaintiff reads these two provisions as pushing its deadline for filing a motion for an extension to December 3, 2008  one day after the motion actually was filed.</p>\n<p>As the plaintiff acknowledges, however, we repeatedly have held, as have other circuit courts, that neither rule extends the time to file a notice of appeal, since the Rule 4 clock starts when a judgment is entered, not when service of the judgment is effected. <i>See, e.g., Rhoden v.

The plaintiff nonetheless contends that all this precedent is in error because the courts have failed to consider Rule 4 in conjunction with Rule 77 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which requires service of notice of the entry of judgment. That service of notice is mandatory, however, has no bearing on when the Rule 4 clock starts and runs out. Indeed, Rule 77 itself indicates that it has no impact on Rule 4's filing deadlines. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 77(d)(2) (\"Lack of notice of the entry [of judgment] does not affect the time for appeal or relieve  or authorize the court to relieve  a party for failing to appeal within the time allowed, except as allowed by Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure (4)(a).\").</p>\n<p>The district court found that the plaintiff's former counsel wholly abdicated her professional obligations by failing to notify the plaintiff that its suit had been dismissed, despite having received electronic notice and a telephone call from the court regarding the dismissal. Although we are sympathetic to the plaintiff's plight, we are not free to ignore Rule 4's restrictions. <i>See </i><i>Bowles,</i> 551 U.S. at 214, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145714\"><a href=\"/opinion/145714/bowles-v-russell/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2360</span></a></span> (\"[T]he timely filing of a notice of appeal in a civil case is a jurisdictional requirement. . . . [T]his Court has no authority to create equitable exceptions to jurisdictional requirements. . . .\"). If the plaintiff is to seek redress, it must do so against its former counsel.</p>\n<p>For all of the reasons set forth above, we AFFIRM the district court's order denying the plaintiff's motion for an extension of time to appeal.</p>\n</div>",
