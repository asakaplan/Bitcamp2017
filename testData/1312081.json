On December 3, 2009, Biros filed a motion to amend his complaint to challenge the new, November 30, 2009 protocol. On December 4, the district court granted the motion and ordered an evidentiary hearing to commence 4 1/2 hours later. In my view, basic procedural due process demands more. On this issue, the final page of Judge Frost's opinion is revealing: \"It is not clear whether Biros could discover and present facts evincing a viable claim that would enable him to prevail in this litigation so that Ohio would need to find another method by which to execute him.\" I would GRANT the petition for rehearing en banc and STAY the execution.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Judge Cook recused herself from participation in this ruling.</p>\n\n</div>",
