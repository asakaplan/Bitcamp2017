The Sullivans allege that Mathews Ford breached its duty to exercise ordinary care in maintaining the premises in a reasonably safe condition. Mathews Ford moved for and the district court granted summary judgment because the Sullivans failed to show that Mathews Ford was responsible for the alleged hazard and failed to produce evidence that the hazard existed for a sufficient length of time to provide constructive notice. <i>See </i><i>Sullivan v. Oregon Ford, Inc.,</i> 552 F.Supp.2d 681 (N.D.Ohio 2008).</p>\n<p>This Court reviews a grant of summary judgment de novo. <i>Barrett v. Whirlpool Corp.,</i> 556 F.3d 502, 511 (6th Cir.2009) (citing <i>Miller v. Admin. Office of the Courts,</i> 448 F.3d 887, 893 (6th Cir.2006)). The moving party is entitled to summary judgment \"if the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); <i>see also </i><i>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc.,</i> 477 U.S. 242, 247, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). We view factual evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and draw all reasonable inferences in that party's favor. <i>See </i><i>Henderson v. Walled Lake Consol. Sch.,</i> 469 F.3d 479, 487 (6th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p>We have carefully reviewed the parties' briefs, the applicable law, and the district court's order granting summary judgment to Mathews Ford. We agree that no genuine issues of material fact exist and that defendants are entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Because the district court's decision is well-reasoned, we need not expand on its analysis. Therefore, we AFFIRM the grant of summary judgment to Mathews Ford for the reasons stated in the district court's opinion.</p>\n</div>",
