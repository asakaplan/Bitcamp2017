By remaining loyal to the errant obiter dictum contained in <i>Thornton v.

Contrary to the federal regulations and the weight of authority, a panel of this court in <i>Moses</i> held that federal law imposes a duty on hospitals that accept Medicare funding to adequately stabilize a patient after the hospital has satisfied its emergency room obligations by either transferring the individual or admitting him for in-patient care. Our panel decision misconstrues EMTALA, making it a general federal medical malpractice statute, rather than an act limited to emergency room screening and stabilization. <i>Bryan,</i> 95 F.3d at 351.</p>\n<p>For these reasons, I would grant rehearing en banc and therefore respectfully dissent.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  The Honorable Frederick P.
