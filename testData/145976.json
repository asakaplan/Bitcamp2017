Plaintiff-Appellant Jerry Flanory (“Flanory”), a\nprisoner proceeding pro se, appeals the decision of the district court to dismiss his\nComplaint for failure to state a claim against Defendants-Appellees Allen Bonn\n(“Bonn”), Robert Torp (“Torp”), Jeffrey Woods (“Woods”), Linda Tribley (“Tribley”),\nAlma Potts (“Potts”), Nancy Marshall (“Marshall”), Barry Davis (“Davis”), and Jim\nArmstrong (“Armstrong”) (collectively, the “Defendants”). For the following reasons,\nwe REVERSE the judgment of the district court and REMAND the case.\n\n                                 I. BACKGROUND\n\n       Flanory is currently incarcerated at the Mound Correctional Facility, but his\nclaims pertain to events that took place while he was housed at the Newberry\nCorrectional Facility (“NCF”).      On or about December 12, 2004, Flanory was\ninterviewed by Bonn, the Classification Director at NCF, for placement in the General\nEquivalent Degree (“GED”) program at the facility. Flanory informed both Bonn and\nTorp, the principal of NCF’s GED program, that he had obtained his GED from the\nSarvis Educational Center many years before, and that he had since obtained an\nAssociate Degree in General Studies from the Montcalm Community College. Flanory\nfurther advised that verification of his educational history could be found in his\nPresentence Investigation Report (“PSIR”). Torp informed Flanory that NCF policy\nprohibits the use of the PSIR for verification of educational history. Linda Tribley, the\nAssistant Deputy Warden at NCF, advised Flanory that it was his responsibility to\nprovide documentation showing his educational achievements. Notwithstanding the fact\n\fNo. 09-1161         Flanory v. Bonn, et al.                                       Page 3\n\n\nthat he already had his GED, and over his objections, Flanory was assigned to the GED\nprogram. Because he already had obtained his GED, Flanory refused to attend the class.\n\n         On January 4, 2005, Flanory filed a grievance on the issues of his GED,\nAssociate Degree, and PSIR, contesting the requirement that he participate in a GED\nclass, which he had already completed, for a degree he had already obtained. On\nJanuary 5, 2005, Flanory signed an Assignment Waiver Form to be removed from the\nGED program and the school roster. On January 28, 2005, Bonn placed Flanory on\nroom restriction for waiving the GED program. Room restriction disqualified Flanory\nfrom indigent status. As a result, he was not able to purchase personal hygiene items,\nincluding toothpaste. In response to Flanory’s grievance concerning the situation, Davis,\nNCF Warden, denied Flanory’s grievance appeal, stating that Flanory would be\nineligible for indigent status for a period of 12 months, and that certain hygiene items,\nincluding bars of soap, shampoo, tooth swabs, and toilet paper, were available in the\nhousing units. Flanory then requested these items from Potts, NCF Assistant Resident\nUnit Supervisor, who responded that the items were not available. Toothpaste was\namong the hygiene items listed by Davis as only available for purchase in the prisoner\nstore.\n\n         In October 2005, Flanory met with the new principal of NCF’s GED program,\nMr. Belles, who then contacted Montcalm Community College and verified Flanory’s\nAssociate Degree. On November 10, 2005, Flanory was removed from room restriction\nand added to the work pool. After securing funds from his job assignment, Flanory\nrequested his records from the Sarvis Educational Center. On April 18, 2006, Flanory\nreceived documentation showing that he had earned a GED.\n\n         Flanory’s placement on room restriction and his loss of indigent status caused\nhim to be without toothpaste beginning in January 2005, for a period of 337 days.\nFlanory had undergone a dental examination in October 2004, which revealed no dental\nproblems. In September 2005, Flanory experienced a toothache. After an examination,\nFlanory was diagnosed with peridontal disease of the gums, and one tooth was extracted.\n\fNo. 09-1161        Flanory v. Bonn, et al.                                        Page 4\n\n\n       On May 1, 2008, Flanory initiated this action, which sought compensatory and\npunitive damages, alleging that his dental health declined because he was wrongfully\nplaced on room restriction and denied indigent status, and he was not otherwise provided\nwith dental hygiene supplies. Flanory claimed that Defendants violated the Privacy Act,\n5 U.S.C. §§ 552a(e)(5), (g)(1)(c) and (g)(4), by failing to verify his educational\ncredentials, which caused Defendants to place him on room restriction and deny him\nindigent status for approximately nine months. He further alleged that Defendants\nviolated his Eighth Amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment by\ndenying his access to dental hygiene supplies, including toothpaste, which led to his gum\ndisease.\n\n       On August 27, 2008, Magistrate Judge Greeley issued a Report and\nRecommendation that Flanory’s Complaint be dismissed for failure to state a claim. On\nSeptember 17, 2008, Flanory filed Objections to the Report and Recommendation. In\nhis objections, Flanory conceded his Privacy Act claim. On January 5, 2009, the district\ncourt issued an Order approving and adopting the Report and Recommendation. Flanory\nv. Bonn, No. 2:08-cv-108, 2009 WL 33472 (W.D. Mich. Jan. 5, 2009). Flanory then\ntimely filed this appeal.\n\n                                 II. JURISDICTION\n\n       Because Flanory has appealed from a final judgment that disposed of all of his\nclaims, we have jurisdiction based on 28 U.S.C. § 1291. This case has been referred to\na panel of the court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(1), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon\nexamination, this panel unanimously agreed that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.\nApp. P. 34(a).\n\n                            III. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n       The Prison Litigation Reform Act, Pub. L. No. 103-134, 110 Stat. 1321 (1996),\nrequires dismissal of any prisoner action brought under federal law if the complaint is\nfrivolous, malicious, fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, or seeks\nmonetary relief from a defendant immune from such relief. 28 U.S.C. §§ 1915(e),\n\fNo. 09-1161         Flanory v. Bonn, et al.                                          Page 5\n\n\n1915A; 42 U.S.C. § 1997e. We review de novo a district court’s dismissal of a\ncomplaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1915(e), 1915A, and 42 U.S.C. § 1997e. Grinter v.\nKnight, 532 F.3d 567, 571-72 (6th Cir. 2008). “A motion to dismiss for failure to state\na claim is a test of the plaintiff’s cause of action as stated in the complaint, not a\nchallenge to the plaintiff’s factual allegations.” Golden v. City of Columbus, 404 F.3d\n950, 958-59 (6th Cir. 2005). A complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief could\nbe granted when it is clear that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts consistent with the\nallegations that would entitle him to relief. Jones v. City of Carlisle, 3 F.3d 945, 947\n(6th Cir. 1993). A complaint that suggests “the mere possibility of misconduct” is\ninsufficient; rather, the complaint must state “a plausible claim for relief.” Ashcroft v.\nIqbal, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 1950 (2009) (citing Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S 544, 556\n(2007)). To state a claim for relief under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, a plaintiff must allege a\nviolation of a right secured by the federal Constitution or laws and must show that the\nviolation was committed by a person acting under color of state law. West v. Atkins, 487\nU.S. 42, 48 (1988); Street v. Corrs. Corp. of Am., 102 F.3d 810, 814 (6th Cir. 1996).\n\n                                     IV. ANALYSIS\n\n        Since Flanory conceded his Privacy Act claim earlier in the litigation, the only\nremaining claim is the alleged Eighth Amendment violation. The Eighth Amendment\nprohibits prison officials from “unnecessarily and wantonly inflicting pain” on prisoners\nby acting with “deliberate indifference” to prisoners’ serious medical needs. Blackmore\nv. Kalamazoo County, 390 F.3d 890, 895 (6th Cir. 2004) (quoting Estelle v. Gamble, 429\nU.S. 97, 104 (1976)). Failure to provide medical care may rise to the level of a violation\nof the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause of the Eighth Amendment where objective\nand subjective requirements are met. Harrison v. Ash, 539 F.3d 510, 517-18 (6th Cir.\n2008); Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 833 (1994).\n\n        To satisfy the objective component, the injury must be sufficiently serious.\nWilson v. Seiter, 501 U.S. 294, 297 (1991) (stating that Eighth Amendment is implicated\nby the “unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain” and not “inadvertent failure to\nprovide adequate medical care”); Estelle, 429 U.S. at 106 (“In order to state a cognizable\n\fNo. 09-1161         Flanory v. Bonn, et al.                                           Page 6\n\n\nclaim, a prisoner must allege acts or omissions sufficiently harmful to evidence\ndeliberate indifference to serious medical needs.”); Talal v. White, 403 F.3d 423, 426\n(6th Cir. 2005) (requiring that the prisoner demonstrate more than “mere discomfort or\ninconvenience”). In the context of “conditions of confinement” cases, the Eighth\nAmendment is concerned only with “deprivations of essential food, medical care or\nsanitation” or “other conditions intolerable for prison.” Rhodes v. Chapman, 452 U.S.\n337, 347 (1981); see also Brown v. Bargery, 207 F.3d 863, 867 (6th Cir. 2000) (citing\nFarmer, 511 U.S. at 834) (“[T]he inmate must show that he is incarcerated under\nconditions posing a substantial risk of serious harm.”).\n\n        Dental needs fall into the category “of serious medical needs” because “[d]ental\ncare is one of the most important needs of inmates.” McCarthy v. Place, 313 F. App’x\n810, 814 (6th Cir. 2008) (quoting Ramos v. Lamm, 639 F.2d 559, 576 (10th Cir. 1980)).\nThe Second Circuit has recognized that “[a] cognizable claim regarding inadequate\ndental care, like one involving medical care,” is “based on various factors, such as the\npain suffered by the plaintiff, the deterioration of the teeth due to a lack of treatment, or\nthe inability to engage in normal activities.” Chance v. Armstrong, 143 F.3d 698, 703\n(2d Cir. 1998). The Seventh Circuit has recognized the ability of prisoners to state a\ncognizable Eighth Amendment claim where they were denied oral hygiene supplies,\nspecifically toothpaste. Board v. Farnham, 394 F.3d 469, 481 (7th Cir. 2005). In Board,\nthe court found that certain prison officials were not entitled to qualified immunity when\nthey denied prisoners toothpaste for a three-and-a-half week period. Id. at 481-82.\nAdditionally, the prisoners alleged that they had requested toothpaste approximately 15\ntimes during the three-and-a-half week period. Id. at 481.\n\n        We have indicated that even though the physical injury required by § 1997e(e)\nfor a § 1983 claim need not be significant, it must be more than de minimis for an Eighth\nAmendment claim to go forward. See, e.g., Adams v. Rockafellow, 66 F. App’x 584, 586\n(6th Cir. 2003) (citing Siglar v. Hightower, 112 F.3d 191, 193 (5th Cir. 1997) and Luong\nv. Hatt, 979 F. Supp. 481, 485 (N.D.Tex. 1997)); Corsetti v. Tessmer, 41 F. App’x 753,\n755 (6th Cir. 2002) (citing Siglar and Luong in finding that two small bruises and minor\n\fNo. 09-1161        Flanory v. Bonn, et al.                                          Page 7\n\n\ncuts were de minimis injury); Styles v. McGinnis, 28 F. App’x 362, 364 (6th Cir. 2001)\n(citing Siglar); Benson v. Carlton, No. 99-6433, 2000 WL 1175609, at * 1 (6th Cir. Aug.\n9, 2000) (citing Siglar in finding that prisoner’s “whirling sensation” in head after\nmissing a meal was de minimis injury); see also Hudson v. McMillian, 503 U.S. 1, 9-10\n(1992) (holding that “cruel and unusual punishment necessarily excludes from\nconstitutional recognition de minimis uses of physical force”) (quotation and citation\nomitted). Courts have not found the objective component satisfied where the deprivation\nof hygiene items was temporary. Harris v. Fleming, 839 F.2d 1232, 1235-36 (7th Cir.\n1988) (no constitutional violation where prison officials failed to provide prisoner with\ntoilet paper for five days, and with soap, toothbrush, and toothpaste for ten days)); see\nalso McNatt v. Unit Manager Parker, No. 3:99-cv-1397, 2000 WL 307000, at *4\n(D.Conn. Jan.18, 2000) (no Eighth Amendment violation occurred when inmates\nendured, among other deprivations, no toiletries or clothing for six days). Given that the\ndeprivation of toothpaste in this case allegedly spanned 337 days, after which Flanory\nwas diagnosed with peridontal disease of the gums and one tooth was extracted,\nFlannory has shown both that the deprivation was not temporary and that he suffered\nphysical injury.\n\n       The subjective component requires a showing that prison officials knew of, and\nacted with deliberate indifference to, an inmate’s health or safety. Wilson, 501 U.S. at\n302-03; Talal, 403 F.3d at 426. Deliberate indifference “entails something more than\nmere negligence.” Farmer, 511 U.S. at 835. An inmate must show that prison officials\nhad “a sufficiently culpable state of mind” in denying medical care. Brown, 207 F.3d\nat 867 (citing Farmer, 511 U.S. at 834). In Brown, we noted that “[i]n prison-conditions\ncases that state of mind is one of deliberate indifference to inmate health or safety.” Id.\nThis standard is met if “the official knows of and disregards an excessive risk to inmate\nhealth or safety; the official must both be aware of facts from which the inference could\nbe drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists, and he must also draw the\ninference.” Id. (quoting Farmer, 511 U.S. at 837); see also Grose v. Caruso, 284 F.\nApp’x 279, 283 (6th Cir. 2008) (finding that prisoner’s allegations that officials failed\nto provide training to prevent the provision of inadequate medical care and implicitly\n\fNo. 09-1161            Flanory v. Bonn, et al.                                                    Page 8\n\n\nauthorized unconstitutional conduct should survive a motion to dismiss); Pack v. Martin,\n174 F. App’x 256, 259 (6th Cir. 2006) (“The party asserting a claim that medical care\nreceived was lacking or inadequate bears the burden of proving that the decision to\nprovide no, or substandard, medical care was deliberate or knowing.”); Davis v. Powell,\n110 F. App’x 660, 662 (6th Cir. 2004) (finding that prison officials were not deliberately\nindifferent to prisoner’s dental needs when prisoner was actively receiving ongoing\ndental care from physicians at the prison facility).\n\n         The Supreme Court has found “great difficulty agreeing that prison authorities\nmay not be deliberately indifferent to an inmate’s current health problems but may\nignore a condition of confinement that is sure or very likely to cause serious illness and\nneedless suffering the next week or month or year.” Helling v. McKinney, 509 U.S. 25,\n33 (1993) (finding that prisoner’s involuntary exposure to cellmate’s environmental\ntobacco smoke created an unreasonable health risk, thus subjecting him to cruel and\nunusual punishment). In Helling, the Supreme Court explicitly rejected “petitioners’\ncentral thesis that only deliberate indifference to current serious health problems of\ninmates is actionable under the Eighth Amendment.” Id. at 34.\n\n         Flanory alleges that he was completely denied toothpaste for 337 days; and this\nCourt has found dental health to be of great importance. McCarthy, 313 F. App’x at\n814. A prisoner whose inability to purchase hygiene items results from his rejection of\neducational status satisfies the objective and subjective requirements of an Eighth\nAmendment violation when he alleges a complete deprivation and shows that the\ndeprivation resulted from a deliberate indifference to hygiene needs.1 Indeed, other\ncircuits have found cognizable Eighth Amendment claims where, as here, inmates have\n\n         1\n            Where plaintiffs have failed to allege a deprivation of hygiene items resulting from deliberate\nindifference, we have found that their claims do not rise to the level of an Eighth Amendment violation.\nSee Argue v. Hofmeyer, 80 F. App’x 427, 430 (6th Cir. 2003) (holding that a prisoner had failed to state\nan Eighth Amendment claim because he did not allege a complete denial of hygiene products or that the\ndeprivation occurred out of indifference to his hygiene needs); Moore v. Chavez, 36 F. App’x 169, 171 (6th\nCir. 2002) (finding that the plaintiff had failed to allege that “he suffered extreme discomfort due to his\ninability to purchase the items or that he was completely denied the basic elements of hygiene”); see also\nBrown v. Brown, 46 F. App’x 324, 325-26 (6th Cir. 2002) (holding that a prisoner who was merely\ninconvenienced because he was unable to purchase personal hygiene supplies for several months due to\na hold on his account failed to state an Eighth Amendment claim); Brown v. Crowley, No. 99-2216, 2000\nWL 1175615, at *3 (6th Cir. Aug. 10, 2000) (“Brown’s allegations did not show that the defendants\nknowingly forced him to go without shampoo and toothpaste.”).\n\fNo. 09-1161        Flanory v. Bonn, et al.                                          Page 9\n\n\nbeen denied toothpaste. See Board, 394 F.3d at 481 (recognizing the ability of prisoners\nto state a cognizable Eighth Amendment claim where they were denied toothpaste); see\nalso Chance, 143 F.3d at 703 (holding that the plaintiff’s Eighth Amendment claim for\ninadequate dental care survived a motion to dismiss where he “alleged that, as the result\nof the defendants’ actions, he suffered extreme pain, his teeth deteriorated, and he [had]\nbeen unable to eat properly”). Here, Flannory also alleges not only a toothache and\nresulting tooth extraction, but also a gum disease that developed as a result of not having\nhad toothpaste with which to brush his teeth for almost a year. Denying an inmate\ntoothpaste for 337 days bespeaks an indifference to basic hygiene needs. In Board, the\nSeventh Circuit found an Eighth Amendment violation when prisoners went without\ntoothpaste for 3 1/2 weeks while being held in a jail for 126 days awaiting trial. Board,\n394 F.3d at 473. This time period pales in comparison to Flanory’s deprivation. Also,\nFlanory’s education classification involved an Associate Degree and GED, both of\nwhich were documented in the PSIR and were independently verified.\n\n        Flanory’s complete deprivation of toothpaste for 337 days and resulting health\nproblems amount to more than a mere inconvenience or a harmless deprivation of\nhygiene products, which would be insufficient to state an Eighth Amendment claim. See\nMoore, 36 F. App’x at 171; Argue, 80 F. App’x at 430. Further, the responses that\nFlanory received to his various grievances show that prison officials were aware that\nFlanory was without toothpaste as a result of his losing indigent status. Prison officials\nwere also aware that the only way for Flanory to obtain toothpaste would be for Flanory\nto purchase the item from the prison store. Indeed, Davis stated as much in his written\nresponse to Flannory’s second-step grievance when he wrote: “[b]ars of soap, shampoo,\ntooth swabs, and toilet paper are available in the housing units. The other hygiene items\nare available for purchase in the prisoner store.” (R. 1: Complaint Exs. p. 9.). We have\nrecognized an Eighth Amendment violation where the plaintiff can show an intent to\ninflict harm or punishment because the named defendants were involved in the denial\nof indigent status that resulted in the deprivation of hygiene items. Crowley, No. 99-\n2216, 2000 WL 1175615, at *3 (“Nothing indicates that Brown was deliberately denied\nshampoo or toothpaste by any named defendant who sought to punish him.”).\n\fNo. 09-1161        Flanory v. Bonn, et al.                                       Page 10\n\n\n       We are aware of cases within our circuit that have reached a contrary conclusion\nwhere a prisoner has rejected an education classification, but we find them to be\ndistinguishable. Moore, 36 F. App’x at 171; Argue, 80 F. App’x at 430. Moore\ninvolved a prisoner who refused to take a qualifying exam, and was therefore denied\nprison employment. Moore, 36 F. App’x at 170. The plaintiff in Moore, however,\nalleged neither a complete denial of the basic elements of hygiene nor any resulting\nserious discomfort. Id. at 170-71. Argue also involved a prisoner whose indigent status\nhad been revoked after he rejected an education classification and whose GED was never\nverified. Argue, 80 F. App’x at 428 n.2. In Argue, we found that the prisoner had failed\nto state an Eighth Amendment claim because he did not allege a complete denial of\nhygiene products or that the deprivation occurred out of indifference to his hygiene\nneeds. Id. at 430. Additionally, the prisoner in Argue did not allege that he had suffered\nany harm because he had been denied hygiene products. Id.\n\n       Flanory has alleged that he was completely denied certain hygiene items and that\nhe specifically was without toothpaste for a period of 337 days. Flanory has also alleged\nthat Defendants were aware that he was without toothpaste and were deliberately\nindifferent to his hygiene needs. He has also shown an injury in that he was diagnosed\nwith peridontal disease of the gums and had a tooth extracted. In his Complaint, Flanory\nhas made allegations which satisfy the objective and subjective components required for\nan Eighth Amendment violation. Therefore, Flanory has not failed to state a claim upon\nwhich relief could be granted. Flanory’s Eighth Amendment claim was improperly\ndismissed.\n\n                                  V. CONCLUSION\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we REVERSE the district court’s dismissal of\nFlanory’s Eighth Amendment claim and REMAND the case.\n\f",

MARBLEY, District Judge.</p>\n<p>Plaintiff-Appellant Jerry Flanory (\"Flanory\"), a prisoner proceeding <i>pro se,</i> appeals the decision of the district court to dismiss his Complaint for failure to state a claim against Defendants-Appellees Allen Bonn (\"Bonn\"), Robert Torp (\"Torp\"), Jeffrey Woods (\"Woods\"), Linda Tribley (\"Tribley\"), Alma Potts (\"Potts\"), Nancy Marshall (\"Marshall\"), Barry Davis (\"Davis\"), and Jim Armstrong (\"Armstrong\") (collectively, the \"Defendants\"). For the following reasons, we REVERSE the judgment of the district court and REMAND the case.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Flanory is currently incarcerated at the Mound Correctional Facility, but his claims pertain to events that took place while he was housed at the Newberry Correctional Facility (\"NCF\"). On or about December 12, 2004, Flanory was interviewed by Bonn, the Classification Director at NCF, for placement in the General Equivalent Degree (\"GED\") program at the facility. Flanory informed both Bonn and Torp, the principal of NCF's GED program, that he had obtained his GED from the Sarvis Educational Center many years before, and that he had since obtained an Associate Degree in General Studies from the Montcalm Community College. Flanory further advised that verification of his educational history could be found in his Presentence Investigation Report (\"PSIR\"). Torp informed Flanory that NCF policy prohibits the use of the PSIR for verification of educational history. Linda Tribley, the Assistant Deputy Warden at NCF, advised Flanory that it was his responsibility to provide documentation showing his educational achievements. Notwithstanding the fact that he already had his GED, and over his objections, Flanory was assigned to the GED program. Because he already had obtained his GED, Flanory refused to attend the class.</p>\n<p>On January 4, 2005, Flanory filed a grievance on the issues of his GED, Associate Degree, and PSIR, contesting the requirement that he participate in a GED class, which he had already completed, for a degree he had already obtained. On January 5, 2005, Flanory signed an Assignment Waiver Form to be removed from the GED program and the school roster. On January 28, 2005, Bonn placed Flanory on room restriction for waiving the GED program. Room restriction disqualified Flanory from indigent status. As a result, he was not able to purchase personal hygiene items, including toothpaste. In response to Flanory's grievance concerning the situation, Davis, NCF Warden, denied Flanory's grievance appeal, stating that Flanory would be ineligible for indigent status for a period of 12 months, and that certain hygiene items, including bars of soap, shampoo, tooth swabs, and toilet paper, were available in the housing units. Flanory then requested these items from Potts, NCF Assistant Resident Unit Supervisor, who responded that the items were not available. Toothpaste was among the hygiene items listed by Davis as only available for purchase in the prisoner store.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*252</span> In October 2005, Flanory met with the new principal of NCF's GED program, Mr. Belles, who then contacted Montcalm Community College and verified Flanory's Associate Degree. On November 10, 2005, Flanory was removed from room restriction and added to the work pool. After securing funds from his job assignment, Flanory requested his records from the Sarvis Educational Center. On April 18, 2006, Flanory received documentation showing that he had earned a GED.</p>\n<p>Flanory's placement on room restriction and his loss of indigent status caused him to be without toothpaste beginning in January 2005, for a period of 337 days. Flanory had undergone a dental examination in October 2004, which revealed no dental problems. In September 2005, Flanory experienced a toothache. After an examination, Flanory was diagnosed with peridontal disease of the gums, and one tooth was extracted.</p>\n<p>On May 1, 2008, Flanory initiated this action, which sought compensatory and punitive damages, alleging that his dental health declined because he was wrongfully placed on room restriction and denied indigent status, and he was not otherwise provided with dental hygiene supplies. Flanory claimed that Defendants violated the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 552a(e)(5), (g)(1)(c) and (g)(4), by failing to verify his educational credentials, which caused Defendants to place him on room restriction and deny him indigent status for approximately nine months. He further alleged that Defendants violated his Eighth Amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment by denying his access to dental hygiene supplies, including toothpaste, which led to his gum disease.</p>\n<p>On August 27, 2008, Magistrate Judge Greeley issued a Report and Recommendation that Flanory's Complaint be dismissed for failure to state a claim. On September 17, 2008, Flanory filed Objections to the Report and Recommendation. In his objections, Flanory conceded his Privacy Act claim. On January 5, 2009, the district court issued an Order approving and adopting the Report and Recommendation. <i>Flanory v. Bonn,</i> No. 2:08-cv-108, 2009 WL 33472 (W.D.Mich. Jan. 5, 2009). Flanory then timely filed this appeal.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. JURISDICTION</h2>\n<p>Because Flanory has appealed from a final judgment that disposed of all of his claims, we have jurisdiction based on 28 U.S.C. § 1291. This case has been referred to a panel of the court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(1), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, this panel unanimously agreed that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. STANDARD OF REVIEW</h2>\n<p>The Prison Litigation Reform Act, Pub.L. No. 103-134, 110 Stat. 1321 (1996), requires dismissal of any prisoner action brought under federal law if the complaint is frivolous, malicious, fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, or seeks monetary relief from a defendant immune from such relief. 28 U.S.C. §§ 1915(e), 1915A; 42 U.S.C. § 1997e. We review de novo a district court's dismissal of a complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1915(e), 1915A, and 42 U.S.C. § 1997e. <i>Grinter v. Knight,</i> 532 F.3d 567, 571-72 (6th Cir. 2008). \"A motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim is a test of the plaintiff's cause of action as stated in the complaint, not a challenge to the plaintiff's factual allegations.\" <i>Golden v. City of Columbus,</i> 404 F.3d 950, 958-59 (6th Cir.2005). A complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief could be granted when it is clear that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts consistent <span class=\"star-pagination\">*253</span> with the allegations that would entitle him to relief. <i>Jones v. City of Carlisle,</i> 3 F.3d 945, 947 (6th Cir.1993). A complaint that suggests \"the mere possibility of misconduct\" is insufficient; rather, the complaint must state \"a plausible claim for relief.\" <i>Ashcroft v. Iqbal,</i> ___ U.S. ___, ___, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1950, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (citing <i>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly,</i> 550 U.S. 544, 556, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007)). To state a claim for relief under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, a plaintiff must allege a violation of a right secured by the federal Constitution or laws and must show that the violation was committed by a person acting under color of state law. <i>West v. Atkins,</i> 487 U.S. 42, 48, 108 S.Ct. 2250, 101 L.Ed.2d 40 (1988); <i>Street v. Corrs. Corp. of Am.,</i> 102 F.3d 810, 814 (6th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV. ANALYSIS</h2>\n<p>Since Flanory conceded his Privacy Act claim earlier in the litigation, the only remaining claim is the alleged Eighth Amendment violation. The Eighth Amendment prohibits prison officials from \"unnecessarily and wantonly inflicting pain\" on prisoners by acting with \"deliberate indifference\" to prisoners' serious medical needs. <i>Blackmore v. Kalamazoo County,</i> 390 F.3d 890, 895 (6th Cir.2004) (quoting <i>Estelle v. Gamble,</i> 429 U.S. 97, 104, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976)). Failure to provide medical care may rise to the level of a violation of the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause of the Eighth Amendment where objective and subjective requirements are met. <i>Harrison v. Ash,</i> 539 F.3d 510, 517-18 (6th Cir.2008); <i>Farmer v. Brennan,</i> 511 U.S. 825, 833, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994).</p>\n<p>To satisfy the objective component, the injury must be sufficiently serious. <i>Wilson v. Seiter,</i> 501 U.S. 294, 297, 111 S.Ct. 2321, 115 L.Ed.2d 271 (1991) (stating that Eighth Amendment is implicated by the \"unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain\" and not \"inadvertent failure to provide adequate medical care\"); <i>Estelle,</i> 429 U.S. at 106, 97 S.Ct. 285 (\"In order to state a cognizable claim, a prisoner must allege acts or omissions sufficiently harmful to evidence deliberate indifference to serious medical needs.\"); <i>Talal v. White,</i> 403 F.3d 423, 426 (6th Cir.2005) (requiring that the prisoner demonstrate more than \"mere discomfort or inconvenience\"). In the context of \"conditions of confinement\" cases, the Eighth Amendment is concerned only with \"deprivations of essential food, medical care or sanitation\" or \"other conditions intolerable for prison.\" <i>Rhodes v. Chapman,</i> 452 U.S. 337, 347, 101 S.Ct. 2392, 69 L.Ed.2d 59 (1981); <i>see also </i><i>Brown v. Bargery,</i> 207 F.3d 863, 867 (6th Cir.2000) (citing <i>Farmer,</i> 511 U.S. at 834, 114 S.Ct. 1970) (\"[T]he inmate must show that he is incarcerated under conditions posing a substantial risk of serious harm.\").</p>\n<p>Dental needs fall into the category \"of serious medical needs\" because \"[d]ental care is one of the most important needs of inmates.\" <i>McCarthy v. Place,</i> 313 Fed. Appx. 810, 814 (6th Cir.2008) (quoting <i>Ramos v. Lamm,</i> 639 F.2d 559, 576 (10th Cir.1980)). The Second Circuit has recognized that \"[a] cognizable claim regarding inadequate dental care, like one involving medical care,\" is \"based on various factors, such as the pain suffered by the plaintiff, the deterioration of the teeth due to a lack of treatment, or the inability to engage in normal activities.\" <i>Chance v. Armstrong,</i> 143 F.3d 698, 703 (2d Cir.1998). The Seventh Circuit has recognized the ability of prisoners to state a cognizable Eighth Amendment claim where they were denied oral hygiene supplies, specifically toothpaste. <i>Board v. Farnham,</i> 394 F.3d 469, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*254</span> 481 (7th Cir.2005). In <i>Board,</i> the court found that certain prison officials were not entitled to qualified immunity when they denied prisoners toothpaste for a three-and-a-half week period. <i>Id.</i> at 481-82. Additionally, the prisoners alleged that they had requested toothpaste approximately 15 times during the three-and-a-half week period. <i>Id.</i> at 481.</p>\n<p>We have indicated that even though the physical injury required by § 1997e(e) for a § 1983 claim need not be significant, it must be more than <i>de minimis</i> for an Eighth Amendment claim to go forward. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Adams v. Rockafellow,</i> 66 Fed.Appx. 584, 586 (6th Cir.2003) (citing <i>Siglar v. Hightower,</i> 112 F.3d 191, 193 (5th Cir.1997) and <i>Luong v. Hatt,</i> 979 F.Supp. 481, 485 (N.D.Tex.1997)); <i>Corsetti v. Tessmer,</i> 41 Fed.Appx. 753, 755 (6th Cir.2002) (citing <i>Siglar</i> and <i>Luong</i> in finding that two small bruises and minor cuts were <i>de minimis</i> injury); <i>Styles v. McGinnis,</i> 28 Fed.Appx. 362, 364 (6th Cir. 2001) (citing <i>Siglar</i>); <i>Benson v. Carlton,</i> No. 99-6433, 2000 WL 1175609, at * 1 (6th Cir. Aug. 9, 2000) (citing <i>Siglar</i> in finding that prisoner's \"whirling sensation\" in head after missing a meal was <i>de minimis</i> injury); <i>see also </i><i>Hudson v. McMillian,</i> 503 U.S. 1, 9-10, 112 S.Ct. 995, 117 L.Ed.2d 156 (1992) (holding that \"cruel and unusual punishment necessarily excludes from constitutional recognition <i>de minimis</i> uses of physical force\") (quotation and citation omitted). Courts have not found the objective component satisfied where the deprivation of hygiene items was temporary. <i>Harris v. Fleming,</i> 839 F.2d 1232, 1235-36 (7th Cir.1988) (no constitutional violation where prison officials failed to provide prisoner with toilet paper for five days, and with soap, toothbrush, and toothpaste for ten days); <i>see also </i><i>McNatt v. Unit Manager Parker,</i> No. 3:99-cv-1397, 2000 WL 307000, at *4 (D.Conn.Jan. 18, 2000) (no Eighth Amendment violation occurred when inmates endured, among other deprivations, no toiletries or clothing for six days). Given that the deprivation of toothpaste in this case allegedly spanned 337 days, after which Flanory was diagnosed with peridontal disease of the gums and one tooth was extracted, Flanory has shown both that the deprivation was not temporary and that he suffered physical injury.</p>\n<p>The subjective component requires a showing that prison officials knew of, and acted with deliberate indifference to, an inmate's health or safety. <i>Wilson,</i> 501 U.S. at 302-03, 111 S.Ct. 2321; <i>Talal,</i> 403 F.3d at 426. Deliberate indifference \"entails something more than mere negligence.\" <i>Farmer,</i> 511 U.S. at 835, 114 S.Ct. 1970. An inmate must show that prison officials had \"a sufficiently culpable state of mind\" in denying medical care. <i>Brown,</i> 207 F.3d at 867 (citing <i>Farmer,</i> 511 U.S. at 834, 114 S.Ct. 1970). In <i>Brown,</i> we noted that \"[i]n prison-conditions cases that state of mind is one of deliberate indifference to inmate health or safety.\" <i>Id.</i> This standard is met if \"the official knows of and disregards an excessive risk to inmate health or safety; the official must both be aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists, and he must also draw the inference.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Farmer,</i> 511 U.S. at 837, 114 S.Ct. 1970); <i>see also </i><i>Grose v. Caruso,</i> 284 Fed.Appx. 279, 283 (6th Cir.2008) (finding that prisoner's allegations that officials failed to provide training to prevent the provision of inadequate medical care and implicitly authorized unconstitutional conduct should survive a motion to dismiss); <i>Pack v. Martin,</i> 174 FedAppx. 256, 259 (6th Cir.2006) (\"The party asserting a claim that medical care received was lacking or inadequate bears the burden of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*255</span> proving that the decision to provide no, or substandard, medical care was deliberate or knowing.\"); <i>Davis v. Powell,</i> 110 Fed. Appx. 660, 662 (6th Cir.2004) (finding that prison officials were not deliberately indifferent to prisoner's dental needs when prisoner was actively receiving ongoing dental care from physicians at the prison facility).</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court has found \"great difficulty agreeing that prison authorities may not be deliberately indifferent to an inmate's current health problems but may ignore a condition of confinement that is sure or very likely to cause serious illness and needless suffering the next week or month or year.\" <i>Helling v. McKinney,</i> 509 U.S. 25, 33, 113 S.Ct. 2475, 125 L.Ed.2d 22 (1993) (finding that prisoner's involuntary exposure to cellmate's environmental tobacco smoke created an unreasonable health risk, thus subjecting him to cruel and unusual punishment). In <i>Helling,</i> the Supreme Court explicitly rejected \"petitioners' central thesis that only deliberate indifference to current serious health problems of inmates is actionable under the Eighth Amendment.\" <i>Id.</i> at 34, 113 S.Ct. 2475.</p>\n<p>Flanory alleges that he was completely denied toothpaste for 337 days; and this Court has found dental health to be of great importance. <i>McCarthy,</i> 313 Fed.Appx. at 814. A prisoner whose inability to purchase hygiene items results from his rejection of educational status satisfies the objective and subjective requirements of an Eighth Amendment violation when he alleges a complete deprivation and shows that the deprivation resulted from a deliberate indifference to hygiene needs.<sup>[1]</sup> Indeed, other circuits have found cognizable Eighth Amendment claims where, as here, inmates have been denied toothpaste. <i>See </i><i>Board,</i> 394 F.3d at 481 (recognizing the ability of prisoners to state a cognizable Eighth Amendment claim where they were denied toothpaste); <i>see also </i><i>Chance,</i> 143 F.3d at 703 (holding that the plaintiff's Eighth Amendment claim for inadequate dental care survived a motion to dismiss where he \"alleged that, as the result of the defendants' actions, he suffered extreme pain, his teeth deteriorated, and he [had] been unable to eat properly\"). Here, Flanory also alleges not only a toothache and resulting tooth extraction, but also a gum disease that developed as a result of not having had toothpaste with which to brush his teeth for almost a year. Denying an inmate toothpaste for 337 days bespeaks an indifference to basic hygiene needs. In <i>Board,</i> the Seventh Circuit found an Eighth Amendment violation when prisoners went without toothpaste for 3 1/2 weeks while being <span class=\"star-pagination\">*256</span> held in a jail for 126 days awaiting trial. <i>Board,</i> 394 F.3d at 473. This time period pales in comparison to Flanory's deprivation. Also, Flanory's education classification involved an Associate Degree and GED, both of which were documented in the PSIR and were independently verified.</p>\n<p>Flanory's complete deprivation of toothpaste for 337 days and resulting health problems amount to more than a mere inconvenience or a harmless deprivation of hygiene products, which would be insufficient to state an Eighth Amendment claim. <i>See </i><i>Moore,</i> 36 Fed.Appx. at 171; <i>Argue,</i> 80 Fed.Appx. at 430. Further, the responses that Flanory received to his various grievances show that prison officials were aware that Flanory was without toothpaste as a result of his losing indigent status. Prison officials were also aware that the only way for Flanory to obtain toothpaste would be for Flanory to purchase the item from the prison store. Indeed, Davis stated as much in his written response to Flanory's second-step grievance when he wrote: \"[b]ars of soap, shampoo, tooth swabs, and toilet paper are available in the housing units. The other hygiene items are available for purchase in the prisoner store.\" (R. 1: Complaint Exs. p. 9.). We have recognized an Eighth Amendment violation where the plaintiff can show an intent to inflict harm or punishment because the named defendants were involved in the denial of indigent status that resulted in the deprivation of hygiene items. <i>Crowley,</i> No. 99-2216, 2000 WL 1175615, at *3 (\"Nothing indicates that Brown was deliberately denied shampoo or toothpaste by any named defendant who sought to punish him.\").</p>\n<p>We are aware of cases within our circuit that have reached a contrary conclusion where a prisoner has rejected an education classification, but we find them to be distinguishable. <i>Moore,</i> 36 Fed.Appx. at 171; <i>Argue,</i> 80 Fed.Appx. at 430. <i>Moore</i> involved a prisoner who refused to take a qualifying exam, and was therefore denied prison employment. <i>Moore,</i> 36 Fed.Appx. at 170. The plaintiff in <i>Moore,</i> however, alleged neither a complete denial of the basic elements of hygiene nor any resulting serious discomfort. <i>Id.</i> at 170-71. <i>Argue</i> also involved a prisoner whose indigent status had been revoked after he rejected an education classification and whose GED was never verified. <i>Argue,</i> 80 Fed.Appx. at 428 n. 2. In <i>Argue,</i> we found that the prisoner had failed to state an Eighth Amendment claim because he did not allege a complete denial of hygiene products or that the deprivation occurred out of indifference to his hygiene needs. <i>Id.</i> at 430. Additionally, the prisoner in <i>Argue</i> did not allege that he had suffered any harm because he had been denied hygiene products. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Flanory has alleged that he was completely denied certain hygiene items and that he specifically was without toothpaste for a period of 337 days. Flanory has also alleged that Defendants were aware that he was without toothpaste and were deliberately indifferent to his hygiene needs. He has also shown an injury in that he was diagnosed with peridontal disease of the gums and had a tooth extracted. In his Complaint, Flanory has made allegations which satisfy the objective and subjective components required for an Eighth Amendment violation. Therefore, Flanory has not failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. Flanory's Eighth Amendment claim was improperly dismissed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>V.

MARBLEY, District Judge.</p>\n<p>Plaintiff-Appellant Jerry Flanory (\"Flanory\"), a prisoner proceeding <i>pro se,</i> appeals the decision of the district court to dismiss his Complaint for failure to state a claim against Defendants-Appellees Allen Bonn (\"Bonn\"), Robert Torp (\"Torp\"), Jeffrey Woods (\"Woods\"), Linda Tribley (\"Tribley\"), Alma Potts (\"Potts\"), Nancy Marshall (\"Marshall\"), Barry Davis (\"Davis\"), and Jim Armstrong (\"Armstrong\") (collectively, the \"Defendants\"). For the following reasons, we REVERSE the judgment of the district court and REMAND the case.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Flanory is currently incarcerated at the Mound Correctional Facility, but his claims pertain to events that took place while he was housed at the Newberry Correctional Facility (\"NCF\"). On or about December 12, 2004, Flanory was interviewed by Bonn, the Classification Director at NCF, for placement in the General Equivalent Degree (\"GED\") program at the facility. Flanory informed both Bonn and Torp, the principal of NCF's GED program, that he had obtained his GED from the Sarvis Educational Center many years before, and that he had since obtained an Associate Degree in General Studies from the Montcalm Community College. Flanory further advised that verification of his educational history could be found in his Presentence Investigation Report (\"PSIR\"). Torp informed Flanory that NCF policy prohibits the use of the PSIR for verification of educational history. Linda Tribley, the Assistant Deputy Warden at NCF, advised Flanory that it was his responsibility to provide documentation showing his educational achievements. Notwithstanding the fact that he already had his GED, and over his objections, Flanory was assigned to the GED program. Because he already had obtained his GED, Flanory refused to attend the class.</p>\n<p>On January 4, 2005, Flanory filed a grievance on the issues of his GED, Associate Degree, and PSIR, contesting the requirement that he participate in a GED class, which he had already completed, for a degree he had already obtained. On January 5, 2005, Flanory signed an Assignment Waiver Form to be removed from the GED program and the school roster. On January 28, 2005, Bonn placed Flanory on room restriction for waiving the GED program. Room restriction disqualified Flanory from indigent status. As a result, he was not able to purchase personal hygiene items, including toothpaste. In response to Flanory's grievance concerning the situation, Davis, NCF Warden, denied Flanory's grievance appeal, stating that Flanory would be ineligible for indigent status for a period of 12 months, and that certain hygiene items, including bars of soap, shampoo, tooth swabs, and toilet paper, were available in the housing units. Flanory then requested these items from Potts, NCF Assistant Resident Unit Supervisor, who responded that the items were not available. Toothpaste was among the hygiene items listed by Davis as only available for purchase in the prisoner store.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*252</span> In October 2005, Flanory met with the new principal of NCF's GED program, Mr. Belles, who then contacted Montcalm Community College and verified Flanory's Associate Degree. On November 10, 2005, Flanory was removed from room restriction and added to the work pool. After securing funds from his job assignment, Flanory requested his records from the Sarvis Educational Center. On April 18, 2006, Flanory received documentation showing that he had earned a GED.</p>\n<p>Flanory's placement on room restriction and his loss of indigent status caused him to be without toothpaste beginning in January 2005, for a period of 337 days. Flanory had undergone a dental examination in October 2004, which revealed no dental problems. In September 2005, Flanory experienced a toothache. After an examination, Flanory was diagnosed with peridontal disease of the gums, and one tooth was extracted.</p>\n<p>On May 1, 2008, Flanory initiated this action, which sought compensatory and punitive damages, alleging that his dental health declined because he was wrongfully placed on room restriction and denied indigent status, and he was not otherwise provided with dental hygiene supplies. Flanory claimed that Defendants violated the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 552a(e)(5), (g)(1)(c) and (g)(4), by failing to verify his educational credentials, which caused Defendants to place him on room restriction and deny him indigent status for approximately nine months. He further alleged that Defendants violated his Eighth Amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment by denying his access to dental hygiene supplies, including toothpaste, which led to his gum disease.</p>\n<p>On August 27, 2008, Magistrate Judge Greeley issued a Report and Recommendation that Flanory's Complaint be dismissed for failure to state a claim. On September 17, 2008, Flanory filed Objections to the Report and Recommendation. In his objections, Flanory conceded his Privacy Act claim. On January 5, 2009, the district court issued an Order approving and adopting the Report and Recommendation. <i>Flanory v. Bonn,</i> No. 2:08-cv-108, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2009</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">33472</span></span> (W.D.Mich. Jan. 5, 2009). Flanory then timely filed this appeal.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. JURISDICTION</h2>\n<p>Because Flanory has appealed from a final judgment that disposed of all of his claims, we have jurisdiction based on 28 U.S.C. § 1291. This case has been referred to a panel of the court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(1), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, this panel unanimously agreed that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. STANDARD OF REVIEW</h2>\n<p>The Prison Litigation Reform Act, Pub.L. No. 103-134, 110 Stat. 1321 (1996), requires dismissal of any prisoner action brought under federal law if the complaint is frivolous, malicious, fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, or seeks monetary relief from a defendant immune from such relief. 28 U.S.C. §§ 1915(e), 1915A; 42 U.S.C. § 1997e. We review de novo a district court's dismissal of a complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1915(e), 1915A, and 42 U.S.C. § 1997e. <i>Grinter v. Knight,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1422776\"><a href=\"/opinion/1422776/grinter-v-knight/\"><span class=\"volume\">532</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">567</span></a></span>, 571-72 (6th Cir. 2008). \"A motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim is a test of the plaintiff's cause of action as stated in the complaint, not a challenge to the plaintiff's factual allegations.\" <i>Golden v. City of Columbus,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"789932\"><a href=\"/opinion/789932/hazel-golden-v-city-of-columbus-cheryl-roberto-director-of-public/\"><span class=\"volume\">404</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">950</span></a></span>, 958-59 (6th Cir.2005). A complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief could be granted when it is clear that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts consistent <span class=\"star-pagination\">*253</span> with the allegations that would entitle him to relief. <i>Jones v. City of Carlisle,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"629008\"><a href=\"/opinion/629008/james-ricky-jones-vera-jones-aik-selective-self-insurance-fund/\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">945</span></a></span>, 947 (6th Cir.1993). A complaint that suggests \"the mere possibility of misconduct\" is insufficient; rather, the complaint must state \"a plausible claim for relief.\" <i>Ashcroft v. Iqbal,</i> ___ U.S. ___, ___, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145875\"><a href=\"/opinion/145875/ashcroft-v-iqbal/\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">929</span></a></span> (2007)). To state a claim for relief under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, a plaintiff must allege a violation of a right secured by the federal Constitution or laws and must show that the violation was committed by a person acting under color of state law. <i>West v.

ANALYSIS</h2>\n<p>Since Flanory conceded his Privacy Act claim earlier in the litigation, the only remaining claim is the alleged Eighth Amendment violation. The Eighth Amendment prohibits prison officials from \"unnecessarily and wantonly inflicting pain\" on prisoners by acting with \"deliberate indifference\" to prisoners' serious medical needs. <i>Blackmore v.

A prisoner whose inability to purchase hygiene items results from his rejection of educational status satisfies the objective and subjective requirements of an Eighth Amendment violation when he alleges a complete deprivation and shows that the deprivation resulted from a deliberate indifference to hygiene needs.<sup>[1]</sup> Indeed, other circuits have found cognizable Eighth Amendment claims where, as here, inmates have been denied toothpaste. <i>See </i><i>Board,</i> 394 F.3d at 481 (recognizing the ability of prisoners to state a cognizable Eighth Amendment claim where they were denied toothpaste); <i>see also </i><i>Chance,</i> 143 F.3d at 703 (holding that the plaintiff's Eighth Amendment claim for inadequate dental care survived a motion to dismiss where he \"alleged that, as the result of the defendants' actions, he suffered extreme pain, his teeth deteriorated, and he [had] been unable to eat properly\"). Here, Flanory also alleges not only a toothache and resulting tooth extraction, but also a gum disease that developed as a result of not having had toothpaste with which to brush his teeth for almost a year. Denying an inmate toothpaste for 337 days bespeaks an indifference to basic hygiene needs. In <i>Board,</i> the Seventh Circuit found an Eighth Amendment violation when prisoners went without toothpaste for 3 1/2 weeks while being <span class=\"star-pagination\">*256</span> held in a jail for 126 days awaiting trial. <i>Board,</i> 394 F.3d at 473. This time period pales in comparison to Flanory's deprivation. Also, Flanory's education classification involved an Associate Degree and GED, both of which were documented in the PSIR and were independently verified.</p>\n<p>Flanory's complete deprivation of toothpaste for 337 days and resulting health problems amount to more than a mere inconvenience or a harmless deprivation of hygiene products, which would be insufficient to state an Eighth Amendment claim. <i>See </i><i>Moore,</i> 36 Fed.Appx. at 171; <i>Argue,</i> 80 Fed.Appx. at 430. Further, the responses that Flanory received to his various grievances show that prison officials were aware that Flanory was without toothpaste as a result of his losing indigent status. Prison officials were also aware that the only way for Flanory to obtain toothpaste would be for Flanory to purchase the item from the prison store. Indeed, Davis stated as much in his written response to Flanory's second-step grievance when he wrote: \"[b]ars of soap, shampoo, tooth swabs, and toilet paper are available in the housing units. The other hygiene items are available for purchase in the prisoner store.\" (R. 1: Complaint Exs. p. 9.). We have recognized an Eighth Amendment violation where the plaintiff can show an intent to inflict harm or punishment because the named defendants were involved in the denial of indigent status that resulted in the deprivation of hygiene items. <i>Crowley,</i> No. 99-2216, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2000</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1175615</span></span>, at *3 (\"Nothing indicates that Brown was deliberately denied shampoo or toothpaste by any named defendant who sought to punish him.\").</p>\n<p>We are aware of cases within our circuit that have reached a contrary conclusion where a prisoner has rejected an education classification, but we find them to be distinguishable. <i>Moore,</i> 36 Fed.Appx. at 171; <i>Argue,</i> 80 Fed.Appx. at 430. <i>Moore</i> involved a prisoner who refused to take a qualifying exam, and was therefore denied prison employment. <i>Moore,</i> 36 Fed.Appx. at 170. The plaintiff in <i>Moore,</i> however, alleged neither a complete denial of the basic elements of hygiene nor any resulting serious discomfort. <i>Id.</i> at 170-71. <i>Argue</i> also involved a prisoner whose indigent status had been revoked after he rejected an education classification and whose GED was never verified. <i>Argue,</i> 80 Fed.Appx. at 428 n. 2. In <i>Argue,</i> we found that the prisoner had failed to state an Eighth Amendment claim because he did not allege a complete denial of hygiene products or that the deprivation occurred out of indifference to his hygiene needs. <i>Id.</i> at 430. Additionally, the prisoner in <i>Argue</i> did not allege that he had suffered any harm because he had been denied hygiene products. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Flanory has alleged that he was completely denied certain hygiene items and that he specifically was without toothpaste for a period of 337 days. Flanory has also alleged that Defendants were aware that he was without toothpaste and were deliberately indifferent to his hygiene needs. He has also shown an injury in that he was diagnosed with peridontal disease of the gums and had a tooth extracted. In his Complaint, Flanory has made allegations which satisfy the objective and subjective components required for an Eighth Amendment violation. Therefore, Flanory has not failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. Flanory's Eighth Amendment claim was improperly dismissed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>V. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, we REVERSE the district court's dismissal of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*257</span> Flanory's Eighth Amendment claim and REMAND the case.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  The Honorable Algenon L. Marbley, United States District Judge for the Southern District of Ohio, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  Where plaintiffs have failed to allege a deprivation of hygiene items resulting from deliberate indifference, we have found that their claims do not rise to the level of an Eighth Amendment violation. <i>See </i><i>Argue v. Hofmeyer,</i> 80 Fed.Appx. 427, 430 (6th Cir.2003) (holding that a prisoner had failed to state an Eighth Amendment claim because he did not allege a complete denial of hygiene products or that the deprivation occurred out of indifference to his hygiene needs); <i>Moore v. Chavez,</i> 36 Fed.Appx. 169, 171 (6th Cir.2002) (finding that the plaintiff had failed to allege that \"he suffered extreme discomfort due to his inability to purchase the items or that he was completely denied the basic elements of hygiene\"); <i>see also Brown v.
