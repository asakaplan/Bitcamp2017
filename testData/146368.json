Trudy Griffin was brought to the\nDavidson County Criminal Justice Center after she was arrested for disorderly conduct.\nWhen Griffin created a disturbance while speaking with a nurse at the Center, two\ncorrections officers, Darrell Hardrick and Pamela Rutledge, each took one of her arms and\n\n\n                                            1\n\fNo. 09-5757         Griffin v.

Griffin at that point began\nstruggling with the officers, causing Hardrick to perform a “leg-sweep maneuver” to bring\nGriffin to the floor so that she could be handcuffed and taken back to her holding cell. As\nGriffin fell to the floor, however, Rutledge tumbled with her. Rutledge accidentally landed\non one of Griffin’s legs, breaking Griffin’s tibia.\n\n        Griffin sued Hardrick over the incident, alleging an excessive-force claim under\n42 U.S.C. § 1983 as well as a state-law claim for battery. The district court granted\nHardrick’s motion for summary judgment, holding that no reasonable jury could find that\nHardrick had intended the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain when he tripped\nGriffin. For the reasons set forth below, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.\n\n                                    I. BACKGROUND\n\nA.      Factual background\n\n        Griffin was arrested on August 20, 2005 for disorderly conduct and resisting arrest.\nShe was transported to the Davidson County Criminal Justice Center (Center) for booking.\nWhile she was in a holding cell at the Center, Griffin asked permission to go to the nurse’s\nstation. After permission was granted, she walked down the hall to speak with a nurse about\nbruises on her back and arms. Griffin repeatedly demanded that she be transported to a local\nhospital so that she could be treated for these injuries. When the nurse told Griffin that she\nwould not be taken to a hospital, Griffin refused to take “no” for an answer and began raising\nher voice with the nurse. At this point, Hardrick, a corrections officer with the Davidson\nCounty Sheriff’s Office who was in charge of the booking area, approached Griffin.\n\n        Both parties agree that “Hardrick observed [Griffin] acting in a non-compliant\nmanner with regard to the instructions she received from the nurse,” and that Griffin “walked\naway from Hardrick when he attempted to speak with her about the situation.” Griffin\nclaims that as she walked away, Hardrick threatened her by saying that “she was going to\nlive in his hell” and that she “was his bitch.” Hardrick then took hold of one of Griffin’s\narms, but Griffin attempted to pull away. Griffin claims that she told Hardrick to “watch her\narms” because they were sore from being bruised earlier.\n\fNo. 09-5757         Griffin v. Hardrick                                               Page 3\n\n\n        At that point, Hardrick asked Rutledge, another corrections officer at the Center, to\nassist with the situation. When Rutledge reached for Griffin’s other arm, Griffin pulled her\narm away (although she contends that she pulled away only “a little bit”). Hardrick and\nRutledge then began leading Griffin down the hall toward her holding cell. Griffin claims\nthat she was not struggling, resisting, or acting aggressively. She asserts that Hardrick\nnevertheless suddenly tripped her, causing her to fall to the floor. This in turn caused\nRutledge to accidentally fall on top of her, which fractured Griffin’s tibia.\n\n        Hardrick, on the other hand, contends that Griffin was jerking and attempting to get\naway. This prompted him to perform a “leg-sweep maneuver,” typically used by officers to\nbring a noncompliant individual to the ground with the least amount of force necessary. He\ndoes not dispute, however, that Rutledge accidentally fell on Griffin’s leg as a result of the\nleg sweep. After Griffin was handcuffed on the ground, other Center employees carried her\ninto the holding-cell area. An ambulance was then called to the Center for the purpose of\ntaking Griffin to the hospital, where she required surgery, eight screws, and a metal plate to\nfix her broken tibia.\n\n        A security camera caught the incident on videotape. The video establishes that\nGriffin approached the nurse’s station and remained there for just under 10 minutes,\nalternating between standing at the window and sitting in a chair placed by the station. She\ncan be seen motioning and waiving her arms at various points throughout her conversation\nwith the nurse. Hardrick walked toward Griffin and spoke with her for approximately 20\nseconds before Rutledge approached the nurse’s station and stood a few feet away from\nHardrick and Griffin.\n\n        After another 10 seconds, Griffin began to walk away from Hardrick, who then\nreached out to take her right arm. Griffin attempted to jerk her arm away, but Hardrick\nmaintained his grip, and Rutledge stepped in to take Griffin’s left arm. After a second or two\nof struggling with Griffin outside the nurse’s station, Hardrick and Rutledge began to escort\nher down the hallway, which she resisted. Hardrick then stuck out his leg to trip Griffin. At\nthis point, Griffin fell to the floor, and Rutledge tumbled on top of her.\n\fNo. 09-5757          Griffin v. Hardrick                                               Page 4\n\n\nB.       Procedural history\n\n         In May 2006, Griffin filed a lawsuit in a Tennessee state court against Hardrick and\nthe Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County (Metro), alleging a claim\nof battery under the Tennessee Governmental Tort Liability Act. See Tenn. Code Ann.\n§§ 29-20-101 to -408. Griffin later dismissed her claim against Metro, but added an\nexcessive-force claim against Hardrick pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Section 1983 provides\na cause of action against those who violate a person’s constitutional rights while acting under\ncolor of state law. This caused Hardrick to timely remove the case to the United States\nDistrict Court for the Middle District of Tennessee.\n\n         Hardrick subsequently moved for summary judgment. In response to Griffin’s\n§ 1983 claim, he argued that not only was he entitled to qualified immunity, but that\nGriffin’s claim could not succeed on the merits because Hardrick’s use of force did not\nconstitute the wanton infliction of pain. Hardrick further contended that he used only the\namount of force necessary to subdue Griffin, so that her battery claim was likewise without\nmerit.\n\n         The district court granted Hardrick’s motion for summary judgment in June 2009.\nBecause the court concluded that no reasonable jury could find that Hardrick’s conduct\nconstituted the wanton infliction of pain, it did not address Hardrick’s qualified-immunity\nargument. The court also decided that where the identical use of force leads to both a § 1983\nclaim and a state-law battery claim, the same standard applies to both causes of action. It\ntherefore granted summary judgment to Hardrick on Griffin’s state-law battery claim as well.\nGriffin has timely appealed.\n\n                                      II. ANALYSIS\n\nA.       Standard of review\n\n         We review de novo a district court’s grant of summary judgment. ACLU of Ky. v.\nGrayson County, 591 F.3d 837, 843 (6th Cir. 2010). Summary judgment is proper where\nno genuine issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a\nmatter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(2). In considering a motion for summary judgment, the\ndistrict court must draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.\n\fNo. 09-5757         Griffin v. Hardrick                                                 Page 5\n\n\nMatsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587 (1986). The central\nissue is “whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to\na jury or whether it is so one-sided that one party must prevail as a matter of law.” Anderson\nv. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 251-52 (1986).\n\nB.      Griffin’s § 1983 claim\n\n        Section 1983 prohibits a person “acting under color of state law” from depriving an\nindividual “of a right secured by the Federal Constitution or laws of the United States.”\nWolotsky v. Huhn, 960 F.2d 1331, 1335 (6th Cir. 1992). Griffin’s complaint alleged that\nHardrick violated § 1983 by using excessive force against her in violation of the\nFourth Amendment. The district court, however, interpreted her claim as alleging a\nviolation of the Fourteenth Amendment, and Griffin does not dispute this characterization\non appeal.\n\n        Prisoners are protected from the use of excessive force by the Eighth Amendment.\nWhitley v. Albers, 475 U.S. 312, 327 (1986). As a pretrial detainee, however, Griffin’s\nrights stem from the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which “protects a\npretrial detainee from the use of excessive force that amounts to punishment.” Graham v.\nConnor, 490 U.S. 386, 395 n.10 (1989). The law is unsettled as to whether the analysis for\na Fourteenth Amendment excessive-force claim and an Eighth Amendment excessive-force\nclaim is the same. See Leary v. Livingston County, 528 F.3d 438, 443 (6th Cir. 2008)\n(“[T]here is room for debate over whether the Due Process Clause grants pretrial detainees\nmore protections than the Eighth Amendment does . . . .”). Compare Orem v. Rephann, 523\nF.3d 442, 446 (4th Cir. 2008) (applying the Eighth Amendment standard to a pretrial\ndetainee’s excessive-force claim under the Fourteenth Amendment), with Wilson v. Williams,\n83 F.3d 870, 875 (7th Cir. 1996) (“Since [the protection of the Fourteenth Amendment]\nextends beyond the prohibition of merely ‘cruel and unusual’ punishment, pretrial detainees\nmust arguably be afforded a higher standard than that provided by the Eighth Amendment.”).\n\n        In the instant case, however, both parties and the district court relied on this court’s\nunpublished decision in Watkins v. Evans, Nos. 95-4162, 95-4341, 1996 WL 499094, at *2\n(6th Cir. Sept. 3, 1996), which held that the standards are the same. Because Griffin does\nnot seek to invoke the potentially broader protections of the Fourteenth Amendment, we will\n\fNo. 09-5757          Griffin v. Hardrick                                               Page 6\n\n\nanalyze her claim under the Eighth Amendment standard. See Lewis v. Downey, 581 F.3d\n467, 475 (7th Cir. 2009) (analyzing a pretrial detainee’s excessive-force claim under the\nsame standard as an Eighth Amendment excessive-force claim where the detainee did not\nseek to invoke “any safeguards the Fourteenth Amendment provides beyond those it shares\nwith the Eighth Amendment”).\n\n         The test for whether the use of force violates the Eighth Amendment requires a court\nto determine if the defendant’s conduct caused the “unnecessary and wanton infliction of\npain.” Moore v. Holbrook, 2 F.3d 697, 700 (6th Cir. 1993) (citation omitted). In other\nwords,\n\n         [t]o ascertain whether excessive force was used under the Eighth\n         Amendment, the court must determine whether the force was applied in a\n         good-faith effort to maintain or restore discipline, or maliciously and\n         sadistically to cause harm. Such a claim has both an objective and a\n         subjective component. The objective component requires that the pain be\n         serious. The subjective component requires that the offending, non-penal\n         conduct be wanton.\n\nWatkins, 1996 WL 499094, at *2 (citations omitted).\n\n         Hardrick does not dispute that Griffin suffered serious pain, so the objective element\nis satisfied. We must therefore determine if a genuine issue exists as to whether Hardrick’s\nconduct in using the leg-sweep maneuver on Griffin was “applied in a good-faith effort to\nmaintain or restore discipline, or maliciously and sadistically to cause harm.” See id.\n\n         As an initial matter, Griffin argues that the district court erred in considering the\nvideotape when ruling on Hardrick’s motion for summary judgment. The Supreme Court,\nhowever, has held that a court may properly consider videotape evidence at the summary-\njudgment stage. “When opposing parties tell two different stories, one of which is blatantly\ncontradicted by the record, so that no reasonable jury could believe it, a court should not\nadopt that version of the facts for purposes of ruling on a motion for summary judgment.”\nScott v. Harris, 550 U.S. 372, 380 (2007) (holding that, based on videotape evidence, a\npolice officer did not use excessive force in ramming a fleeing suspect’s car). Moreover, the\nreasonableness of a defendant’s actions is an appropriate matter to determine on summary\njudgment. Dunn v. Matatall, 549 F.3d 348, 353 (6th Cir. 2008) (explaining that Scott\n\fNo. 09-5757           Griffin v. Hardrick                                                   Page 7\n\n\n“instructs us to determine as a matter of law whether the events depicted on [a] video, taken\nin the light most favorable to [the nonmoving party], show that the Officers’ conduct was\nobjectively reasonable”). The district court thus properly considered the videotape evidence\nin determining whether Hardrick’s actions were wanton.\n\n          Turning now to whether Hardrick’s use of force was excessive, this court has\npreviously cautioned that an official’s decision to use force is entitled to deference:\n\n          [O]fficials confronted with a prison disturbance must balance the threat\n          [that] unrest poses to inmates, prison workers, administrators, and visitors\n          against the harm inmates may suffer if guards use force. Because prison\n          officials must make their decisions in haste, under pressure, and frequently\n          without the luxury of a second chance, we must grant them wide-ranging\n          deference in the adoption and execution of policies and practices that in their\n          judgment are needed to preserve internal order and discipline and to\n          maintain institutional security.\n\nCombs v. Wilkinson, 315 F.3d 548, 557 (6th Cir. 2002) (first alteration in original) (citations\nand internal quotation marks omitted). The issue is therefore not whether the use of force\nwas absolutely necessary in hindsight, but “whether the use of force could plausibly have\nbeen thought necessary, or instead evinced such wantonness with respect to the unjustified\ninfliction of harm as is tantamount to a knowing willingness that it occur.” Whitley, 475 U.S.\nat 321.\n\n          Griffin does not dispute that she was acting in a noncompliant manner toward the\nnurse, that she walked away from Hardrick while he was speaking with her, and that she\nattempted to jerk her arm away from Hardrick. As is evident from the video, Hardrick was\ncalm and nonaggressive during his initial conversation with Griffin. He stood at least a foot\naway from Griffin and spoke with her for about 30 seconds before ever touching her. Most\nimportantly, the video establishes that Griffin was clearly struggling against both Hardrick\nand Rutledge before Hardrick employed the leg-sweep maneuver.\n\n          The fact that Griffin had been engaged in a loud, lengthy, and animated conversation\nwith the nurse gave Hardrick a reasonable basis to believe that force would be necessary to\ncontrol Griffin. Similarly, Griffin was struggling against Hardrick and Rutledge as they\nattempted to lead her away from the nurse’s station, giving Hardrick a plausible reason to\nbelieve that force was necessary to bring Griffin to the floor so that she could be handcuffed\n\fNo. 09-5757           Griffin v. Hardrick                                              Page 8\n\n\nand taken back to her holding cell. Hardrick’s initial calm demeanor with Griffin suggests\nthat he was not seeking to wantonly inflict pain on her, but was attempting to bring her under\ncontrol.\n\n           Griffin does not dispute that Hardrick was in compliance with all relevant Center\npolicies on the use of force, and she does not dispute Hardrick’s contention that he was\nacting according to his training when employing the leg-sweep maneuver. Indeed, to counter\nthe fact that Hardrick was responding to the situation as trained, Griffin argues only that the\nopinion of the subject-control instructor for the Davidson County Sheriff’s Office—that the\nleg-sweep maneuver was proper under the circumstances—was based on the video, which\ntestimony she claims would invade the province of the jury and should therefore have been\nexcluded from consideration on summary judgment.\n\n           But as discussed above, a court may properly consider videotape evidence at the\nsummary-judgment stage, Scott, 550 U.S. at 380-81, so an expert opinion based on such\nevidence is appropriate, see Fed. R. Evid. 702; Brainard v. Am. Skandia Life Assurance\nCorp., 432 F.3d 655, 663 (6th Cir. 2005) (holding that an expert opinion is permitted at the\nsummary judgment stage so long as the opinion is not “a conclusory assertion about ultimate\nlegal issues” (citation omitted)). The fact that Hardrick was acting according to established\nprocedures suggests that he had not undertaken the leg-sweep maneuver in a wanton manner,\nbut was acting as he was trained while attempting to gain control of Griffin. Moreover, there\nis no basis whatsoever to infer that Hardrick intended to use such force as would break\nGriffin’s leg. The force that did so came solely from the unfortunate accident of Rutledge\ncollapsing on Griffin as they both fell to the floor. These circumstances do not support a\n§ 1983 claim for the wanton infliction of pain on the part of Hardrick.\n\n           In response to the adverse ruling by the district court, Griffin argues that she\npresented several genuine issues of material fact sufficient to defeat Hardrick’s motion for\nsummary judgment. Griffin, for example, contends that “Hardrick never denied that Griffin\nreceived injuries to her arms before coming into the [Center],” and that he “never denied that\nhe made threats towards Griffin that ‘she was going to live in his hell’ and that she ‘was his\nbitch.’” But these alleged threats do not create a genuine issue of material fact under the\nparticular circumstances here because the videotape shows that Griffin was still struggling\n\fNo. 09-5757         Griffin v. Hardrick                                                Page 9\n\n\nwith the officers at the time Hardrick employed the leg-sweep maneuver. So at that moment,\nHardrick had a reasonable basis to believe that further force was necessary to control Griffin,\neven if he had earlier made the alleged generalized threats against her.\n\n        Griffin next argues that she was walking away because she was scared of Hardrick\nand wanted to return to her holding cell, thus creating a genuine issue of material fact. But\nthis allegation is not material even if it is true (which seems doubtful given Hardrick’s calm\ndemeanor as shown on the videotape when he initially interacted with Griffin). Whether or\nnot she felt that she had a good reason for walking away, Griffin was still noncompliant with\nthe nurse and was resisting Hardrick and Rutledge before Hardrick used the leg-sweep\nmaneuver. Moreover, Griffin has never contended that she communicated her alleged\nmotivation to Hardrick, so her reason for noncompliance is irrelevant as to whether Hardrick\nreasonably thought that force was necessary to bring Griffin under control.\n\n        Other issues cited by Griffin are clearly contradicted by the record. She claims that\nHardrick tripped her without provocation and that at no time did she resist either Hardrick\nor Rutledge. To the contrary, the video clearly shows Griffin resisting the officers’ efforts\nto lead her down the hallway and her efforts to break away from them.\n\n        The district court thus did not err in granting Hardrick’s motion for summary\njudgment on Griffin’s § 1983 excessive-force claim. Although we consider this to be a close\ncase, we ultimately conclude that no reasonable jury could find that Hardrick “evinced such\nwantonness . . . as is tantamount to a knowing willingness” that Griffin’s injury occur. See\nWhitley v. Abers, 475 U.S. 312, 321 (1986). We therefore need not decide the merits of\nHardrick’s argument that he is entitled to qualified immunity.\n\nC.      Griffin’s state-law battery claim\n\n        In addition to her § 1983 claim, Griffin alleged a state-law battery claim against\nHardrick. Griffin brought this claim under the Tennessee Governmental Tort Liability Act,\nwhich permits individuals to bring a cause of action against governmental employees who\nallegedly commit intentional torts. See Baines v. Wilson County, 86 S.W.3d 575, 583 n.5\n(Tenn. Ct. App. 2002). Griffin’s appellate brief, however, does not mention her battery\nclaim. Indeed, her Statement of the Case references only an excessive-force violation against\n\fNo. 09-5757          Griffin v. Hardrick                                                Page 10\n\n\nHardrick pursuant to § 1983. Nor was her battery claim mentioned at oral argument. She\nhas therefore likely abandoned this claim on appeal. See Marks v. Newcourt Credit Group,\nInc., 342 F.3d 444, 462 (6th Cir. 2003) (“An appellant waives an issue when he fails to\npresent it in his initial briefs before this court.”). But see Madden v. Chattanooga City Wide\nServ. Dep’t, 549 F.3d 666, 673 (6th Cir. 2008) (holding that where the same analysis applies\nto a plaintiff’s federal and state-law causes of action, a defendant does not waive its defense\nto the state-law claim by failing to present the state-law claim on appeal if it argued the\nfederal claim).\n\n         But even if Griffin has not abandoned this claim, it fails on the merits. Where a\nplaintiff asserts a battery claim under Tennessee law that arises out of the same use of force\nas her § 1983 excessive-force claim, the analysis is the same for both causes of action. That\nis, “whether the analysis concerns whether an officer violated a plaintiff’s constitutional\nrights by using excessive force or whether the analysis concerns whether an officer\ncommitted state-law battery by using force that was ‘clearly excessive,’ the same principles\n. . . are applied.” Lee v. Metro. Gov’t of Nashville & Davidson County, 596 F. Supp. 2d\n1101, 1118 (M.D. Tenn. 2009) (holding that officers entitled to summary judgment on a\n§ 1983 excessive-force claim were automatically entitled to summary judgment on the\nTennessee common-law battery claim); see also Harris v. Metro. Gov’t of Nashville, No.\n3:06-0868, 2007 WL 4481176, at *9 (M.D. Tenn. Dec. 18, 2007) (“[T]he plaintiff has set\nforth adequate grounds for his [§ 1983] claim of excessive force against each of the officers.\nBecause Tennessee courts apply the same ‘excessive force’ principles to assault and battery\nclaims against police officers, the plaintiff has additionally set forth adequate grounds against\neach of the officers for assault and battery under Tennessee law.”). We thus find no error\nin the district court’s conclusion that because Hardrick was entitled to summary judgment\non Griffin’s § 1983 claim, he was also entitled to summary judgment on her state-law battery\nclaim.\n\n                                    III. CONCLUSION\n\n         For all of the reasons set forth above, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.\n\fNo. 09-5757         Griffin v.

WHITE, Circuit Judge (dissenting). I respectfully dissent. I agree that\nit is appropriate for the court to consider a video of the events when ruling on a motion for\nsummary judgment, and to discount any allegations clearly rebutted by the video. I do not,\nhowever, agree that the video in this case clearly undermines Griffin’s account leaving no\ngenuine issue of material fact. I would reverse and remand for further proceedings.\n\n        In my view, the videotape does not “blatantly contradict[]” Griffin’s version of the\nfacts “so that no reasonable jury could believe” her, and therefore summary judgment was\nnot appropriate. Scott v. Harris, 550 U.S. 372, 380-81 (2007). Under Scott, in determining\nwhether there are material factual disputes, we must accept the facts as depicted in the video,\neven when contrary to a party’s sworn testimony. However, facts that are not clearly\nportrayed in the video remain entitled to an interpretation most favorable to the non-moving\nparty. Morales v. American Honda Motor Co., Inc., 71 F.3d 531, 535 (6th Cir. 1995); see\nScott, 550 U.S. at 380 (facts must be viewed in a light most favorable to non-moving party\nwhen there is a “genuine dispute as to those facts”). Accepting all events portrayed in the\nvideo as true, there remains a material factual dispute as to whether Hardrick performed the\ntakedown maneuver maliciously and sadistically to cause harm, rather than “in a good-faith\neffort to maintain or restore discipline.” Hudson v. McMillian, 503 U.S. 1, 6 (1992).\n\n        In Scott, the Court found that the plaintiff’s claim that he was driving in a “cautious\nand controlled” fashion was clearly rebutted by the video that showed him traveling upwards\nof 85 miles per hour on narrow roads, swerving around cars, crossing the double-yellow line,\nforcing other cars traveling in both directions to the side of the road, running multiple red\nlights, and driving in the left-turn-only lane. Id. at 379-80. The video here, however, does\nnot definitively establish either what transpired prior to Hardrick executing the takedown\nmaneuver, or that Hardrick did not act maliciously or wantonly in executing the maneuver.\n\n        Griffin contends that Hardrick told her “she was going to live in hell” and that she\n“was his bitch.” The video, which has no accompanying audio, does not contradict this\nallegation. The district court’s perception of the “calmness” of Hardrick’s demeanor is not\n\fNo. 09-5757         Griffin v. Hardrick                                              Page 12\n\n\nincompatible with his having made these statements to Griffin, and thus, at this point in the\nlitigation, we should assume he did. As the district court recognized, such statements “could\nindicate a ‘sadistic’ or ‘malicious’ state of mind at the time of the physical encounter.” See\nWilson v. Seiter, 501 U.S. 294, 302 (1991).\n\n        The majority concludes that “[m]ost importantly, the video establishes that Griffin\nwas clearly struggling against both Hardrick and Rutledge before Hardrick employed the\nleg-sweep maneuver.” I do not agree that the video shows that Griffin was struggling with\nthe officers to an extent that no reasonable juror could conclude that Hardrick acted\nwantonly and maliciously in performing the takedown. The video does show that Griffin\nbegan walking away from Hardrick, and that she resisted his initial attempt to grab her arm.\nGriffin, however, contends that she did so because her arms were already sore and bruised,\nand that Hardrick’s grip caused her additional pain. Indeed, Hardrick concedes that Griffin\ntold him to “watch [her] arms.”\n\n        The video is ambiguous, however, as to whether Griffin was continuing to struggle\nat the time of the takedown and, even if she was, whether Hardrick could plausibly have\nthought a takedown necessary under the circumstances. In the approximately eight second\nspan from when Rutledge took hold of Griffin’s other arm until Hardrick performed the\ntakedown maneuver, Griffin can be seen continuing to talk with the two officers with no\naggressive physical movement. Hardrick and Rutledge then pull her forward forcefully,\nsufficient to make her stumble. It appears that Griffin has almost regained her balance when\nHardrick performs the takedown, and she continues to be restrained at both arms by the\nofficers. Further, no other inmates were in the area, and a third corrections officer stood\nnearby observing and ready to intervene. See Seiter, 501 U.S. at 303 (whether conduct “can\nbe characterized as ‘wanton’ depends upon the constraints facing the official”) (emphasis in\noriginal).\n\n        To be sure, prison officials are entitled to “wide-ranging deference in the adoption\nand execution of policies and practices that in their judgment are needed to preserve internal\norder.” Whitley v. Albers, 475 U.S. 312, 321-22 (1986). But such deference “does not\ninsulate from review actions taken in bad faith and for no legitimate purpose.” Id. at 322.\nA jury viewing the events portrayed in the video in light of the statements Griffin attributes\n\fNo. 09-5757          Griffin v. Hardrick                                                Page 13\n\n\nto Hardrick could reasonably conclude that Hardrick could not plausibly have thought that\nthe use of the takedown maneuver, although executed properly, was necessary, and that, in\nfact, he performed it solely to inflict pain, even if not of the degree that ultimately occurred.\n\f",

Oliver, Metropolitan <span class=\"star-pagination\">*951</span> Nashville Department of Law, Nashville, Tennessee, for Appellee.</p>\n<p>Before: COLE, GILMAN, and WHITE, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>GILMAN, J., delivered the opinion of the court, in which COLE, J., joined. WHITE, J. (pp. 957-58), delivered a separate dissenting opinion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>OPINION</h2>\n<p>RONALD LEE GILMAN, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>Trudy Griffin was brought to the Davidson County Criminal Justice Center after she was arrested for disorderly conduct. When Griffin created a disturbance while speaking with a nurse at the Center, two corrections officers, Darrell Hardrick and Pamela Rutledge, each took one of her arms and attempted to guide Griffin away from the nurse's station. Griffin at that point began struggling with the officers, causing Hardrick to perform a \"leg-sweep maneuver\" to bring Griffin to the floor so that she could be handcuffed and taken back to her holding cell. As Griffin fell to the floor, however, Rutledge tumbled with her. Rutledge accidentally landed on one of Griffin's legs, breaking Griffin's tibia.</p>\n<p>Griffin sued Hardrick over the incident, alleging an excessive-force claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 as well as a state-law claim for battery. The district court granted Hardrick's motion for summary judgment, holding that no reasonable jury could find that Hardrick had intended the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain when he tripped Griffin. For the reasons set forth below, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Factual background</h2>\n<p>Griffin was arrested on August 20, 2005 for disorderly conduct and resisting arrest. She was transported to the Davidson County Criminal Justice Center (Center) for booking. While she was in a holding cell at the Center, Griffin asked permission to go to the nurse's station. After permission was granted, she walked down the hall to speak with a nurse about bruises on her back and arms. Griffin repeatedly demanded that she be transported to a local hospital so that she could be treated for these injuries. When the nurse told Griffin that she would not be taken to a hospital, Griffin refused to take \"no\" for an answer and began raising her voice with the nurse. At this point, Hardrick, a corrections officer with the Davidson County Sheriff's Office who was in charge of the booking area, approached Griffin.</p>\n<p>Both parties agree that \"Hardrick observed [Griffin] acting in a non-compliant manner with regard to the instructions she received from the nurse,\" and that Griffin \"walked away from Hardrick when he attempted to speak with her about the situation.\" Griffin claims that as she walked away, Hardrick threatened her by saying that \"she was going to live in his hell\" and that she \"was his bitch.\" Hardrick then took hold of one of Griffin's arms, but Griffin attempted to pull away. Griffin claims that she told Hardrick to \"watch her arms\" because they were sore from being bruised earlier.</p>\n<p>At that point, Hardrick asked Rutledge, another corrections officer at the Center, to assist with the situation. When Rutledge reached for Griffin's other arm, Griffin pulled her arm away (although she contends that she pulled away only \"a little bit\"). Hardrick and Rutledge then began leading Griffin down the hall toward her holding cell. Griffin claims that she was not struggling, resisting, or acting aggressively. She asserts that Hardrick nevertheless suddenly tripped her, causing her to fall to the floor. This in turn caused Rutledge to accidentally fall on top of her, which fractured Griffin's tibia.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*952</span> Hardrick, on the other hand, contends that Griffin was jerking and attempting to get away. This prompted him to perform a \"leg-sweep maneuver,\" typically used by officers to bring a noncompliant individual to the ground with the least amount of force necessary. He does not dispute, however, that Rutledge accidentally fell on Griffin's leg as a result of the leg sweep. After Griffin was handcuffed on the ground, other Center employees carried her into the holding-cell area. An ambulance was then called to the Center for the purpose of taking Griffin to the hospital, where she required surgery, eight screws, and a metal plate to fix her broken tibia.</p>\n<p>A security camera caught the incident on videotape. The video establishes that Griffin approached the nurse's station and remained there for just under 10 minutes, alternating between standing at the window and sitting in a chair placed by the station. She can be seen motioning and waiving her arms at various points throughout her conversation with the nurse. Hardrick walked toward Griffin and spoke with her for approximately 20 seconds before Rutledge approached the nurse's station and stood a few feet away from Hardrick and Griffin.</p>\n<p>After another 10 seconds, Griffin began to walk away from Hardrick, who then reached out to take her right arm. Griffin attempted to jerk her arm away, but Hardrick maintained his grip, and Rutledge stepped in to take Griffin's left arm. After a second or two of struggling with Griffin outside the nurse's station, Hardrick and Rutledge began to escort her down the hallway, which she resisted. Hardrick then stuck out his leg to trip Griffin. At this point, Griffin fell to the floor, and Rutledge tumbled on top of her.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Procedural history</h2>\n<p>In May 2006, Griffin filed a lawsuit in a Tennessee state court against Hardrick and the Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County (Metro), alleging a claim of battery under the Tennessee Governmental Tort Liability Act. <i>See</i> Tenn.Code Ann. §§ 29-20-101 to -408. Griffin later dismissed her claim against Metro, but added an excessive-force claim against Hardrick pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Section 1983 provides a cause of action against those who violate a person's constitutional rights while acting under color of state law. This caused Hardrick to timely remove the case to the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee.</p>\n<p>Hardrick subsequently moved for summary judgment. In response to Griffin's § 1983 claim, he argued that not only was he entitled to qualified immunity, but that Griffin's claim could not succeed on the merits because Hardrick's use of force did not constitute the wanton infliction of pain. Hardrick further contended that he used only the amount of force necessary to subdue Griffin, so that her battery claim was likewise without merit.</p>\n<p>The district court granted Hardrick's motion for summary judgment in June 2009. Because the court concluded that no reasonable jury could find that Hardrick's conduct constituted the wanton infliction of pain, it did not address Hardrick's qualified-immunity argument. The court also decided that where the identical use of force leads to both a § 1983 claim and a state-law battery claim, the same standard applies to both causes of action. It therefore granted summary judgment to Hardrick on Griffin's state-law battery claim as well. Griffin has timely appealed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. ANALYSIS</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Standard of review</h2>\n<p>We review de novo a district court's grant of summary judgment. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*953</span> <i>ACLU of Ky. v. Grayson County,</i> 591 F.3d 837, 843 (6th Cir.2010). Summary judgment is proper where no genuine issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c)(2). In considering a motion for summary judgment, the district court must draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party. <i>Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp.,</i> 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986). The central issue is \"whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so one-sided that one party must prevail as a matter of law.\" <i>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc.,</i> 477 U.S. 242, 251-52, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Griffin's § 1983 claim</h2>\n<p>Section 1983 prohibits a person \"acting under color of state law\" from depriving an individual \"of a right secured by the Federal Constitution or laws of the United States.\" <i>Wolotsky v. Huhn,</i> 960 F.2d 1331, 1335 (6th Cir.1992). Griffin's complaint alleged that Hardrick violated § 1983 by using excessive force against her in violation of the <i>Fourth</i> Amendment. The district court, however, interpreted her claim as alleging a violation of the <i>Fourteenth</i> Amendment, and Griffin does not dispute this characterization on appeal.</p>\n<p>Prisoners are protected from the use of excessive force by the Eighth Amendment. <i>Whitley v. Albers,</i> 475 U.S. 312, 327, 106 S.Ct. 1078, 89 L.Ed.2d 251 (1986). As a pretrial detainee, however, Griffin's rights stem from the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which \"protects a pretrial detainee from the use of excessive force that amounts to punishment.\" <i>Graham v. Connor,</i> 490 U.S. 386, 395 n. 10, 109 S.Ct. 1865, 104 L.Ed.2d 443 (1989). The law is unsettled as to whether the analysis for a Fourteenth Amendment excessive-force claim and an Eighth Amendment excessive-force claim is the same. <i>See </i><i>Leary v. Livingston County,</i> 528 F.3d 438, 443 (6th Cir. 2008) (\"[T]here is room for debate over whether the Due Process Clause grants pretrial detainees more protections than the Eighth Amendment does....\"). <i>Compare </i><i>Orem v. Rephann,</i> 523 F.3d 442, 446 (4th Cir.2008) (applying the Eighth Amendment standard to a pretrial detainee's excessive-force claim under the Fourteenth Amendment), <i>with </i><i>Wilson v. Williams,</i> 83 F.3d 870, 875 (7th Cir.1996) (\"Since [the protection of the Fourteenth Amendment] extends beyond the prohibition of merely `cruel and unusual' punishment, pretrial detainees must arguably be afforded a higher standard than that provided by the Eighth Amendment.\").</p>\n<p>In the instant case, however, both parties and the district court relied on this court's unpublished decision in <i>Watkins v. Evans,</i> Nos. 95-4162, 95-4341, 1996 WL 499094, at *2 (6th Cir. Sept.3, 1996), which held that the standards are the same. Because Griffin does not seek to invoke the potentially broader protections of the Fourteenth Amendment, we will analyze her claim under the Eighth Amendment standard. <i>See </i><i>Lewis v. Downey,</i> 581 F.3d 467, 475 (7th Cir.2009) (analyzing a pretrial detainee's excessive-force claim under the same standard as an Eighth Amendment excessive-force claim where the detainee did not seek to invoke \"any safeguards the Fourteenth Amendment provides beyond those it shares with the Eighth Amendment\").</p>\n<p>The test for whether the use of force violates the Eighth Amendment requires a court to determine if the defendant's conduct caused the \"unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain.\" <i>Moore v. Holbrook,</i> 2 F.3d 697, 700 (6th Cir.1993) (citation omitted). In other words,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*954</span> [t]o ascertain whether excessive force was used under the Eighth Amendment, the court must determine whether the force was applied in a good-faith effort to maintain or restore discipline, or maliciously and sadistically to cause harm. Such a claim has both an objective and a subjective component. The objective component requires that the pain be serious. The subjective component requires that the offending, non-penal conduct be wanton.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Watkins,</i> 1996 WL 499094, at *2 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p>Hardrick does not dispute that Griffin suffered serious pain, so the objective element is satisfied. We must therefore determine if a genuine issue exists as to whether Hardrick's conduct in using the leg-sweep maneuver on Griffin was \"applied in a good-faith effort to maintain or restore discipline, or maliciously and sadistically to cause harm.\" <i>See id.</i></p>\n<p>As an initial matter, Griffin argues that the district court erred in considering the videotape when ruling on Hardrick's motion for summary judgment. The Supreme Court, however, has held that a court may properly consider videotape evidence at the summary-judgment stage. \"When opposing parties tell two different stories, one of which is blatantly contradicted by the record, so that no reasonable jury could believe it, a court should not adopt that version of the facts for purposes of ruling on a motion for summary judgment.\" <i>Scott v. Harris,</i> 550 U.S. 372, 380, 127 S.Ct. 1769, 167 L.Ed.2d 686 (2007) (holding that, based on videotape evidence, a police officer did not use excessive force in ramming a fleeing suspect's car). Moreover, the reasonableness of a defendant's actions is an appropriate matter to determine on summary judgment. <i>Dunn v. Matatall,</i> 549 F.3d 348, 353 (6th Cir.2008) (explaining that <i>Scott</i> \"instructs us to determine as a matter of law whether the events depicted on [a] video, taken in the light most favorable to [the nonmoving party], show that the Officers' conduct was objectively reasonable\"). The district court thus properly considered the videotape evidence in determining whether Hardrick's actions were wanton.</p>\n<p>Turning now to whether Hardrick's use of force was excessive, this court has previously cautioned that an official's decision to use force is entitled to deference:</p>\n<blockquote>[O]fficials confronted with a prison disturbance must balance the threat [that] unrest poses to inmates, prison workers, administrators, and visitors against the harm inmates may suffer if guards use force. Because prison officials must make their decisions in haste, under pressure, and frequently without the luxury of a second chance, we must grant them wide-ranging deference in the adoption and execution of policies and practices that in their judgment are needed to preserve internal order and discipline and to maintain institutional security.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Combs v. Wilkinson,</i> 315 F.3d 548, 557 (6th Cir.2002) (first alteration in original) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). The issue is therefore not whether the use of force was absolutely necessary in hindsight, but \"whether the use of force could plausibly have been thought necessary, or instead evinced such wantonness with respect to the unjustified infliction of harm as is tantamount to a knowing willingness that it occur.\" <i>Whitley,</i> 475 U.S. at 321, 106 S.Ct. 1078.</p>\n<p>Griffin does not dispute that she was acting in a noncompliant manner toward the nurse, that she walked away from Hardrick while he was speaking with her, and that she attempted to jerk her arm away from Hardrick. As is evident from the video, Hardrick was calm and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*955</span> nonaggressive during his initial conversation with Griffin. He stood at least a foot away from Griffin and spoke with her for about 30 seconds before ever touching her. Most importantly, the video establishes that Griffin was clearly struggling against both Hardrick and Rutledge before Hardrick employed the leg-sweep maneuver.</p>\n<p>The fact that Griffin had been engaged in a loud, lengthy, and animated conversation with the nurse gave Hardrick a reasonable basis to believe that force would be necessary to control Griffin. Similarly, Griffin was struggling against Hardrick and Rutledge as they attempted to lead her away from the nurse's station, giving Hardrick a plausible reason to believe that force was necessary to bring Griffin to the floor so that she could be handcuffed and taken back to her holding cell. Hardrick's initial calm demeanor with Griffin suggests that he was not seeking to wantonly inflict pain on her, but was attempting to bring her under control.</p>\n<p>Griffin does not dispute that Hardrick was in compliance with all relevant Center policies on the use of force, and she does not dispute Hardrick's contention that he was acting according to his training when employing the leg-sweep maneuver. Indeed, to counter the fact that Hardrick was responding to the situation as trained, Griffin argues only that the opinion of the subject-control instructor for the Davidson County Sheriff's Officethat the legsweep maneuver was proper under the circumstanceswas <i>based on the video,</i> which testimony she claims would invade the province of the jury and should therefore have been excluded from consideration on summary judgment.</p>\n<p>But as discussed above, a court may properly consider videotape evidence at the summary-judgment stage, <i>Scott,</i> 550 U.S. at 380-81, 127 S.Ct. 1769, so an expert opinion based on such evidence is appropriate, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Evid. 702; <i>Brainard v. Am. Skandia Life Assurance Corp.,</i> 432 F.3d 655, 663 (6th Cir.2005) (holding that an expert opinion is permitted at the summary judgment stage so long as the opinion is not \"a conclusory assertion about ultimate legal issues\" (citation omitted)). The fact that Hardrick was acting according to established procedures suggests that he had not undertaken the leg-sweep maneuver in a wanton manner, but was acting as he was trained while attempting to gain control of Griffin. Moreover, there is no basis whatsoever to infer that Hardrick intended to use such force as would break Griffin's leg. The force that did so came solely from the unfortunate accident of Rutledge collapsing on Griffin as they both fell to the floor. These circumstances do not support a § 1983 claim for the wanton infliction of pain on the part of Hardrick.</p>\n<p>In response to the adverse ruling by the district court, Griffin argues that she presented several genuine issues of material fact sufficient to defeat Hardrick's motion for summary judgment. Griffin, for example, contends that \"Hardrick never denied that Griffin received injuries to her arms before coming into the [Center],\" and that he \"never denied that he made threats towards Griffin that `she was going to live in his hell' and that she `was his bitch.'\" But these alleged threats do not create a genuine issue of <i>material</i> fact under the particular circumstances here because the videotape shows that Griffin was still struggling with the officers at the time Hardrick employed the leg-sweep maneuver. So at that moment, Hardrick had a reasonable basis to believe that further force was necessary to control Griffin, even if he had earlier made the alleged generalized threats against her.</p>\n<p>Griffin next argues that she was walking away because she was scared of Hardrick and wanted to return to her holding cell, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*956</span> thus creating a genuine issue of material fact. But this allegation is not material even if it is true (which seems doubtful given Hardrick's calm demeanor as shown on the videotape when he initially interacted with Griffin). Whether or not she felt that she had a good reason for walking away, Griffin was still noncompliant with the nurse and was resisting Hardrick and Rutledge before Hardrick used the legsweep maneuver. Moreover, Griffin has never contended that she communicated her alleged motivation to Hardrick, so her reason for noncompliance is irrelevant as to whether Hardrick reasonably thought that force was necessary to bring Griffin under control.</p>\n<p>Other issues cited by Griffin are clearly contradicted by the record. She claims that Hardrick tripped her without provocation and that at no time did she resist either Hardrick or Rutledge. To the contrary, the video clearly shows Griffin resisting the officers' efforts to lead her down the hallway and her efforts to break away from them.</p>\n<p>The district court thus did not err in granting Hardrick's motion for summary judgment on Griffin's § 1983 excessive-force claim. Although we consider this to be a close case, we ultimately conclude that no reasonable jury could find that Hardrick \"evinced such wantonness ... as is tantamount to a knowing willingness\" that Griffin's injury occur. <i>See </i><i>Whitley v. Albers,</i> 475 U.S. 312, 321, 106 S.Ct. 1078, 89 L.Ed.2d 251 (1986). We therefore need not decide the merits of Hardrick's argument that he is entitled to qualified immunity.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. Griffin's state-law battery claim</h2>\n<p>In addition to her § 1983 claim, Griffin alleged a state-law battery claim against Hardrick. Griffin brought this claim under the Tennessee Governmental Tort Liability Act, which permits individuals to bring a cause of action against governmental employees who allegedly commit intentional torts. <i>See </i><i>Baines v. Wilson County,</i> 86 S.W.3d 575, 583 n. 5 (Tenn.Ct.App.2002). Griffin's appellate brief, however, does not mention her battery claim. Indeed, her Statement of the Case references only an excessive-force violation against Hardrick pursuant to § 1983. Nor was her battery claim mentioned at oral argument. She has therefore likely abandoned this claim on appeal. <i>See </i><i>Marks v. Newcourt Credit Group, Inc.,</i> 342 F.3d 444, 462 (6th Cir. 2003) (\"An appellant waives an issue when he fails to present it in his initial briefs before this court.\"). <i>But see </i><i>Madden v. Chattanooga City Wide Serv. Dep't,</i> 549 F.3d 666, 673 (6th Cir.2008) (holding that where the same analysis applies to a plaintiff's federal and state-law causes of action, a defendant does not waive its defense to the state-law claim by failing to present the state-law claim on appeal if it argued the federal claim).</p>\n<p>But even if Griffin has not abandoned this claim, it fails on the merits. Where a plaintiff asserts a battery claim under Tennessee law that arises out of the same use of force as her § 1983 excessive-force claim, the analysis is the same for both causes of action. That is, \"whether the analysis concerns whether an officer violated a plaintiff's constitutional rights by using excessive force or whether the analysis concerns whether an officer committed state-law battery by using force that was `clearly excessive,' the same principles... are applied.\" <i>Lee v. Metro. Gov't of Nashville &amp; Davidson County,</i> 596 F.Supp.2d 1101, 1118 (M.D.Tenn.2009) (holding that officers entitled to summary judgment on a § 1983 excessive-force claim were automatically entitled to summary judgment on the Tennessee common-law battery claim); <i>see also Harris v. Metro.</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*957</span> <i>Gov't of Nashville,</i> No. 3:06-0868, 2007 WL 4481176, at *9 (M.D.Tenn. Dec.18, 2007) (\"[T]he plaintiff has set forth adequate grounds for his [§ 1983] claim of excessive force against each of the officers. Because Tennessee courts apply the same `excessive force' principles to assault and battery claims against police officers, the plaintiff has additionally set forth adequate grounds against each of the officers for assault and battery under Tennessee law.\"). We thus find no error in the district court's conclusion that because Hardrick was entitled to summary judgment on Griffin's § 1983 claim, he was also entitled to summary judgment on her state-law battery claim.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>For all of the reasons set forth above, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p>HELENE N. WHITE, Circuit Judge (dissenting).</p>\n<p>I respectfully dissent. I agree that it is appropriate for the court to consider a video of the events when ruling on a motion for summary judgment, and to discount any allegations clearly rebutted by the video. I do not, however, agree that the video in this case clearly undermines Griffin's account leaving no genuine issue of material fact. I would reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p>In my view, the videotape does not \"blatantly contradict[]\" Griffin's version of the facts \"so that no reasonable jury could believe\" her, and therefore summary judgment was not appropriate. <i>Scott v. Harris,</i> 550 U.S. 372, 380-81, 127 S.Ct. 1769, 167 L.Ed.2d 686 (2007). Under <i>Scott,</i> in determining whether there are material factual disputes, we must accept the facts as depicted in the video, even when contrary to a party's sworn testimony. However, facts that are not clearly portrayed in the video remain entitled to an interpretation most favorable to the non-moving party. <i>Morales v. American Honda Motor Co., Inc.,</i> 71 F.3d 531, 535 (6th Cir. 1995); <i>see </i><i>Scott,</i> 550 U.S. at 380, 127 S.Ct. 1769 (facts must be viewed in a light most favorable to non-moving party when there is a \"genuine dispute as to those facts\"). Accepting all events portrayed in the video as true, there remains a material factual dispute as to whether Hardrick performed the takedown maneuver maliciously and sadistically to cause harm, rather than \"in a good-faith effort to maintain or restore discipline.\" <i>Hudson v. McMillian,</i> 503 U.S. 1, 6, 112 S.Ct. 995, 117 L.Ed.2d 156 (1992).</p>\n<p>In <i>Scott,</i> the Court found that the plaintiff's claim that he was driving in a \"cautious and controlled\" fashion was clearly rebutted by the video that showed him traveling upwards of 85 miles per hour on narrow roads, swerving around cars, crossing the double-yellow line, forcing other cars traveling in both directions to the side of the road, running multiple red lights, and driving in the left-turn-only lane. <i>Id.</i> at 379-80, 127 S.Ct. 1769. The video here, however, does not definitively establish either what transpired prior to Hardrick executing the takedown maneuver, or that Hardrick did not act maliciously or wantonly in executing the maneuver.</p>\n<p>Griffin contends that Hardrick told her \"she was going to live in hell\" and that she \"was his bitch.\" The video, which has no accompanying audio, does not contradict this allegation. The district court's perception of the \"calmness\" of Hardrick's demeanor is not incompatible with his having made these statements to Griffin, and thus, at this point in the litigation, we should assume he did. As the district court recognized, such statements \"could indicate a `sadistic' or `malicious' state of mind at the time of the physical encounter.\" <i>See </i><i>Wilson v. Seiter,</i> 501 U.S. 294, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*958</span> 302, 111 S.Ct. 2321, 115 L.Ed.2d 271 (1991).</p>\n<p>The majority concludes that \"[m]ost importantly, the video establishes that Griffin was clearly struggling against both Hardrick and Rutledge before Hardrick employed the leg-sweep maneuver.\" I do not agree that the video shows that Griffin was struggling with the officers to an extent that no reasonable juror could conclude that Hardrick acted wantonly and maliciously in performing the takedown. The video does show that Griffin began walking away from Hardrick, and that she resisted his initial attempt to grab her arm. Griffin, however, contends that she did so because her arms were already sore and bruised, and that Hardrick's grip caused her additional pain. Indeed, Hardrick concedes that Griffin told him to \"watch [her] arms.\"</p>\n<p>The video is ambiguous, however, as to whether Griffin was continuing to struggle at the time of the takedown and, even if she was, whether Hardrick could plausibly have thought a takedown necessary under the circumstances. In the approximately eight second span from when Rutledge took hold of Griffin's other arm until Hardrick performed the takedown maneuver, Griffin can be seen continuing to talk with the two officers with no aggressive physical movement. Hardrick and Rutledge then pull her forward forcefully, sufficient to make her stumble. It appears that Griffin has almost regained her balance when Hardrick performs the takedown, and she continues to be restrained at both arms by the officers. Further, no other inmates were in the area, and a third corrections officer stood nearby observing and ready to intervene. <i>See </i><i>Seiter,</i> 501 U.S. at 303, 111 S.Ct. 2321 (whether conduct \"can be characterized as `wanton' depends upon the constraints facing the <i>official</i>\") (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p>To be sure, prison officials are entitled to \"wide-ranging deference in the adoption and execution of policies and practices that in their judgment are needed to preserve internal order.\" <i>Whitley v. Albers,</i> 475 U.S. 312, 321-22, 106 S.Ct. 1078, 89 L.Ed.2d 251 (1986). But such deference \"does not insulate from review actions taken in bad faith and for no legitimate purpose.\" <i>Id.</i> at 322, 106 S.Ct. 1078. A jury viewing the events portrayed in the video in light of the statements Griffin attributes to Hardrick could reasonably conclude that Hardrick could not plausibly have thought that the use of the takedown maneuver, although executed properly, was necessary, and that, in fact, he performed it solely to inflict pain, even if not of the degree that ultimately occurred.</p>\n</div>",

WHITE, J. (pp. 957-58), delivered a separate dissenting opinion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>OPINION</h2>\n<p>RONALD LEE GILMAN, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>Trudy Griffin was brought to the Davidson County Criminal Justice Center after she was arrested for disorderly conduct. When Griffin created a disturbance while speaking with a nurse at the Center, two corrections officers, Darrell Hardrick and Pamela Rutledge, each took one of her arms and attempted to guide Griffin away from the nurse's station. Griffin at that point began struggling with the officers, causing Hardrick to perform a \"leg-sweep maneuver\" to bring Griffin to the floor so that she could be handcuffed and taken back to her holding cell. As Griffin fell to the floor, however, Rutledge tumbled with her. Rutledge accidentally landed on one of Griffin's legs, breaking Griffin's tibia.</p>\n<p>Griffin sued Hardrick over the incident, alleging an excessive-force claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 as well as a state-law claim for battery. The district court granted Hardrick's motion for summary judgment, holding that no reasonable jury could find that Hardrick had intended the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain when he tripped Griffin. For the reasons set forth below, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Factual background</h2>\n<p>Griffin was arrested on August 20, 2005 for disorderly conduct and resisting arrest. She was transported to the Davidson County Criminal Justice Center (Center) for booking. While she was in a holding cell at the Center, Griffin asked permission to go to the nurse's station. After permission was granted, she walked down the hall to speak with a nurse about bruises on her back and arms. Griffin repeatedly demanded that she be transported to a local hospital so that she could be treated for these injuries. When the nurse told Griffin that she would not be taken to a hospital, Griffin refused to take \"no\" for an answer and began raising her voice with the nurse. At this point, Hardrick, a corrections officer with the Davidson County Sheriff's Office who was in charge of the booking area, approached Griffin.</p>\n<p>Both parties agree that \"Hardrick observed [Griffin] acting in a non-compliant manner with regard to the instructions she received from the nurse,\" and that Griffin \"walked away from Hardrick when he attempted to speak with her about the situation.\" Griffin claims that as she walked away, Hardrick threatened her by saying that \"she was going to live in his hell\" and that she \"was his bitch.\" Hardrick then took hold of one of Griffin's arms, but Griffin attempted to pull away. Griffin claims that she told Hardrick to \"watch her arms\" because they were sore from being bruised earlier.</p>\n<p>At that point, Hardrick asked Rutledge, another corrections officer at the Center, to assist with the situation. When Rutledge reached for Griffin's other arm, Griffin pulled her arm away (although she contends that she pulled away only \"a little bit\"). Hardrick and Rutledge then began leading Griffin down the hall toward her holding cell. Griffin claims that she was not struggling, resisting, or acting aggressively. She asserts that Hardrick nevertheless suddenly tripped her, causing her to fall to the floor. This in turn caused Rutledge to accidentally fall on top of her, which fractured Griffin's tibia.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*952</span> Hardrick, on the other hand, contends that Griffin was jerking and attempting to get away. This prompted him to perform a \"leg-sweep maneuver,\" typically used by officers to bring a noncompliant individual to the ground with the least amount of force necessary. He does not dispute, however, that Rutledge accidentally fell on Griffin's leg as a result of the leg sweep. After Griffin was handcuffed on the ground, other Center employees carried her into the holding-cell area. An ambulance was then called to the Center for the purpose of taking Griffin to the hospital, where she required surgery, eight screws, and a metal plate to fix her broken tibia.</p>\n<p>A security camera caught the incident on videotape. The video establishes that Griffin approached the nurse's station and remained there for just under 10 minutes, alternating between standing at the window and sitting in a chair placed by the station. She can be seen motioning and waiving her arms at various points throughout her conversation with the nurse. Hardrick walked toward Griffin and spoke with her for approximately 20 seconds before Rutledge approached the nurse's station and stood a few feet away from Hardrick and Griffin.</p>\n<p>After another 10 seconds, Griffin began to walk away from Hardrick, who then reached out to take her right arm. Griffin attempted to jerk her arm away, but Hardrick maintained his grip, and Rutledge stepped in to take Griffin's left arm. After a second or two of struggling with Griffin outside the nurse's station, Hardrick and Rutledge began to escort her down the hallway, which she resisted. Hardrick then stuck out his leg to trip Griffin. At this point, Griffin fell to the floor, and Rutledge tumbled on top of her.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Procedural history</h2>\n<p>In May 2006, Griffin filed a lawsuit in a Tennessee state court against Hardrick and the Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County (Metro), alleging a claim of battery under the Tennessee Governmental Tort Liability Act. <i>See</i> Tenn.Code Ann. §§ 29-20-101 to -408. Griffin later dismissed her claim against Metro, but added an excessive-force claim against Hardrick pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Section 1983 provides a cause of action against those who violate a person's constitutional rights while acting under color of state law. This caused Hardrick to timely remove the case to the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee.</p>\n<p>Hardrick subsequently moved for summary judgment. In response to Griffin's § 1983 claim, he argued that not only was he entitled to qualified immunity, but that Griffin's claim could not succeed on the merits because Hardrick's use of force did not constitute the wanton infliction of pain. Hardrick further contended that he used only the amount of force necessary to subdue Griffin, so that her battery claim was likewise without merit.</p>\n<p>The district court granted Hardrick's motion for summary judgment in June 2009. Because the court concluded that no reasonable jury could find that Hardrick's conduct constituted the wanton infliction of pain, it did not address Hardrick's qualified-immunity argument. The court also decided that where the identical use of force leads to both a § 1983 claim and a state-law battery claim, the same standard applies to both causes of action. It therefore granted summary judgment to Hardrick on Griffin's state-law battery claim as well. Griffin has timely appealed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. ANALYSIS</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A.

Summary judgment is proper where no genuine issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c)(2). In considering a motion for summary judgment, the district court must draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party. <i>Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v.

Griffin's § 1983 claim</h2>\n<p>Section 1983 prohibits a person \"acting under color of state law\" from depriving an individual \"of a right secured by the Federal Constitution or laws of the United States.\" <i>Wolotsky v.

Griffin's complaint alleged that Hardrick violated § 1983 by using excessive force against her in violation of the <i>Fourth</i> Amendment. The district court, however, interpreted her claim as alleging a violation of the <i>Fourteenth</i> Amendment, and Griffin does not dispute this characterization on appeal.</p>\n<p>Prisoners are protected from the use of excessive force by the Eighth Amendment. <i>Whitley v.

As a pretrial detainee, however, Griffin's rights stem from the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which \"protects a pretrial detainee from the use of excessive force that amounts to punishment.\" <i>Graham v.

Sept.3, 1996), which held that the standards are the same. Because Griffin does not seek to invoke the potentially broader protections of the Fourteenth Amendment, we will analyze her claim under the Eighth Amendment standard. <i>See </i><i>Lewis v. Downey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1264804\"><a href=\"/opinion/1264804/lewis-v-downey/\"><span class=\"volume\">581</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">467</span></a></span>, 475 (7th Cir.2009) (analyzing a pretrial detainee's excessive-force claim under the same standard as an Eighth Amendment excessive-force claim where the detainee did not seek to invoke \"any safeguards the Fourteenth Amendment provides beyond those it shares with the Eighth Amendment\").</p>\n<p>The test for whether the use of force violates the Eighth Amendment requires a court to determine if the defendant's conduct caused the \"unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain.\" <i>Moore v.

In other words,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*954</span> [t]o ascertain whether excessive force was used under the Eighth Amendment, the court must determine whether the force was applied in a good-faith effort to maintain or restore discipline, or maliciously and sadistically to cause harm. Such a claim has both an objective and a subjective component. The objective component requires that the pain be serious. The subjective component requires that the offending, non-penal conduct be wanton.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Watkins,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">499094</span></span>, at *2 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p>Hardrick does not dispute that Griffin suffered serious pain, so the objective element is satisfied. We must therefore determine if a genuine issue exists as to whether Hardrick's conduct in using the leg-sweep maneuver on Griffin was \"applied in a good-faith effort to maintain or restore discipline, or maliciously and sadistically to cause harm.\" <i>See id.</i></p>\n<p>As an initial matter, Griffin argues that the district court erred in considering the videotape when ruling on Hardrick's motion for summary judgment. The Supreme Court, however, has held that a court may properly consider videotape evidence at the summary-judgment stage. \"When opposing parties tell two different stories, one of which is blatantly contradicted by the record, so that no reasonable jury could believe it, a court should not adopt that version of the facts for purposes of ruling on a motion for summary judgment.\" <i>Scott v.

Moreover, the reasonableness of a defendant's actions is an appropriate matter to determine on summary judgment. <i>Dunn v. Matatall,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1351810\"><a href=\"/opinion/1351810/dunn-v-matatall/\"><span class=\"volume\">549</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">348</span></a></span>, 353 (6th Cir.2008) (explaining that <i>Scott</i> \"instructs us to determine as a matter of law whether the events depicted on [a] video, taken in the light most favorable to [the nonmoving party], show that the Officers' conduct was objectively reasonable\"). The district court thus properly considered the videotape evidence in determining whether Hardrick's actions were wanton.</p>\n<p>Turning now to whether Hardrick's use of force was excessive, this court has previously cautioned that an official's decision to use force is entitled to deference:</p>\n<blockquote>[O]fficials confronted with a prison disturbance must balance the threat [that] unrest poses to inmates, prison workers, administrators, and visitors against the harm inmates may suffer if guards use force. Because prison officials must make their decisions in haste, under pressure, and frequently without the luxury of a second chance, we must grant them wide-ranging deference in the adoption and execution of policies and practices that in their judgment are needed to preserve internal order and discipline and to maintain institutional security.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Combs v.

The issue is therefore not whether the use of force was absolutely necessary in hindsight, but \"whether the use of force could plausibly have been thought necessary, or instead evinced such wantonness with respect to the unjustified infliction of harm as is tantamount to a knowing willingness that it occur.\" <i>Whitley,</i> 475 U.S. at 321, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111610\"><a href=\"/opinion/111610/whitley-v-albers/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1078</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>Griffin does not dispute that she was acting in a noncompliant manner toward the nurse, that she walked away from Hardrick while he was speaking with her, and that she attempted to jerk her arm away from Hardrick. As is evident from the video, Hardrick was calm and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*955</span> nonaggressive during his initial conversation with Griffin. He stood at least a foot away from Griffin and spoke with her for about 30 seconds before ever touching her. Most importantly, the video establishes that Griffin was clearly struggling against both Hardrick and Rutledge before Hardrick employed the leg-sweep maneuver.</p>\n<p>The fact that Griffin had been engaged in a loud, lengthy, and animated conversation with the nurse gave Hardrick a reasonable basis to believe that force would be necessary to control Griffin. Similarly, Griffin was struggling against Hardrick and Rutledge as they attempted to lead her away from the nurse's station, giving Hardrick a plausible reason to believe that force was necessary to bring Griffin to the floor so that she could be handcuffed and taken back to her holding cell. Hardrick's initial calm demeanor with Griffin suggests that he was not seeking to wantonly inflict pain on her, but was attempting to bring her under control.</p>\n<p>Griffin does not dispute that Hardrick was in compliance with all relevant Center policies on the use of force, and she does not dispute Hardrick's contention that he was acting according to his training when employing the leg-sweep maneuver. Indeed, to counter the fact that Hardrick was responding to the situation as trained, Griffin argues only that the opinion of the subject-control instructor for the Davidson County Sheriff's Officethat the legsweep maneuver was proper under the circumstanceswas <i>based on the video,</i> which testimony she claims would invade the province of the jury and should therefore have been excluded from consideration on summary judgment.</p>\n<p>But as discussed above, a court may properly consider videotape evidence at the summary-judgment stage, <i>Scott,</i> 550 U.S. at 380-81, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145738\"><a href=\"/opinion/145738/scott-v-harris/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1769</span></a></span>, so an expert opinion based on such evidence is appropriate, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Evid. 702; <i>Brainard v. Am. Skandia Life Assurance Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"792727\"><a href=\"/opinion/792727/timothy-brainard-v-american-skandia-life-assurance-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">432</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">655</span></a></span>, 663 (6th Cir.2005) (holding that an expert opinion is permitted at the summary judgment stage so long as the opinion is not \"a conclusory assertion about ultimate legal issues\" (citation omitted)). The fact that Hardrick was acting according to established procedures suggests that he had not undertaken the leg-sweep maneuver in a wanton manner, but was acting as he was trained while attempting to gain control of Griffin. Moreover, there is no basis whatsoever to infer that Hardrick intended to use such force as would break Griffin's leg. The force that did so came solely from the unfortunate accident of Rutledge collapsing on Griffin as they both fell to the floor. These circumstances do not support a § 1983 claim for the wanton infliction of pain on the part of Hardrick.</p>\n<p>In response to the adverse ruling by the district court, Griffin argues that she presented several genuine issues of material fact sufficient to defeat Hardrick's motion for summary judgment. Griffin, for example, contends that \"Hardrick never denied that Griffin received injuries to her arms before coming into the [Center],\" and that he \"never denied that he made threats towards Griffin that `she was going to live in his hell' and that she `was his bitch.'\" But these alleged threats do not create a genuine issue of <i>material</i> fact under the particular circumstances here because the videotape shows that Griffin was still struggling with the officers at the time Hardrick employed the leg-sweep maneuver. So at that moment, Hardrick had a reasonable basis to believe that further force was necessary to control Griffin, even if he had earlier made the alleged generalized threats against her.</p>\n<p>Griffin next argues that she was walking away because she was scared of Hardrick and wanted to return to her holding cell, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*956</span> thus creating a genuine issue of material fact. But this allegation is not material even if it is true (which seems doubtful given Hardrick's calm demeanor as shown on the videotape when he initially interacted with Griffin). Whether or not she felt that she had a good reason for walking away, Griffin was still noncompliant with the nurse and was resisting Hardrick and Rutledge before Hardrick used the legsweep maneuver. Moreover, Griffin has never contended that she communicated her alleged motivation to Hardrick, so her reason for noncompliance is irrelevant as to whether Hardrick reasonably thought that force was necessary to bring Griffin under control.</p>\n<p>Other issues cited by Griffin are clearly contradicted by the record. She claims that Hardrick tripped her without provocation and that at no time did she resist either Hardrick or Rutledge. To the contrary, the video clearly shows Griffin resisting the officers' efforts to lead her down the hallway and her efforts to break away from them.</p>\n<p>The district court thus did not err in granting Hardrick's motion for summary judgment on Griffin's § 1983 excessive-force claim. Although we consider this to be a close case, we ultimately conclude that no reasonable jury could find that Hardrick \"evinced such wantonness ... as is tantamount to a knowing willingness\" that Griffin's injury occur. <i>See </i><i>Whitley v. Albers,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111610\"><a href=\"/opinion/111610/whitley-v-albers/\"><span class=\"volume\">475</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">312</span></a></span>, 321, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111610\"><a href=\"/opinion/111610/whitley-v-albers/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">251</span></a></span> (1986). We therefore need not decide the merits of Hardrick's argument that he is entitled to qualified immunity.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. Griffin's state-law battery claim</h2>\n<p>In addition to her § 1983 claim, Griffin alleged a state-law battery claim against Hardrick. Griffin brought this claim under the Tennessee Governmental Tort Liability Act, which permits individuals to bring a cause of action against governmental employees who allegedly commit intentional torts. <i>See </i><i>Baines v. Wilson County,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2351965\"><a href=\"/opinion/2351965/baines-v-wilson-county/\"><span class=\"volume\">86</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">575</span></a></span>, 583 n. 5 (Tenn.Ct.App.2002). Griffin's appellate brief, however, does not mention her battery claim. Indeed, her Statement of the Case references only an excessive-force violation against Hardrick pursuant to § 1983. Nor was her battery claim mentioned at oral argument. She has therefore likely abandoned this claim on appeal. <i>See </i><i>Marks v. Newcourt Credit Group, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"783429\"><a href=\"/opinion/783429/lloyd-marks-v-newcourt-credit-group-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">342</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">444</span></a></span>, 462 (6th Cir. 2003) (\"An appellant waives an issue when he fails to present it in his initial briefs before this court.\"). <i>But see </i><i>Madden v. Chattanooga City Wide Serv. Dep't,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1352513\"><a href=\"/opinion/1352513/madden-v-chattanooga-city-wide-service-dept/\"><span class=\"volume\">549</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">666</span></a></span>, 673 (6th Cir.2008) (holding that where the same analysis applies to a plaintiff's federal and state-law causes of action, a defendant does not waive its defense to the state-law claim by failing to present the state-law claim on appeal if it argued the federal claim).</p>\n<p>But even if Griffin has not abandoned this claim, it fails on the merits. Where a plaintiff asserts a battery claim under Tennessee law that arises out of the same use of force as her § 1983 excessive-force claim, the analysis is the same for both causes of action. That is, \"whether the analysis concerns whether an officer violated a plaintiff's constitutional rights by using excessive force or whether the analysis concerns whether an officer committed state-law battery by using force that was `clearly excessive,' the same principles... are applied.\" <i>Lee v. Metro. Gov't of Nashville &amp; Davidson County,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2515863\"><a href=\"/opinion/2515863/lee-v-metropolitan-government-of-nashville/\"><span class=\"volume\">596</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1101</span></a></span>, 1118 (M.D.Tenn.2009) (holding that officers entitled to summary judgment on a § 1983 excessive-force claim were automatically entitled to summary judgment on the Tennessee common-law battery claim); <i>see also Harris v. Metro.</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*957</span> <i>Gov't of Nashville,</i> No. 3:06-0868, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2007</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4481176</span></span>, at *9 (M.D.Tenn. Dec.18, 2007) (\"[T]he plaintiff has set forth adequate grounds for his [§ 1983] claim of excessive force against each of the officers. Because Tennessee courts apply the same `excessive force' principles to assault and battery claims against police officers, the plaintiff has additionally set forth adequate grounds against each of the officers for assault and battery under Tennessee law.\"). We thus find no error in the district court's conclusion that because Hardrick was entitled to summary judgment on Griffin's § 1983 claim, he was also entitled to summary judgment on her state-law battery claim.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>For all of the reasons set forth above, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p>HELENE N. WHITE, Circuit Judge (dissenting).</p>\n<p>I respectfully dissent. I agree that it is appropriate for the court to consider a video of the events when ruling on a motion for summary judgment, and to discount any allegations clearly rebutted by the video. I do not, however, agree that the video in this case clearly undermines Griffin's account leaving no genuine issue of material fact. I would reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p>In my view, the videotape does not \"blatantly contradict[]\" Griffin's version of the facts \"so that no reasonable jury could believe\" her, and therefore summary judgment was not appropriate. <i>Scott v. Harris,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145738\"><a href=\"/opinion/145738/scott-v-harris/\"><span class=\"volume\">550</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">372</span></a></span>, 380-81, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145738\"><a href=\"/opinion/145738/scott-v-harris/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1769</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145738\"><a href=\"/opinion/145738/scott-v-harris/\"><span class=\"volume\">167</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">686</span></a></span> (2007). Under <i>Scott,</i> in determining whether there are material factual disputes, we must accept the facts as depicted in the video, even when contrary to a party's sworn testimony. However, facts that are not clearly portrayed in the video remain entitled to an interpretation most favorable to the non-moving party. <i>Morales v. American Honda Motor Co., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"709212\"><a href=\"/opinion/709212/prodliabrep-cch-p-14437-pamela-morales-guardian-of-gary-thompson-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">71</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">531</span></a></span>, 535 (6th Cir. 1995); <i>see </i><i>Scott,</i> 550 U.S. at 380, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145738\"><a href=\"/opinion/145738/scott-v-harris/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1769</span></a></span> (facts must be viewed in a light most favorable to non-moving party when there is a \"genuine dispute as to those facts\"). Accepting all events portrayed in the video as true, there remains a material factual dispute as to whether Hardrick performed the takedown maneuver maliciously and sadistically to cause harm, rather than \"in a good-faith effort to maintain or restore discipline.\" <i>Hudson v. McMillian,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112693\"><a href=\"/opinion/112693/hudson-v-mcmillian/\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 6, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112693\"><a href=\"/opinion/112693/hudson-v-mcmillian/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">995</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112693\"><a href=\"/opinion/112693/hudson-v-mcmillian/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">156</span></a></span> (1992).</p>\n<p>In <i>Scott,</i> the Court found that the plaintiff's claim that he was driving in a \"cautious and controlled\" fashion was clearly rebutted by the video that showed him traveling upwards of 85 miles per hour on narrow roads, swerving around cars, crossing the double-yellow line, forcing other cars traveling in both directions to the side of the road, running multiple red lights, and driving in the left-turn-only lane. <i>Id.</i> at 379-80, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145738\"><a href=\"/opinion/145738/scott-v-harris/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1769</span></a></span>. The video here, however, does not definitively establish either what transpired prior to Hardrick executing the takedown maneuver, or that Hardrick did not act maliciously or wantonly in executing the maneuver.</p>\n<p>Griffin contends that Hardrick told her \"she was going to live in hell\" and that she \"was his bitch.\" The video, which has no accompanying audio, does not contradict this allegation. The district court's perception of the \"calmness\" of Hardrick's demeanor is not incompatible with his having made these statements to Griffin, and thus, at this point in the litigation, we should assume he did. As the district court recognized, such statements \"could indicate a `sadistic' or `malicious' state of mind at the time of the physical encounter.\" <i>See </i><i>Wilson v. Seiter,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112626\"><a href=\"/opinion/112626/wilson-v-seiter/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">294</span></a></span>, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*958</span> 302, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112626\"><a href=\"/opinion/112626/wilson-v-seiter/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2321</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112626\"><a href=\"/opinion/112626/wilson-v-seiter/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">271</span></a></span> (1991).</p>\n<p>The majority concludes that \"[m]ost importantly, the video establishes that Griffin was clearly struggling against both Hardrick and Rutledge before Hardrick employed the leg-sweep maneuver.\" I do not agree that the video shows that Griffin was struggling with the officers to an extent that no reasonable juror could conclude that Hardrick acted wantonly and maliciously in performing the takedown. The video does show that Griffin began walking away from Hardrick, and that she resisted his initial attempt to grab her arm. Griffin, however, contends that she did so because her arms were already sore and bruised, and that Hardrick's grip caused her additional pain. Indeed, Hardrick concedes that Griffin told him to \"watch [her] arms.\"</p>\n<p>The video is ambiguous, however, as to whether Griffin was continuing to struggle at the time of the takedown and, even if she was, whether Hardrick could plausibly have thought a takedown necessary under the circumstances. In the approximately eight second span from when Rutledge took hold of Griffin's other arm until Hardrick performed the takedown maneuver, Griffin can be seen continuing to talk with the two officers with no aggressive physical movement. Hardrick and Rutledge then pull her forward forcefully, sufficient to make her stumble. It appears that Griffin has almost regained her balance when Hardrick performs the takedown, and she continues to be restrained at both arms by the officers. Further, no other inmates were in the area, and a third corrections officer stood nearby observing and ready to intervene. <i>See </i><i>Seiter,</i> 501 U.S. at 303, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112626\"><a href=\"/opinion/112626/wilson-v-seiter/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2321</span></a></span> (whether conduct \"can be characterized as `wanton' depends upon the constraints facing the <i>official</i>\") (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p>To be sure, prison officials are entitled to \"wide-ranging deference in the adoption and execution of policies and practices that in their judgment are needed to preserve internal order.\" <i>Whitley v. Albers,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111610\"><a href=\"/opinion/111610/whitley-v-albers/\"><span class=\"volume\">475</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">312</span></a></span>, 321-22, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111610\"><a href=\"/opinion/111610/whitley-v-albers/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">251</span></a></span> (1986).

A jury viewing the events portrayed in the video in light of the statements Griffin attributes to Hardrick could reasonably conclude that Hardrick could not plausibly have thought that the use of the takedown maneuver, although executed properly, was necessary, and that, in fact, he performed it solely to inflict pain, even if not of the degree that ultimately occurred.</p>\n</div>",
