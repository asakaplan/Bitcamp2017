NORRIS, Circuit Judge. Petitioner Lewis Gagne and his co-defendant,\r\nDonald Swathwood, were each charged with three counts of criminal sexual misconduct for\r\n\r\n\r\n                                          1\r\n\fNo. 07-1970             Gagne v. Booker                                                             Page 2\r\n\r\n\r\nforcibly and simultaneously engaging in sexual activities with Gagne’s ex-girlfriend, Pamela\r\nClark. All of the charges arose out of events occurring over the course of one night. The\r\nkey question at trial was one of consent. The jury convicted Gagne of two counts, and\r\nSwathwood of three. Gagne filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, 28 U.S.C. § 2254,\r\nand the district court granted him relief on the basis that the state trial court’s decision to\r\nexclude certain evidence had violated Gagne’s due process right to present a meaningful\r\ndefense. Respondent, Warden Raymond Booker, represented by the Michigan Attorney\r\nGeneral (“the State”), appealed. We now affirm.\r\n\r\n                                                   I.\r\n\r\n                                                   A.\r\n\r\n        Gagne and Swathwood were each charged with three counts of first-degree criminal\r\n                                                               1\r\nsexual conduct. Mich. Comp. Laws § 750.520b(1)(f). Gagne’s three charges included\r\ntwo counts of forcible penis to mouth penetration and one count of forcible penis to\r\nvagina penetration, charges for which consent is a full defense. See People v. Waltonen,\r\n7238 N.W. 2d 881, 887 (Mich. Ct. App. 2006), appeal denied, 731 N.W. 2d 178 (Mich.\r\n2007); see also People v. Hearn, 300 N.W.2d 396, 398 (Mich. Ct. App. 1980). A jury\r\nconvicted Gagne of forcible vaginal penetration and of one count of forcible oral\r\npenetration.\r\n\r\n        The parties do not dispute the background facts that set the stage for what\r\noccurred on the night of July 3, 2000. The complainant, Clark, and Gagne dated from\r\nsome time in January until early June of that year. Gagne moved in with Clark in late\r\nJanuary or early February, and the two lived together until their relationship ended.\r\nThroughout this time, Clark worked, but Gagne did not, and Gagne would frequently use\r\nher work phone and her personal ATM card, sometimes without her knowledge.\r\n\r\n        1\r\n            That statute provides as follows:\r\n        Sec. 520b. (1) A person is guilty of criminal sexual conduct in the first degree if he or\r\n        she engages in sexual penetration with another person and . . .\r\n                (f) The actor causes personal injury to the victim and force or coercion is used\r\n        to accomplish sexual penetration.\r\nMich. Comp. Laws § 750.520b(1)(f).\r\n\fNo. 07-1970         Gagne v. Booker                                                Page 3\r\n\r\n\r\n        Also undisputed were the events that took place around midnight on July 3, 2000.\r\nAfter spending most of that day doing yardwork, during which time she consumed most\r\nof a pint of vodka, Clark retired to her house to watch television. Gagne arrived\r\nuninvited at about 10:45 p.m. He informed Clark that he and his friend Swathwood,\r\nwhom Clark also knew, were going to move to California.               Shortly thereafter\r\nSwathwood and a third man, Michael Stout, arrived. The group began drinking beer and\r\npossibly smoking marijuana. By Clark’s own estimate she consumed nine or ten beers\r\nduring this time.\r\n\r\n        This point in the story marks the beginning of the facts contested at trial. We\r\nbegin with the version urged by the prosecution, which was presented almost entirely\r\nthrough Clark’s testimony. At some point after midnight, Clark and Gagne took a\r\nshower together. Afterwards, Clark, who believed that Swathwood and Stout had left,\r\nparticipated in oral sex with Gagne in the living room. Swathwood entered the room and\r\nbegan engaging in intercourse with her while Gagne forcibly held her head down. A few\r\nminutes later, Gagne released Clark and the two went into the bedroom where Clark told\r\nGagne she did not want to have sex with Swathwood. Clark then began performing oral\r\nsex with Gagne. Swathwood again entered the room and began engaging in intercourse\r\nwith her. The men held Clark down, and each had intercourse and oral sex with her, at\r\nvarious points slapping her buttocks and using sexual devices that Clark kept in her\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n        At approximately five a.m. the men tired of this activity and left the room. Clark\r\nwent into the bathroom, vomited, took a shower, and returned to bed where she slept\r\nuntil approximately noon the next day. At that time she discovered her ATM card was\r\nmissing, and upon further investigation learned that at 5:28 that morning someone had\r\nwithdrawn $300 from her account, and had tried to withdraw more money twice in the\r\nfollowing fifteen minutes.\r\n\r\n        The defense’s version of events differed primarily on the issue of consent.\r\nAccording to Gagne and Swathwood, the group purchased and smoked some crack\r\ncocaine at around midnight. Clark then began talking with the men about engaging in\r\n\fNo. 07-1970             Gagne v. Booker                                                               Page 4\r\n\r\n\r\ngroup sex, and in large part instigated the group sexual activity, first in the living room\r\nand then later in the bedroom. Their description of the sexual activities differed only in\r\nthat Clark consented to them. They concede for instance, that they spanked Clark. At\r\nabout five a.m. Gagne and Clark agreed that Gagne should leave and purchase more\r\ncrack with money withdrawn using her ATM card. All three men left in Clark’s car.\r\nGagne dropped Stout off at home, withdrew $300 from an ATM using Clark’s card, and\r\nthen drove to a street corner and purchased crack. The defendants became nervous when\r\nthey saw police cars in the area, so instead of returning home, they drove to a cemetery\r\nand smoked the crack. The defendants testified that they returned to Clark’s house later\r\nthat morning and Gagne returned her ATM card. Clark was angry and told Gagne to\r\nleave, so he did.\r\n\r\n        Clark testified that, two days later, she told her adult son that she had been raped.\r\nShe also told the police, and saw several doctors. The doctors noted that she had some\r\nbruising but no trauma to her wrists or shoulders, which are typically present after a\r\nsexual assault. Nor did any of the doctors find any internal or external tears to Clark’s\r\nvagina or rectum.\r\n\r\n                                                    B.\r\n\r\n        As noted above, at the heart of Gagne’s petition for habeas corpus is the trial\r\njudge’s exclusion of certain evidence from the trial. As required by the Michigan rape\r\nshield law, Mich. Comp. Laws § 750.520j(1) & (2),2 Gagne filed a motion in limine\r\nseeking to introduce evidence regarding several aspects of Clark’s prior sexual\r\nexperiences and tastes. The trial judge denied the motion in part, excluding evidence\r\n\r\n\r\n        2\r\n            The substantive portion of that law provides:\r\n        Sec. 520j (1) Evidence of specific instances of the victim's sexual conduct, opinion\r\n        evidence of the victim’s sexual conduct, and reputation evidence of the victim’s sexual\r\n        conduct shall not be admitted under sections 520b to 520g unless and only to the extent\r\n        that the judge finds that the following proposed evidence is material to a fact at issue in\r\n        the case and that its inflammatory or prejudicial nature does not outweigh its probative\r\n        value:\r\n                   (a) Evidence of the victim's past sexual conduct with the actor.\r\nMich. Comp. Laws § 750.520j (1) (a).\r\n\fNo. 07-1970        Gagne v. Booker                                               Page 5\r\n\r\n\r\nregarding two subjects that are relevant here: an incident of group sexual activity\r\ninvolving Gagne, Clark, and a man named Ruben Bermudez; and Clark’s solicitation of\r\nGagne’s father to join her and Gagne in group sex. The court’s exclusion of this\r\nevidence gives rise to this appeal.\r\n\r\n       The court also granted Gagne’s motion in part, and, because it is especially\r\nrelevant to our analysis, we recount in some detail the evidence the court decided to\r\nadmit regarding sexual activity that occurred one night involving Gagne, Swathwood,\r\nClark, and two other females they met at a bar called Tony’s Lounge (“the Tony’s\r\nLounge incident”). In the spring of 2000, Clark, Swathwood, and Gagne went to Tony’s\r\nLounge, where they drank for some time. At the bar Swathwood met two women. All\r\nfive of them departed together and went to a house belonging to one of the women.\r\nThere were people at the house when they arrived. Clark and Gagne began to engage\r\nin some sort of “sexual behavior” in the living room while Swathwood had intercourse\r\nnearby with the other two women. Clark testified that she did not “engage in sex of\r\nwhatever kind with Donny Swathwood” while they were in the living room. When\r\nsomeone knocked at the door, Clark and Gagne relocated to the bedroom where they\r\nbegan alternately having intercourse and arguing. Swathwood brought the other women\r\ninto the bedroom. Gagne and Clark’s argument escalated, and finally Clark left and\r\nwent home.\r\n\r\n       Clark was extremely intoxicated during these events; she testified that she drove\r\nhome that night but did not remember doing so. The next day, Gagne informed her that\r\nthere was more from the previous night that she did not remember, including that she\r\nhad engaged in oral sex with Swathwood. Clark testified that she had no memory of\r\nthis. Nonetheless, she believed Gagne and told others what had happened with\r\nSwathwood, including Swathwood’s girlfriend at the time.\r\n\r\n       Finally, Clark testified that, at some later date, she and Gagne “were talking\r\nabout being with other men or being with other women” sexually, and discussed the\r\nTony’s Lounge incident:\r\n\fNo. 07-1970        Gagne v. Booker                                                 Page 6\r\n\r\n\r\n       And I told him that, you know, I honestly have not been with any other\r\n       man except what you told me about [Swathwood] and I don’t remember\r\n       that. And he said to me, I was just lying ’cause I wanted to go to bed\r\n       with the same – the girl that [Swathwood] was having sex with. And I\r\n       – and then he told me that he did have sex with her that night. And she\r\n       – the girl had told me something different.\r\n\r\nFor his part, Swathwood testified that Clark engaged in oral sex with him that night in\r\nthe presence of Gagne and the other two women. Swathwood answered “yes” when\r\nasked, “Fair assessment to say this was kind of a group-sex, orgy-type situation?”\r\n\r\n       In her closing argument, the prosecutor repeatedly emphasized the unlikeliness\r\nof the defendants’ version of the story, which, in her words, was “more consistent with\r\nthe pornographic movie than real life.” The defense responded by attacking Clark’s\r\ncredibility and arguing that she had consented by pointing to the Tony’s Lounge incident\r\nas evidence of this theory. During rebuttal, the prosecution argued to the jury, that,\r\ninsofar as the Tony’s Lounge incident was concerned, “Even if you believe, contrary to\r\n. . . what Ms. Clark told you, that she did engage in consen[s]ual sexual contact with Mr.\r\nSwathwood, the nature of the contact and relations here were 190 degrees [sic] different.\r\nThat situation did not involve, ladies and gentlemen, two men.”\r\n\r\n       On direct appeal, Gagne raised a number of claims, only one of which is relevant\r\nhere: that the trial court violated his due process right to present a defense when it\r\nexcluded the evidence regarding the group sexual activity with Bermudez, and Clark’s\r\nsolicitation of Gagne’s father to participate in group sex with her and Gagne.\r\n\r\n       The state appellate court acknowledged that rape shield statutes can occasionally\r\nabridge a defendant’s constitutional rights, but concluded that the evidence of the group\r\nsexual activity with Bermudez and the invitation to Gagne’s father were irrelevant\r\nbecause they involved third parties, not Swathwood. People v. Swathwood, Nos. 235540\r\nand 235541, 2003 WL 1880143, at *1-2 (Mich. Ct. App. Apr. 15, 2003). Additionally,\r\nthe Bermudez incident was said to be even less relevant because it had occurred while\r\nClark and Gagne were dating; by July 3, the couple had been separated for three weeks.\r\nId. at *2. The court of appeals also determined that Gagne’s constitutional rights were\r\n\fNo. 07-1970            Gagne v. Booker                                                            Page 7\r\n\r\n\r\nnot violated because he was allowed to present evidence regarding the Tony’s Lounge\r\nincident, which the court felt sufficiently demonstrated that Clark “was not averse to\r\ngroup sexual activity.” Id. at *3.\r\n\r\n         The court of appeals affirmed Gagne and Swathwood’s convictions and\r\nremanded for sentencing determinations that are irrelevant to this appeal. The state court\r\nproceedings ended when the Michigan Supreme Court denied Gagne leave to appeal.3\r\nPeople v. Gagne, 673 N.W.2d 755 (Mich. 2003) (unpublished table decision).\r\n\r\n         Gagne filed a pro se petition for a writ of habeas corpus, asserting four claims.\r\nThe district court granted relief on the due process claim arising from the trial court’s\r\nexclusion of evidence. The court determined that relief was warranted because the\r\nexcluded evidence was highly relevant since it involved occurrences remarkable in their\r\nsimilarity to the events on the night of July 3. This evidence was crucial to the defense\r\nbecause this case was essentially a “credibility contest” between Clark on the one hand,\r\nand Gagne and Swathwood on the other. The court granted Gagne a conditional writ of\r\nhabeas corpus, and the State timely appealed.\r\n\r\n                                                   II.\r\n\r\n         We review a district court’s decision to grant habeas relief de novo. Hereford\r\nv. Warren, 536 F.3d 523, 527 (6th Cir. 2008). Because Gagne filed his habeas petition\r\nafter the enactment of the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996\r\n(“AEDPA”), Pub. L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214, we review the last reasoned state\r\ncourt decision on the issue to determine whether that decision “was contrary to, or\r\ninvolved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined\r\nby the Supreme Court of the United States,” or “was based on an unreasonable\r\ndetermination of the facts.” 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d).                 A state court’s determination is\r\ncontrary to clearly established federal law if “the state court arrives at a conclusion\r\n\r\n\r\n         3\r\n           At this point Gagne and Swathwood’s legal proceedings parted ways. Swathwood missed the\r\ndeadline to apply for leave to appeal in the Michigan Supreme Court, so his application was denied. See\r\nSwathwood v. Lafler, No. 04-CV-72251, 2009 WL 322041, at *3 (E.D. Mich. Feb, 10, 2009). He also\r\nfiled a habeas petition, but the court denied relief because his claims were procedurally defaulted due to\r\nhis missing the deadline in the Michigan Supreme Court. Id. at *8.\r\n\fNo. 07-1970          Gagne v. Booker                                                Page 8\r\n\r\n\r\nopposite to that reached by [the Supreme Court] on a question of law or if the state court\r\ndecides a case differently than [the Supreme Court] has on a set of materially\r\nindistinguishable facts.” Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362, 412-13 (2000). A state-court\r\ndecision is an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law “if the state\r\ncourt identifies the correct governing legal principle from [the Supreme Court’s]\r\ndecisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner’s case.” Id.\r\nat 413.\r\n\r\n                                            III.\r\n\r\n          The Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized that the right to present a complete\r\ndefense in a criminal proceeding is one of the foundational principles of our adversarial\r\ntruth-finding process: “Whether rooted directly in the Due Process Clause of the\r\nFourteenth Amendment or in the Compulsory Process or Confrontation Clauses of the\r\nSixth Amendment, the Constitution guarantees criminal defendants ‘a meaningful\r\nopportunity to present a complete defense.’” Holmes v. South Carolina, 547 U.S. 319,\r\n324 (2006) (quoting Crane v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 683, 690 (1986) (quoting California\r\nv. Trombetta, 467 U.S. 479, 485 (1984)) (internal quotation marks omitted). But a\r\n“meaningful opportunity” is not “every opportunity,” and relevant evidence is frequently\r\nexcluded from trial.      Trial judges must make “dozens, sometimes hundreds” of\r\nevidentiary decisions throughout the course of a typical case, and rarely are these of\r\nconstitutional significance: “the Constitution leaves to the judges who must make these\r\ndecisions ‘wide latitude’ to exclude evidence that is ‘repetitive . . . , only marginally\r\nrelevant’ or poses an undue risk of ‘harassment, prejudice, [or] confusion of the issues.’”\r\nCrane, 476 U.S. at 689-90 (quoting Delaware v. Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. 673, 679 (1986))\r\n(alterations and omissions in original). But while the Constitution leaves much in the\r\nhands of the trial judge, “an essential component of procedural fairness is an opportunity\r\nto be heard.” Id. at 690.\r\n\r\n          The Supreme Court in Crane made clear that whether a defendant has a\r\nconstitutional right to present evidence turns on the extent to which that evidence is so\r\n“highly relevant” that it becomes “indispensable” to the success of the defense. 476 U.S.\r\n\fNo. 07-1970            Gagne v. Booker                                               Page 9\r\n\r\n\r\nat 691. In that case, the trial court excluded evidence of the circumstances surrounding\r\nthe defendant’s confession, which the defense argued would have cast doubt on the\r\ncredibility of that confession. Id. at 684-86. The Supreme Court, in determining that\r\nthis exclusion violated the defendant’s right to present a meaningful defense, explained\r\nthat the “opportunity [to be heard] would be an empty one if the State were permitted to\r\nexclude competent, reliable evidence bearing on the credibility of a confession when\r\nsuch evidence is central to the defendant’s claim of innocence.” Id. at 690. The\r\nevidence, which related to the physical circumstances of the confession, was so “highly\r\nrelevant to [the] reliability and credibility” of the confession, and the confession was so\r\nintegral to the defense, that the excluded evidence was “all but indispensable to any\r\nchance of [that defense] succeeding.” Id. at 691.\r\n\r\n        In Crane, the Court’s inquiry did not end with consideration of the defendant’s\r\ninterests. Rather, the Court sought to balance those interests against the state’s interests\r\nin the evidentiary exclusion at issue; simplifying the Court’s task was the fact that the\r\nstate did not attempt to come forward with a justification for the questioned exclusion.\r\nCrane, 476 U.S. at 691.\r\n\r\n        Thus, Crane makes clear that a proper inquiry into the constitutionality of a\r\ncourt’s decision to exclude evidence begins with considering the relevancy and\r\ncumulative nature of the excluded evidence, and the extent to which it was “central” or\r\n“indispensable” to the defense. Against this courts must balance the state’s interests in\r\nenforcing the evidentiary rule on which the exclusion was based, in this case Michigan’s\r\nrape shield statute.\r\n\r\n        When applying this delicate balance to the Michigan rape shield statute, we do\r\nnot write on a blank slate. The Supreme Court has already considered that statute and,\r\nin doing so, reiterated these competing considerations. Michigan v. Lucas, 500 U.S. 145\r\n(1991). In that case, the Court reviewed a holding of the Michigan Court of Appeals that\r\nthe rape shield statute’s “notice-and-hearing requirement is unconstitutional in all cases\r\nwhere it is used to preclude evidence of past sexual conduct between a rape victim and\r\na criminal defendant.” Id. at 148. Among other provisions, the statute requires the\r\n\fNo. 07-1970         Gagne v. Booker                                               Page 10\r\n\r\n\r\naccused to file “a written motion and offer of proof” within ten days of his arraignment\r\nif he plans to introduce evidence of the victim’s past sexual conduct. Mich. Comp. Laws\r\n§ 750.20j(2). In Lucas, the defendant failed to file the motion in a timely manner and\r\nthe trial court excluded the evidence on that basis. The Supreme Court recognized that\r\n“the [rape shield] statute unquestionably implicates the Sixth Amendment” but also\r\nnoted that placing limits on the ability to present a defense “does not necessarily render\r\nthe statute unconstitutional.” Lucas, 500 U.S. at 149. Quoting the same passage from\r\nVan Arsdall, 475 U.S. at 679, that it relied upon in Crane, supra, the Court recognized\r\nthe wide latitude enjoyed by trial judges to limit the introduction of evidence. Id. In the\r\nCourt’s view, the Michigan rape shield law “represents a valid legislative determination\r\nthat rape victims deserve heightened protection against surprise, harassment, and\r\nunnecessary invasions of privacy.” Id. at 150. Given these competing considerations,\r\nthe Court framed the question posed to it as follows: “[W]hether the legitimate interests\r\nserved by a notice requirement can ever justify precluding evidence of a prior sexual\r\nrelationship between a rape victim and a criminal defendant.” Id. at 151.\r\n\r\n        The Court answered in the affirmative and reversed the per se rule of the\r\nMichigan Court of Appeals. Id. at 152-53. Significantly in our view, it did not hold that\r\npreclusion of evidence for failure to comply with a notice provision is always\r\nappropriate. As in all of its cases balancing evidentiary considerations with the right to\r\npresent a complete defense, the Court made clear that a case by case evaluation is\r\nrequired. Accordingly, it remanded for the Michigan courts to perform such a balancing\r\nand, in doing so, the Court “express[ed] no opinion as to whether or not preclusion was\r\njustified in this case.” Id. at 153.\r\n\r\n                                           IV.\r\n\r\n        With these precepts in mind, we turn to the facts before us. The writ may issue\r\nonly when petitioner is “in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of\r\nthe United States.” 28 U.S.C. § 2241(c)(3). And, as we stressed earlier in this opinion,\r\nour task is not to reach our own independent conclusion regarding the constitutional\r\nvalidity of the evidentiary decision to exclude evidence; rather, we must determine if the\r\n\fNo. 07-1970            Gagne v. Booker                                                             Page 11\r\n\r\n\r\nlast reasoned state court opinion was either contrary to or involved an unreasonable\r\napplication of clearly established federal law as determined by the Supreme Court of the\r\nUnited States. 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1).4\r\n\r\n         The Michigan Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court’s judgment. It\r\nacknowledged that evidentiary laws, including rape shield statutes, must give way when\r\nconstitutional rights of the accused, specifically the Sixth Amendment right to\r\nconfrontation, are implicated. People v. Swathwood, 2003 WL 1880143, at *1 (citing\r\nPeople v. Hackett, 365 N.W.2d 120, 124 (Mich. 1984) (“in certain limited situations,\r\nsuch evidence [of prior sexual conduct] may not only be relevant, but its admission may\r\nbe required to preserve a defendant’s constitutional right to confrontation”)). Balanced\r\nagainst these constitutional considerations, the court of appeals observed that the\r\nMichigan Supreme Court has instructed trial courts to be “mindful of the significant\r\nlegislative purposes underlying the rape-shield statute and should always favor exclusion\r\nof evidence of a complainant’s sexual conduct where its exclusion would not\r\nunconstitutionally abridge the defendant’s right to confrontation.” Id. (quoting People\r\nv. Adair, 550 N.W.2d 505, 511 (Mich. 1996) (quoting Hackett, 365 N.W.2d at 125))\r\n(quotation marks omitted). The balance struck by the court of appeals in this case is\r\nentirely consistent with the approach taken by the United States Supreme Court in Lucas.\r\nWhile the Michigan Court of Appeals did not cite federal constitutional law in its\r\ndecision, its rendition of the appropriate legal analysis was not “contrary to” the “clearly\r\nestablished” federal law reflected in either Crane or Lucas.\r\n\r\n         That being the case, the writ may issue only if the court of appeals unreasonably\r\napplied that law. 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1). We conclude that it did. With respect to the\r\nevidence regarding a “threesome” that included petitioner, Clark, and Bermudez, it\r\nreasoned as follows:\r\n\r\n         [T]he complainant’s willing participation in a threesome with Gagne and\r\n         Bermudez is not probative of whether she consented to a threesome with\r\n\r\n         4\r\n          The parties do not argue that the Michigan courts violated AEDPA by basing their decision “on\r\nan unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.”\r\n28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(2).\r\n\fNo. 07-1970           Gagne v. Booker                                                         Page 12\r\n\r\n\r\n         Gagne and Swathwood on the night of the alleged offense. Notably, the\r\n         threesome involving Bermudez occurred while the complainant and\r\n         Gagne were still dating. The instant offense occurred after they had\r\n         ended their relationship, and it involved Swathwood, not Bermudez. In\r\n         light of the lack of similarity between the Bermudez threesome and the\r\n         instant offense, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its\r\n         discretion in excluding the evidence.\r\n\r\nSwathwood, at *2. The court of appeals also observed that the jury heard at length about\r\nthe group sexual activity that followed the visit to Tony’s Lounge, which included Clark\r\nand multiple partners. Id. at *3. Thus, “defendants presented evidence that the\r\ncomplainant was not averse to group sexual activity” and “the trial court did not abuse\r\nits discretion in excluding the evidence.” Id. at *2-3. The court employed similar\r\nreasoning before reaching the same conclusion with respect to the invitation to Gagne’s\r\nfather to join in group sex. Id. at *3.\r\n\r\n         In our view, the court of appeals underestimated the vital nature of the disputed\r\nmaterial, which we believe to be highly relevant, primarily as substantive evidence on\r\nthe issue of whether Clark consented to the sexual activity the night of July 3, 2000.5\r\nThe State argues otherwise in its brief to this court; inferring Clark’s consent from these\r\npast incidents is\r\n\r\n         the very inference that rape-shield laws are meant to avoid; that\r\n         somehow consent to unrelated sexual activity is relevant to whether the\r\n         victim consented to the charged offense. Like evidence of a defendant’s\r\n         prior criminal acts, governed by MRE and FRE 404(b), propensity\r\n         evidence carries a significant danger of unfair inference and prejudice.\r\n\r\nThe State is correct that evidentiary rules generally disfavor showing a person’s\r\npropensity for certain actions by introducing evidence of past similar acts, and it is\r\nfurther correct that in rape cases evidence regarding “unrelated sexual activity” is\r\ngenerally accepted as only minimally relevant to the question of consent. But rape\r\nshield laws, including Michigan’s, almost universally except from this rule evidence\r\nregarding prior sexual activity between the complainant and the defendant, precisely\r\n\r\n         5\r\n          It may also have impeachment purposes, but in our view, this purpose is less relevant than the\r\nsubstantive role this evidence would play, so we focus our analysis on the latter.\r\n\fNo. 07-1970         Gagne v. Booker                                                Page 13\r\n\r\n\r\nbecause that evidence carries heightened relevancy due to its increased similarity to the\r\ninstance of the alleged rape. See Mich. Comp. Laws § 750.520j(1)(a); see also Fed. R.\r\nEvid. 412(b)(1)(B). In this case, these prior incidents have significant relevance not only\r\nbecause Gagne and Clark were involved in them, but also because they are both\r\nremarkably similar to the events that occurred the night of July 3.\r\n\r\n        Nor do we agree with the State that the excluded evidence was cumulative to the\r\ntestimony already introduced regarding the Tony’s Lounge incident. There are, of\r\ncourse, similarities between this evidence and the excluded evidence: if Swathwood’s\r\nversion of the Tony’s Lounge incident is believed, then it demonstrates that Clark had,\r\non at least one occasion, engaged in sexual activities of some variety with multiple\r\npartners over the course of one night; it also shows that she did so with Gagne and\r\nSwathwood. But we find the differences, which the prosecution took pains to highlight\r\nin closing argument, to be more significant. First, the evidence that Clark engaged in\r\ngroup sex during the Tony’s Lounge incident is at best equivocal because Clark testified\r\nthat she did not remember engaging in any sexual activities with Swathwood that night.\r\nShe further testified that Gagne later told her that he had made up that part of the story.\r\nAnd although Swathwood testified that this had, in fact, occurred, it would have been\r\nobvious to the jury that he had reason to lie about this incident in order to show that\r\nClark had engaged in these similar activities in the past. The prosecution realized that\r\nthe jury might not believe Swathwood and argued in closing that Clark had not engaged\r\nin oral sex with Swathwood during the Tony’s Lounge incident.\r\n\r\n        Second, even if the jury did believe that Clark and Swathwood had engaged in\r\nsome sexual activity that night, there is no evidence at all that Clark engaged in that\r\nactivity with multiple partners at once. At most the evidence shows only that, at some\r\npoint during that night, she engaged in sexual intercourse with Gagne, and, at another\r\npoint during the night, she engaged in oral sex with Swathwood, and did so in the\r\npresence of other people. This kind of activity differs substantially from the activity that\r\noccurred the night of July 3, in which three people engaged in simultaneous group sex.\r\nThe prosecution, in discussing the Tony’s Lounge incident, pointed out this difference\r\n\fNo. 07-1970             Gagne v. Booker                                                              Page 14\r\n\r\n\r\nto the jury in closing: “Even if you believe, contrary to . . . what Ms. Clark told you, that\r\nshe did engage in consen[s]ual sexual contact with Mr. Swathwood, the nature of the\r\ncontact and relations here were 190 degrees [sic] different. That situation did not\r\ninvolve, ladies and gentlemen, two men.”\r\n\r\n         Finally, even if the excluded evidence merely points to the same predilections\r\nshown by the Tony’s Lounge incident, the entire trial hinged upon consent, so the weight\r\nof the evidence on this question is extremely important. This is evident from the closing\r\narguments, in which the prosecutor repeatedly stressed the unlikeliness of Gagne’s story,\r\nand told the the jury that his story was “much more consistent with the pornographic\r\nmovie than real life.” The defense’s theory was that Clark consented to the activities of\r\nJuly 3, but it had only the Tony’s Lounge incident as evidence that she may have done\r\nso. In our view, the exclusion of the evidence of the group sexual activity with\r\nBermudez and the invitation to Gagne’s father were indispensable to the jury’s ability\r\nto assess the likelihood of this theory.\r\n\r\n         We cannot accurately portray the extent of Gagne’s interest in presenting this\r\nevidence without reference to the lack of other evidence in this case. Other than the two\r\ndefendants and the complainant, there were no eyewitnesses at all.6 Nor did the physical\r\nevidence tend weigh in favor of one side or the other. In short, the excluded evidence\r\nwas not just relevant to this case, it was in all likelihood the most relevant evidence\r\nregarding the sole contested issue at trial – an issue about which there was not much\r\nevidence in the first place. We believe it was indispensable to the defense’s theory, a\r\nconclusion amply demonstrated by the consistent focus during closing arguments on\r\nwhat little evidence the court did admit regarding the likelihood (or unlikelihood) that\r\nClark would have consented to the activity the night of July 3, 2000.\r\n\r\n         With this in mind, we turn to the Michigan Supreme Court for an indication of\r\nthe State’s interests in enforcing the rape shield statute. As the court of appeals\r\n\r\n\r\n         6\r\n          Stout was present for at least some of the activity, but he testified that he was so intoxicated that\r\nhe remembers nothing, a claim that is in line with Gagne, Swathwood, and Clark’s accounts of Stout’s\r\ngeneral state of intoxication that night.\r\n\fNo. 07-1970         Gagne v. Booker                                                 Page 15\r\n\r\n\r\nrecognized, the Michigan Supreme Court has explained that those interests are two-fold:\r\nto encourage victims to report criminal activity and testify at trial; and to further the\r\ntruth-finding process by preventing the admission of minimally relevant evidence that\r\ncreates a significant risk of prejudice or confusion. See Adair, 550 N.W.2d at 509. We\r\nhave acknowledged that there is always a real risk that allowing evidence concerning a\r\ncomplainant’s sexual history will turn the case into a trial of the victim instead of the\r\ndefendant. Lewis v. Wilkinson, 307 F.3d 413, 422 (6th Cir. 2002).\r\n\r\n        Nonetheless, we do not believe that admitting the evidence at issue in this case\r\nwould overly frustrate the legitimate purposes of the rape shield statute. After all, the\r\nstatute itself contains exceptions that demonstrate that the interests it usually serves must\r\nalso accommodate the defendant’s interest in the admission of evidence that is highly\r\nrelevant, such as prior sexual conduct between the complainant and the defendant.\r\nWhile we are not reviewing the manner in which the Michigan courts applied the rape\r\nshield statute, which is a matter of state law, the fact that it contains this exception\r\nillustrates that the Michigan legislature recognized that the defendant has a heightened\r\nclaim to the introduction of evidence of previous sexual contact with his accuser. This\r\nis not a case involving sex a decade before the subject incident. And what made the\r\nevidence even more central to petitioner’s defense was the extraordinary nature of the\r\nevents giving rise to the charge. The idea that someone could have consented to this sort\r\nof thing seems incredible absent proof that the person had consented to it before.\r\nTherein lies another similarity to Crane. In the underlying trial in Crane and in this\r\ncase, the evidence that was admitted gave rise to a “question every rational juror needs\r\nanswered[.]” 469 U.S. at 689. In Crane, that question was, “[i]f the defendant is\r\ninnocent, why did he previously admit his guilt?” Id. Here the question jurors would\r\nneed to have answered if Gagne was to be acquitted was, “how is it possible for anyone\r\nto consent to three-way sex of the kind described here?” In each case the exclusion of\r\nevidence “effectively disabled” the defendant from answering the question.                Id.\r\nMoreover, in this case, the excluded evidence would not have been unfairly prejudicial\r\ngiven the sexually graphic testimony that had already been admitted as well as the\r\ntestimony involving the use of crack cocaine and other narcotics. And as we pointed out\r\n\fNo. 07-1970         Gagne v. Booker                                               Page 16\r\n\r\n\r\nin Lewis, “the court could minimize any danger of undue prejudice by admitting the\r\nevidence with a cautionary instruction and strictly limiting the scope of cross-\r\nexamination.” Id.\r\n\r\n       Finally, we stress that our holding is fact-bound in the extreme: under the\r\ncircumstances present here, the exclusion of evidence of the complainant’s consensual\r\nthree-way sex with the defendant only a month before the subject incident, in a three-\r\nway rape case in which extensive evidence of the victim’s sexual conduct had already\r\nbeen admitted at trial, and where the question of guilt or innocence turned almost\r\nentirely on the credibility of the victim’s testimony regarding consent, was an\r\nunreasonable application of the principles set forth by the Supreme Court in Crane. That\r\ncase made clear that a defendant’s constitutional right to present a defense, arising from\r\nthe Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, entails the right to put before the\r\njury evidence which is highly relevant, non-cumulative, and indispensable to the central\r\ndispute in a criminal trial. This conclusion is also consistent with Lucas, a case in which\r\nthe Court recognized that the Michigan rape shield statute implicates the Sixth\r\nAmendment rights of the accused and therefore its application must be carefully\r\nbalanced against the legitimate interests served by the statute on a case by case basis.\r\nLucas, 550 U.S. at 149. Reliance upon those legitimate interests in this case to exclude\r\nthe incidents at issue runs contrary to the statute’s exception that would allow a\r\ndefendant – in this case petitioner – to present evidence of the victim’s past sexual\r\nconduct with the actor. Mich. Comp. Laws § 750.520j. While the trial judge may\r\nexclude such evidence if its inflammatory or prejudicial nature outweighs its probative\r\nvalue, that discretion cannot trump the constitutional right of the accused to present\r\nevidence that is so “highly relevant” that its introduction, as in this case, is\r\n“indispensable” to the defense. Crane, 476 U.S. at 691. For these reasons, we hold that\r\nthe Michigan Court of Appeals opinion constitutes an “unreasonable application of[]\r\nclearly established Federal law,” 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1), that deprived petitioner of his\r\nconstitutional right to “a meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense” as\r\narticulated by the Supreme Court in Crane. The writ shall issue.\r\n\fNo. 07-1970      Gagne v.

It is hard for a court to invalidate a\r\nprovision that does not even apply to the case at hand. It is harder still to invalidate a\r\nwhole gaggle of provisions that actually support the result reached in the case. Yet that,\r\naccording to the rhetoric in support of the State’s petition for rehearing, is the feat we\r\nhave managed here. I think the rhetoric is seriously overblown.\r\n\r\n        We are told, in support of rehearing, that our decision effectively invalidates\r\nevery rape-shield law in this circuit. That argument cannot be squared with the text of\r\nthose laws. The core of any rape-shield law is its proscription against evidence of past\r\nsexual activity by the victim. But every one of those laws—or at least every one we are\r\nsaid to have vaporized here—contains an exception for evidence of the victim’s prior\r\nsexual activity with the defendant. And that is exactly the kind of evidence that we hold\r\nshould have been admitted in this case. Michigan’s statute excepts from its proscription\r\n“[e]vidence of the victim’s past sexual conduct with the actor.” Mich. Comp. Laws\r\n§ 750.520j(1)(a). Ohio’s statute does the same. See Ohio Rev. Code § 2907.02(D)\r\n(excepting evidence of “the victim’s past sexual activity with the offender”). So does\r\nthe Tennessee rule. See Tenn. R. Evid. 412(c)(3) (allowing admission of evidence of\r\n“sexual behavior . . . with the accused, on the issue of consent”). The federal rule\r\naffirmatively provides that “evidence of specific instances of sexual behavior” between\r\nthe alleged victim and defendant “is admissible,” if offered to prove consent and\r\notherwise admissible under the rules. Fed. R. Evid. 412(b)(1)(B) (emphasis added).\r\nKentucky’s rule is identical to the federal one. See Ky. R. Evid. 412(b)(1)(B). I am of\r\ncourse mindful that we apply only constitutional rules, not statutory ones, on habeas\r\nreview. But rhetorically speaking, our decision applies these laws, rather than abrogates\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n        Equally misdirected is the claim that we have trampled upon the policies that\r\nanimate these laws. As Judge Norris’s opinion carefully explains, we hold that, under\r\n\fNo. 07-1970          Gagne v. Booker                                               Page 19\r\n\r\n\r\nthe rather extraordinary facts presented here, certain evidence of the complainant’s prior\r\nconsensual sex with the defendant was indispensable to his ability to present a complete\r\ndefense at trial. The argument now is that, in deeming that evidence indispensable, we\r\nhave indulged in outdated inferences whose eradication was a principal aim of these\r\nlaws. But the argument again is let down by the laws. Every one of these laws is\r\nsupported by significant state interests. (The extent to which those interests are\r\nimplicated in a particular case, as discussed below, is another matter.) And yet,\r\nnotwithstanding those important interests, every one of these laws contains an exception\r\nfor evidence of consensual sex with the defendant. These laws must infer something\r\nvery important about such evidence; and they do so especially in cases—like this\r\none—where consent itself is the issue. The inference is that, in some (and perhaps most)\r\ncases, evidence of past consensual sex with the defendant is highly relevant to the issue\r\nof consent in the incident giving rise to the charge. We merely conclude that this is such\r\na case.\r\n\r\n          Notable as well is that the caselaw in Michigan, and the terms of the federal and\r\nTennessee rules, expressly wave off the rape-shield proscription as to “evidence the\r\nexclusion of which would violate the constitutional rights of the defendant.” Fed. R.\r\nEvid. 412(b)(1)(C); see also People v. Hackett, 365 N.W.2d 120, 124 (Mich. 1984)\r\n(recognizing that, in some situations, admission of evidence relating to the victim’s\r\nsexual conduct “may be required to preserve a defendant’s constitutional right to\r\nconfrontation”); People v. Adair, 550 N.W.2d 505, 511 (Mich. 1996) (rejecting a\r\nconstruction of Michigan’s rape-shield statute that would have “run[] the risk of\r\nviolating a defendant’s Sixth Amendment constitutional right to confrontation”); Tenn.\r\nR. Evid. 412(c)(1). We do not, of course, look to these rules in determining whether\r\nthere was a violation of clearly established federal constitutional law. But these\r\nprovisions do show that the rules’ drafters knew very well that they were operating close\r\nto the constitutional line. That the rules’ application might cross it, on occasion, should\r\nsurprise no one.\r\n\fNo. 07-1970         Gagne v. Booker                                                Page 20\r\n\r\n\r\n        I also think the rehearing petition overstates the breadth of our holding in this\r\ncase. We do not hold that the Supreme Court’s decision in Crane v. Kentucky, 476 U.S.\r\n683 (1986), clearly establishes a rape defendant’s constitutional right to admit evidence\r\nof the victim’s prior consensual activity with the defendant (much less with persons\r\nother than the defendant). What we do say, as a starting point for the analysis, is that\r\nCrane clearly establishes that “the Constitution guarantees criminal defendants ‘a\r\nmeaningful opportunity to present a complete defense.’” Id. at 690 (quoting California\r\nv. Trombetta, 467 U.S. 479, 485 (1984)). The State of Ohio, as amicus, says this rule is\r\nstated at too high a level of generality to support habeas relief here. That point is a\r\nserious one; the more general a rule, the more difficult it is to say that the state court\r\nunreasonably applied the rule to a particular set of facts. With generality often comes\r\ndiscretion. But I think the facts of Crane and those of this case converge at a level closer\r\nto the ground than the State realizes.\r\n\r\n        Crane requires consideration of two factors in determining whether the exclusion\r\nof evidence denies the defendant a meaningful right to present a complete defense. The\r\nfirst is the extent to which the evidence was “central to the defendant’s claim of\r\ninnocence.” Id. The second is the extent to which its exclusion was supported by a\r\n“valid state justification[.]” Id. In Crane, the defendant was convicted of murder. He\r\nwas 16 years old at the time of the crime. There was “no physical evidence to link him”\r\nto the murder. Id. at 691. The State’s evidence of guilt was primarily Crane’s own\r\nconfession. Crane sought to discredit the confession with testimony that “he had been\r\ndetained in a windowless room for a protracted period of time, that he had been\r\nsurrounded by as many as six police officers during the interrogation, that he had\r\nrepeatedly requested and been denied permission to telephone his mother, and that he\r\nhad been badgered into making a false confession.” Id. at 685. That evidence, the\r\nSupreme Court said, was “highly relevant” to the reliability and credibility of the\r\nconfession, which again was the State’s primary evidence of guilt. Id. at 691. And the\r\nCourt saw no justification for excluding the evidence under the circumstances presented\r\nthere. The Court did not “pass on the strength or merits” of Crane’s defense. Id. But\r\n\fNo. 07-1970        Gagne v. Booker                                                Page 21\r\n\r\n\r\nit held, unanimously, that the exclusion of Crane’s testimony violated his right to present\r\na complete defense.\r\n\r\n        The analysis flows in the same channels here. First, the excluded evidence was\r\n“central to the defendant’s claim of innocence.” Id. at 690. Gagne was convicted of\r\nforcing Clark to engage in an outlandish sexual encounter with himself and another man.\r\nThe events making up that encounter were largely undisputed; what was disputed was\r\nwhether Clark consented. There was little if any physical evidence of non-consent. The\r\nState’s primary evidence of guilt, rather, was Clark’s own testimony that she did not\r\nconsent. Gagne sought to discredit that testimony with evidence that—only one month\r\nbefore the subject incident—Clark had voluntarily engaged in three-way sex with Gagne\r\nand another man, and that she had suggested the same thing on another occasion. That\r\nevidence would have included testimony not only from Gagne, but also from Ruben\r\nBermudez, the other participant in the three-way the month before, who according to\r\nGagne’s lawyer was prepared to testify at trial. See 1/2/01 Hearing Tr. 18-19. But the\r\ntrial court excluded all of that testimony. That exclusion was affirmed by the state court\r\nof appeals, which held—remarkably—that the excluded testimony was not even relevant\r\nto the case.\r\n\r\n        That the excluded evidence was highly relevant can be inferred, as discussed\r\nabove, from the rape-shield statutes themselves. Moreover, as Judge Norris explains,\r\nin both this case and Crane the excluded evidence, if credited, answers a question that,\r\nif left unanswered, leads directly to conviction. See Maj. Op. at 15-16.\r\n\r\n        The State says the trial court’s admission of evidence of another sexual\r\nencounter—the so-called Tony’s Lounge incident, which involved five people—made\r\nthe three-way evidence only marginal, rather than central, to Gagne’s defense. But the\r\nprosecution itself did a credible job of explaining, in closing argument, why the Tony’s\r\nLounge evidence did very little to answer the question described above. I think that\r\nJudge Norris’s opinion convincingly finishes the job.\r\n\r\n        What is significant is the effect of the Tony’s Lounge evidence upon the State’s\r\ninterest in excluding the Gagne and Bermudez three-way testimony. This, in my view,\r\n\fNo. 07-1970        Gagne v. Booker                                                Page 22\r\n\r\n\r\nis where the bottom falls out of the State’s argument on appeal. As an initial matter, this\r\ncase only weakly implicates the interests protected by Michigan’s rape-shield statute,\r\nsince the statute’s terms did not even bar the excluded testimony, but instead left its\r\nadmission to the discretion of the Ingham County Circuit Judge. See Mich. Comp. Laws\r\n§ 750.520j(1)(a). And it is hard to see what was left of those interests, such as they were\r\nin this case, given the evidence that was admitted at trial. That evidence included that,\r\nduring the Tony’s Lounge incident, Clark had engaged in oral sex with Swathwood\r\nshortly after intercourse with Gagne, and that she had engaged in consensual oral sex\r\nwith Gagne minutes before the very incident for which he was convicted (and moreover\r\nthat she had drunk a pint of vodka and nine or so beers and smoked crack in the hours\r\nbefore the incident). I entirely agree that Michigan’s rape-shield law protects important\r\nstate interests in the vast majority of cases in which it is implicated. But I submit that,\r\nunder the circumstances of this trial, there was virtually nothing left of those interests\r\nto protect.\r\n\r\n        So here, as in Crane, the prosecution’s case hinged on a single account of what\r\nhappened during the underlying incident. In each case, the nature of that account—a\r\nconfession there, and the outlandish conduct alleged to have been coerced here—tended\r\nto make the account especially persuasive to a jury. In each case, the trial court excluded\r\nhighly relevant evidence that, if credited, could have undermined the account upon\r\nwhich the State relied. And in each case the State’s interest in excluding that evidence\r\nwas negligible.\r\n\r\n        These parallels emerge, admittedly, only after close analysis. But I think they\r\nare clear enough to render the state court’s decision unreasonable within the meaning of\r\nthe habeas statute. (It bears mention that two Justices of the Michigan Supreme Court\r\nvoted to reverse the decision summarily, and that Justice Markman voted to hear the\r\ncase. See 673 N.W.2d 755 (Mich. 2003) (unpublished table disposition).) The exclusion\r\nof the three-way evidence clearly violated Gagne’s Sixth Amendment and procedural\r\ndue process rights. He should have been able to present that evidence to a jury before\r\nultimately being sentenced to a prison term of up to 45 years.\r\n\fNo. 07-1970        Gagne v. Booker                                                 Page 23\r\n\r\n\r\n        My purpose in reciting this evidence, however, is not to explain what Judge\r\nNorris has already explained in his nuanced opinion. And I readily admit that reasonable\r\npeople, including the respected Chief Judge of our court, can disagree with my\r\nconclusion in this case. Nor do I mean to “pass on the strength or merits” of Gagne’s\r\ndefense. Crane, 476 U.S. at 691. I think those merits should have been left to the jury;\r\nand otherwise I do not hold a torch for anyone involved in the underlying events of this\r\ncase.\r\n\r\n        My purpose, instead, is to emphasize the limited nature of our holding in this\r\ncase. See also Maj. Op. at 16-17. With respect, I do not think that holding has nearly\r\nthe jurisprudential consequences that Michigan and the amici States seem to think it has.\r\n\r\n        For these reasons, I continue to concur fully in Judge Norris’s opinion.\r\n\fNo. 07-1970           Gagne v.

BATCHELDER, Chief Judge, dissenting. Some 35 years ago, the\r\nMichigan state legislature determined that a criminal defendant accused of rape may not\r\nintroduce evidence about the victim’s past sexual behavior, because the victim’s past\r\nwillingness is not relevant to the question of present consent. The majority here\r\ndisagrees with that legislative determination and concludes that evidence of the victim’s\r\npromiscuity or previous willingness to engage in somewhat similar sex acts was not only\r\nrelevant but was “indispensable” and “the most relevant evidence.” Moreover, because\r\nthis appeal arises in the context of a habeas proceeding, the majority ultimately holds\r\nthat the rape defendant has a “constitutionally protected” and “clearly established” right\r\nto introduce this evidence. In so holding, the majority effectively abrogates every rape-\r\nshield statute in this circuit.1 I do not believe that there is any such constitutional right\r\nto present evidence of a rape victim’s promiscuity or past willingness to engage in sex\r\nacts, nor do I believe that the majority is justified in its condemnation of the rape-shield\r\nconcept. I dissent.\r\n\r\n                                                  A.\r\n\r\n         In concluding its analysis, and justifying its grant of habeas relief, the majority\r\ncites Crane v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 683 (1986), as the “clearly established law” that the\r\nMichigan Court of Appeals “unreasonably applied.” See Maj. Op. at 17 (“We therefore\r\nconclude that the state appellate court’s determination on this issue was an unreasonable\r\napplication of the principles set forth by the Supreme Court in Crane.”). The majority\r\noffers the following exposition of those “principles”:\r\n\r\n         Crane makes clear that a proper inquiry into the constitutionality of a\r\n         court’s decision to exclude evidence begins with considering the\r\n\r\n\r\n         1\r\n           See Fed. R. Evid. 412 (108 Stat. 1919, eff. Sept. 13, 1994); Tenn. R. Evid. 412 (adopted July\r\n1, 1991, to replace T.C.A. § 40-17-119); Ky. R. Evid. (1990 c 88 § 22, eff. Mar. 16, 1990); Ohio Rev.\r\nCode § 2907.02(D) (1975 S 144, eff. Aug. 27, 1975); Mich. Comp. L. § 750.520j (P.A. 1974, No. 266 § 1,\r\neff. Apr. 1, 1975).\r\n\fNo. 07-1970         Gagne v. Booker                                               Page 25\r\n\r\n\r\n        relevancy and cumulative nature of the excluded evidence, and the extent\r\n        to which it was ‘central’ or ‘indispensable’ to the defense. Against this\r\n        courts must balance the state’s interests in enforcing the evidentiary rule\r\n        on which the exclusion was based, in this case Michigan’s rape shield\r\n        statute.\r\n\r\nMaj. Op. at 9 (underlining added) (citing Crane, 476 U.S. at 691). So, according to the\r\nmajority, Crane stands for the clear proposition that if a defendant accused of rape can\r\nshow that evidence of the rape victim’s promiscuity or prior willingness to perform sex\r\nacts is “highly relevant, non-cumulative, and indispensable to the central dispute in a\r\ncriminal trial,” then that defendant has a constitutional right to “put [that evidence]\r\nbefore the jury.” Maj. Op. at 16.\r\n\r\n        I cannot accept this proposition. Foremost, I do not agree with its constitutional\r\npremise. That is, in light of Michigan v. Lucas, 500 U.S. 145 (1991), I do not believe\r\nthat there is any such constitutional right. But, even if I am mistaken in my reading of\r\nLucas, I cannot agree that this proposition was — or, indeed, is now — “clearly\r\nestablished” as Supreme Court precedent, and I do not agree that such a liberal extension\r\nof Crane is justified (or justifiable). Moreover, I cannot agree that the Michigan Court\r\nof Appeals’s application of these governing principles (such as they are) was\r\n“objectively unreasonable.” Finally, I am simply unwilling to sanction the inevitable,\r\nalbeit unacknowledged, consequence of this decision — that rape-shield statutes are ipso\r\nfacto unconstitutional, inasmuch as their very purpose is to exclude, on policy grounds,\r\nevidence that is almost always “highly relevant, non-cumulative, and indispensable to\r\nthe central dispute in a criminal trial.”\r\n\r\n                                            1.\r\n\r\n        In Lucas, 500 U.S. at 147, the Michigan prosecutor charged Nolan Lucas with\r\ncriminal sexual conduct based on his ex-girlfriend’s accusation that he forced her to his\r\napartment at knife point and forced her to perform various sex acts against her will. Id.\r\nat 147. Lucas and the ex-girlfriend had ended a six-to-seven month relationship just two\r\nweeks earlier and Lucas insisted that the entire episode was consensual, that he had not\r\nused a knife or any other force. See Michigan v. Lucas, 408 N.W.2d 431, 431-32 (Mich.\r\n\fNo. 07-1970        Gagne v. Booker                                                Page 26\r\n\r\n\r\nApp. 1987). At trial, the ex-girlfriend claimed rape and Lucas claimed consent. See\r\nMichigan v. Lucas, 469 N.W.2d 435, 436 (Mich. App. 1991) (“Virtually all of the\r\nevidence in this case consisted of complainant’s word against the word of defendant.”).\r\n\r\n       At trial, Lucas’s counsel sought to introduce testimony regarding the couple’s\r\nrelationship — specifically, their sexual history — as evidence of consent, but the state\r\nobjected on the basis that defense counsel had not given prior notice of its intent to use\r\nthat evidence, as was required by the Michigan rape-shield statute, M.C.L. §750.520j.\r\nSee Lucas, 500 U.S. at 147. The trial court agreed that Lucas’s counsel had failed to\r\ncomply with the notice provision of the rape-shield statute and refused to admit the\r\nevidence. Id. at 148.\r\n\r\n       After being convicted and sentenced, Lucas appealed. Id. The Michigan Court\r\nof Appeals vacated the conviction, holding “that the [Michigan rape-shield statute]’s\r\nnotice-and-hearing requirement is unconstitutional in all cases where it is used to\r\npreclude evidence of past sexual conduct between a rape victim and a criminal\r\ndefendant.” Id. The United State Supreme Court granted certiorari to decide this\r\nconstitutional question and ultimately concluded:\r\n\r\n       [T]he Michigan Court of Appeals erred in adopting a per se rule that\r\n       Michigan’s notice-and-hearing requirement violates the Sixth\r\n       Amendment in all cases where it is used to preclude evidence of past\r\n       sexual conduct between a rape victim and a defendant. The Sixth\r\n       Amendment is not so rigid. The notice-and-hearing requirement serves\r\n       legitimate state interests in protecting against surprise, harassment, and\r\n       undue delay. Failure to comply with this requirement may in some cases\r\n       justify even the severe sanction of preclusion.\r\n\r\nId. at 152-53. The Supreme Court vacated the judgment and remanded the case, stating:\r\n\r\n       We leave it to the Michigan courts to address in the first instance whether\r\n       Michigan’s rape-shield statute authorizes preclusion and whether, on the\r\n       facts of this case, preclusion violated Lucas’ rights under the Sixth\r\n       Amendment.\r\nId. at 153. So, the Supreme Court expressly did not decide the preclusion question,\r\nwhich is the question before us here. And, the inescapable consequence of this non-\r\n\fNo. 07-1970         Gagne v. Booker                                                Page 27\r\n\r\n\r\ndecision — the avoidance of this particular question — is that the Court has not\r\narticulated any “clearly established” law on this issue.\r\n\r\n        In the present case, however, the Michigan courts did consider whether\r\nMichigan’s rape-shield statute authorizes preclusion and determined, on the facts of this\r\ncase, that preclusion of certain testimony concerning Ms. Clark’s alleged prior sexual\r\nactivities did not violate defendant Gagne’s rights under the Sixth Amendment. Because\r\nthe Lucas Court had left this issue unresolved, Lucas offers little direct guidance on this\r\nissue (i.e., Lucas did not “clearly establish” any law on this particular issue), but it\r\ncertainly offers some guidance, the most telling of which comes from what it did not\r\nhold.\r\n\r\n        The Lucas Court did not hold what the majority holds today — that a defendant\r\nhas a constitutional right to put evidence before the jury because the evidence was highly\r\nrelevant, non-cumulative, and indispensable to the central dispute. If the evidence at\r\nissue in the present case was highly relevant, non-cumulative, and indispensable to the\r\ncentral dispute, then the evidence in Lucas was equally or more so. In the present case,\r\nthe evidence concerned the victim’s alleged willingness to participate in a particular\r\nsexual practice on at least two prior occasions; in Lucas, the evidence concerned the\r\nvictim’s six-to-seven month relationship with the defendant, the emotional, physical, and\r\nsexual nature of their relationship, and the patterns and practices incident thereto. If the\r\nformer is “highly relevant,” then so must be the latter. In the present case, the court\r\nexcluded two incidents of prior sexual activities, but admitted testimony about three\r\nothers; in Lucas, the court excluded any reference whatsoever to the prior sexual\r\nrelationship. If the former is “non-cumulative,” so must be the latter. And, finally, the\r\ncentral issue in the present case was the defendant’s asserted defense of consent, which\r\nwas also the central issue in Lucas. If evidence concerning consent in the former is\r\n“indispensable to the central dispute,” so it must be in the latter.\r\n\r\n        So, it bears emphasizing that even though the evidence in Lucas was clearly\r\n“highly relevant, non-cumulative, and indispensable to the central dispute in a criminal\r\ntrial,” see Maj. Op. at 16, the Lucas Court did not hold — and did not even suggest —\r\n\fNo. 07-1970           Gagne v. Booker                                                 Page 28\r\n\r\n\r\nthat the defendant therefore had some over-arching constitutional right to “put [that\r\nevidence] before the jury,” see Maj. Op. at 16. In fact, the Lucas Court implicitly\r\nrejected any such right, holding instead that the defendant’s “[f]ailure to comply with\r\n[the notice] requirement may in some cases justify even the severe sanction of\r\npreclu[ding]” such highly relevant, non-cumulative, and indispensable evidence. See\r\nLucas, 500 U.S. at 153. It is perhaps just as important that the Lucas Court expressly left\r\nit to the Michigan courts to decide “whether, on the facts of this case, preclusion [of the\r\npropensity evidence] violated Lucas’ rights under the Sixth Amendment.” See id. The\r\nmajority notes that “rape shield laws, including Michigan’s, almost universally except\r\nfrom this rule evidence regarding prior sexual activity between the complainant and the\r\ndefendant, precisely because that evidence carries heightened relevancy due to its\r\nincreased similarity to the instance of the alleged rape.” Maj. Op. at 13 (emphasis in\r\noriginal). But in Lucas, it was exactly that type of sexual-history evidence that had been\r\nprecluded.\r\n\r\n          So, the clear implication of Lucas is that the trial court can, without running afoul\r\nof the Constitution, exclude highly relevant, non-cumulative, and indispensable evidence\r\nfrom a criminal defendant’s trial. That is, Lucas clearly demonstrates that a court can\r\nconstitutionally exclude such evidence on the basis that the defendant’s attorney failed\r\nto comply with the statute’s notice requirement. Therefore, the right (such as it is) to put\r\nthat evidence before the jury is not grounded in the Constitution, but is instead grounded\r\nin state law or the state’s proper application of that law. Cf. Dist. Atty.’s Office for the\r\nThird Judicial Dist. v. Osborne, 557 U.S. --, 129 S. Ct. 2308, 2320 (2009) (holding that\r\nthere is no stand-alone constitutional right to access evidence for purposes of DNA\r\ntesting, there is at most a constitutional right to the proper application of a state-created\r\nright).\r\n\r\n          The majority’s proposition cannot survive Lucas. While the Supreme Court has\r\nleft its Sixth Amendment analysis unarticulated post-Lucas, it is evident from the\r\nforegoing that whatever the proper analysis may be, the majority’s (unprecedented)\r\nproposition does not conform to it.\r\n\fNo. 07-1970        Gagne v. Booker                                                Page 29\r\n\r\n\r\n                                           2.\r\n\r\n       The majority’s holding is premised on Crane v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 683, 684\r\n(1986), a case in which a 16-year-old defendant was implicated in the murder of a liquor\r\nstore clerk and signed a confession at the police station. At the boy’s trial, the court\r\nrefused to admit evidence about the circumstances surrounding his confession — “that\r\nhe had been detained in a windowless room for a protracted period of time . . .\r\nsurrounded by as many as six police officers. . . , that he had repeatedly requested and\r\nbeen denied permission to telephone his mother, and that he had been badgered into\r\nmaking a false confession.” Id. at 685. The jury convicted him of the murder and the\r\ncourt sentenced him to 40 years in prison. Id. On appeal to the Supreme Court, the\r\nCourt reversed the conviction on constitutional grounds. Id. at 687.\r\n\r\n       The Court explained that, while a pre-trial confession is “not conclusive of guilt,”\r\nit certainly changes the complexion of the defense and invariably raises “the one\r\nquestion every rational juror needs answered: If the defendant is innocent, why did he\r\npreviously admit his guilt?” Id. at 689. Thus, the Court explained, such “a defendant’s\r\ncase may stand or fall on his ability to convince the jury that the manner in which the\r\nconfession was obtained casts doubt on its credibility.” Id.\r\n\r\n                This simple insight is reflected in a federal statute, 18 U.S.C.\r\n       § 3501(a), the Federal Rules of Evidence, Fed. Rule Evid. 104(e), and the\r\n       statutory and decisional law of virtually every State in the Nation\r\n       [citations omitted]. We recognize, of course, that under our federal\r\n       system even a consensus as broad as this one is not inevitably congruent\r\n       with the dictates of the Constitution. We acknowledge also our\r\n       traditional reluctance to impose constitutional constraints on ordinary\r\n       evidentiary rulings by state trial courts. In any given criminal case the\r\n       trial judge is called upon to make dozens, sometimes hundreds, of\r\n       decisions concerning the admissibility of evidence. As we reaffirmed\r\n       earlier this Term, the Constitution leaves to the judges who must make\r\n       these decisions wide latitude to exclude evidence that is repetitive, only\r\n       marginally relevant[,] or poses an undue risk of harassment, prejudice,\r\n       or confusion of the issues. Moreover, we have never questioned the\r\n       power of States to exclude evidence through the application of\r\n       evidentiary rules that themselves serve the interests of fairness and\r\n       reliability — even if the defendant would prefer to see that evidence\r\n       admitted. Nonetheless, without signaling any diminution in the respect\r\n\fNo. 07-1970         Gagne v. Booker                                               Page 30\r\n\r\n\r\n       traditionally accorded to the States in the establishment and\r\n       implementation of their own criminal trial rules and procedures, we have\r\n       little trouble concluding on the facts of this case that the blanket\r\n       exclusion of the proffered testimony about the circumstances of\r\n       petitioner’s confession deprived him of a fair trial.\r\n\r\nId. at 689-90 (citations, quotation and editorial marks omitted; emphasis added).\r\n\r\n       Thus, the clear proposition for which Crane stands is that when a criminal\r\ndefendant, having signed a confession, nonetheless proceeds to trial, the Constitution\r\nguarantees that defendant the right to present evidence (i.e., the right to be heard) about\r\nthe circumstances surrounding the confession, so that he may present a complete defense\r\nby challenging the credibility of that pre-trial confession. A broader application is not\r\nevident (or inevitable) from the text of the Crane opinion.\r\n\r\n       In Holmes v. South Carolina, 547 U.S. 319 (2006) — a case the majority cites\r\nin support of Crane — the Supreme Court characterized Crane as a case about an\r\n“arbitrary” rule:\r\n\r\n       Another arbitrary rule was held unconstitutional in Crane v. Kentucky,\r\n       [476 U.S. 683 (1986)]. There, the defendant was prevented from\r\n       attempting to show at trial that his confession was unreliable because of\r\n       the circumstances under which it was obtained, and neither the\r\n       [Kentucky] State Supreme Court nor the prosecution ‘advanced any\r\n       rational justification for the wholesale exclusion of this body of\r\n       potentially exculpatory evidence.’ Id. at 691.\r\n\r\nHolmes, 547 U.S. at 326. It is noteworthy that, although it cited Holmes, the majority\r\nhere did not hold that the Michigan rape-shield statute is “arbitrary” or that the Michigan\r\nCourt of Appeals failed to “advance[] any rational justification” for its exclusion of the\r\nsexual propensity evidence.\r\n\r\n       The majority cites Crane as the “clearly established law” that the Michigan Court\r\nof Appeals “unreasonably applied” in this case. See Maj. Op. at 17 (“We therefore\r\nconclude that the state appellate court’s determination on this issue was an unreasonable\r\napplication of the principles set forth by the Supreme Court in Crane.”). That is, the\r\nmajority views Crane — a decision that upheld a criminal defendant’s constitutional\r\n\fNo. 07-1970         Gagne v. Booker                                                 Page 31\r\n\r\n\r\nright to introduce evidence about the circumstances surrounding his own (allegedly\r\ncoerced) pre-trial confession — as the “clearly established” or governing law on the\r\nconstitutionality of a criminal defendant’s right to introduce evidence about the victim’s\r\nprior willingness to participate in certain private, potentially humiliating, sex acts, based\r\non the defendant’s theory that her previous willingness would be indicative of her\r\ncurrent willingness.\r\n\r\n        I do not agree that the majority’s rendition of Crane is or was “clearly\r\nestablished.” In my view, the majority has extended Crane well beyond any reading or\r\napplication justified by the language of the opinion or any subsequent case. It is unfair\r\nto fault the Michigan Court of Appeals, as the majority does, for failing to anticipate this\r\nnovel extension of Crane.\r\n\r\n                                             3.\r\n\r\n        The majority’s approach does not comply with the limitations of AEDPA. Under\r\nAEDPA, the phrase “unreasonable application of” Supreme Court precedent means that\r\nthe state court “identifie[d] the correct governing legal principle from [Supreme Court]\r\ndecisions but unreasonably applie[d] that principle to the facts” of the case. Williams\r\nv. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362, 413 (2000). But, “a federal habeas court may not issue the writ\r\nsimply because [it] concludes in its independent judgment that the relevant state-court\r\ndecision applied clearly established federal law erroneously or incorrectly.” Lockyer v.\r\nAndrade, 538 U.S. 63, 75-76 (2003) (quoting Williams, 529 U.S. at 411). Even “a firm\r\nconviction that the state court was erroneous” is not enough. Id. at 75 (quotation marks\r\nomitted; emphasis added). Rather, “[t]he state court’s application of clearly established\r\nlaw must be objectively unreasonable.” Id. at 76 (emphasis added); see also Wright v.\r\nVan Patten, 552 U.S. 120, 128 S. Ct. 743, 747 (2008) (“Because our cases give no clear\r\nanswer to the question presented, let alone one in [petitioner]’s favor, it cannot be said\r\nthat the state court unreasonably applied clearly established Federal law.” (quotation\r\nmarks and citations omitted)).\r\n\fNo. 07-1970         Gagne v. Booker                                               Page 32\r\n\r\n\r\n        A review of the Michigan Court of Appeals’ decision reveals that its application,\r\nfar from being “objectively unreasonable,” was eminently reasonable. The court\r\nexplained its approach:\r\n\r\n               Evidence of specific instances of a victim’s past sexual conduct\r\n        with others is generally legally irrelevant and inadmissible under the\r\n        rape-shield statute, M.C.L. § 750.520j. In certain limited situations,\r\n        evidence that does not come within the specific exceptions of the statute\r\n        may be relevant and its admission required to preserve a criminal\r\n        defendant’s Sixth Amendment right of confrontation. . . .\r\n               Inquiries into sex histories, even when minimally relevant, carry\r\n        a danger of unfairly prejudicing and misleading the jury. Application of\r\n        the rape-shield statute must be done on a case-by-case basis, and the\r\n        balance between the rights of the victim and the defendant must be\r\n        weighed anew in each case. In exercising its discretion, the trial court\r\n        should be mindful of the significant legislative purposes underlying the\r\n        rape-shield statute and should always favor exclusion of evidence of a\r\n        complainant’s sexual conduct where its exclusion would not\r\n        unconstitutionally abridge the defendant’s right to confrontation.\r\n\r\nMichigan v. Swathwood, No. 235540 & 235541, 2003 WL 1880143, *1 (Mich. App.\r\nApr. 15, 2003) (citations and quotations marks omitted). The court considered the\r\nevidence and, concluding that evidence of Ms. Clark’s propensity to participate in\r\ncertain sex acts was not probative of whether she consented to the acts complained of\r\nin the present case, affirmed the trial court. Id. at *2-4.\r\n\r\n        I cannot agree that the Michigan Court of Appeals’s application of the governing\r\nprinciples was “objectively unreasonable.” It appears to me that the majority does not\r\ndispute the state court’s application of the law so much as it simply disagrees with either\r\nthe Michigan legislature’s policy determination about the relevance of this propensity\r\nevidence or with the state court’s measure of the probity or relevance of this evidence.\r\nNeither is a proper basis for habeas relief.\r\n\fNo. 07-1970        Gagne v. Booker                                                Page 33\r\n\r\n\r\n                                           4.\r\n\r\n       It is commonly understood that the uncorroborated testimony of a rape victim is\r\nsufficient to support a conviction. See Tibbs v. Florida, 457 U.S. 31, 45 n.21 (1982);\r\nBrown v. Davis, 752 F.2d 1142, 1144 (6th Cir. 1985) (holding that the testimony of a\r\nsingle, uncorroborated rape victim is sufficient to support conviction); Michigan v.\r\nWhittaker, 2007 WL 914342, *5 (Mich. App. Mar. 27, 2007) (“Indeed, in cases of sexual\r\nassault, a conviction may ‘be based upon the uncorroborated testimony of the woman\r\nassaulted.’”) (quoting Michigan v. Miller, 55 NW 675, 676 (Mich. 1893)); M.C.L.\r\n§750.520h (“The testimony of a victim need not be corroborated in [rape and sexual\r\nassault] prosecutions under sections 520b to 520g.”). But, the majority is not so easily\r\npersuaded.\r\n\r\n       The defense’s theory was that Clark consented to the activities of July 3,\r\n       but it had only the Tony’s Lounge incident as evidence that she may have\r\n       done so. In our view, the exclusion of the evidence of the group sexual\r\n       activity with Bermudez and the invitation to Gagne’s father were\r\n       indispensable to the jury’s ability to assess the likelihood of this theory.\r\n       We cannot accurately portray the extent of Gagne’s interest in presenting\r\n       this evidence without reference to the lack of other evidence in this case.\r\n       Other than the two defendants and the complainant, there were no\r\n       eyewitnesses at all. Nor did the physical evidence tend weigh in favor\r\n       of one side or the other. In short, the excluded evidence was not just\r\n       relevant to this case, it was in all likelihood the most relevant evidence\r\n       regarding the sole contested issue at trial — an issue about which there\r\n       was not much evidence in the first place. We believe it was\r\n       indispensable to the defense’s theory . . . .\r\n\r\nMaj. Op. at 14-15 (paragraph break and footnote omitted).\r\n\r\n       First, let’s be very clear about what the majority means when it says “evidence\r\nof the group sexual activity with Bermudez and the invitation to Gagne’s father.” This\r\n“evidence” is simply Gagne’s uncorroborated testimony about these alleged incidents.\r\nNo one contends that either Bermudez or Gagne’s father was prepared to testify about\r\nthese incidents, or that there was any other “proof.” And Clark was prepared to refute\r\nthese accusations, had Gagne been allowed to raise them.\r\n\fNo. 07-1970         Gagne v. Booker                                                 Page 34\r\n\r\n\r\n        And, it bears emphasizing that the defense did not have “only the Tony’s Lounge\r\nincident as evidence” that “Clark consented to the activities of July 3”; the defense had\r\ntestimony by both Gagne and Swathwood — which is twice as much testimony as a rape\r\ndefendant would typically have — and an opportunity to cross-examine the sole\r\ncomplainant, Pamela Clark. Moreover, the “lack of other evidence” did not hinder\r\nGagne’s defense; if anything it hindered the prosecution, whose burden it was to prove\r\nthe offense beyond a reasonable doubt.\r\n\r\n        So, the majority is really saying that despite the absence of physical evidence,\r\nand despite Gagne’s and Swathwood’s consistent testimony that Clark consented, and\r\ndespite their consistent testimony about the Tony’s Lounge incident, and despite defense\r\ncounsel’s opportunity to cross-examine Clark at length — Gagne’s self-serving and\r\nunverifiable testimony about those two other past, unrelated incidents of sexual\r\ndebauchery on the part of his accuser, Pamela Clark, was “indispensable to the jury’s\r\nability to assess the likelihood” that she had consented to the far more violent and\r\nhumiliating form of sexual debauchery with Gagne and Swathwood on the night in\r\nquestion. The majority contends: “the excluded evidence was not just relevant to this\r\ncase, it was in all likelihood the most relevant evidence regarding the sole contested\r\nissue at trial,” consent.\r\n\r\n        So, the majority’s position is that “the most relevant evidence” in a rape trial, the\r\n“indispensable” evidence, is the perpetrator’s testimony about the victim’s promiscuity\r\nor prior sex acts. And this, according to the majority, is because a rape defendant has\r\na constitutional right to prove present consent by producing evidence of past willingness,\r\nat least insofar as the defendant can characterize that evidence as highly relevant, non-\r\ncumulative, and central to the dispute.\r\n\r\n        I disagree and find that I am not alone. In Sandoval v. Acevedo, 996 F.2d 145,\r\n147-48 (7th Cir. 1993), the Seventh Circuit decided a case in which the defendant —\r\naccused of forcibly sodomizing his ex-girlfriend — sought to introduce testimony by\r\nother men that she had enjoyed anal intercourse with them in the past, thus\r\ndemonstrating her propensity for it. The court explained:\r\n\fNo. 07-1970        Gagne v. Booker                                                Page 35\r\n\r\n\r\n        The essential insight behind the rape shield statute is that in an age of\r\n        post-Victorian sexual practice, in which most unmarried young women\r\n        are sexually active, the fact that a woman has voluntarily engaged in a\r\n        particular sexual activity on previous occasions does not provide\r\n        appreciable support for an inference that she consented to engage in this\r\n        activity with the defendant on the occasion on which she claims that she\r\n        was raped. And allowing defense counsel to spread the details of a\r\n        woman’s sex life on the public record not only causes embarrassment to\r\n        the woman but by doing so makes it less likely that victims of rape will\r\n        press charges.\r\n\r\nId. at 149. The Seventh Circuit continued:\r\n\r\n        The fact that [she] had had pleasurable anal intercourse with another man\r\n        on another occasion would not show that she would have enjoyed having\r\n        it with Sandoval on an occasion when he was enraged and wanted by\r\n        penetrating her anally to humiliate and, quite possibly, physically hurt\r\n        her. Indeed, by that logic rape shield laws would be unconstitutional to\r\n        the core because their central aim is to prevent the drawing of an\r\n        inference of consent from previous consensual intercourse with other\r\n        men.\r\n\r\nId. at 151.\r\n\r\n        [E]ven without a rape shield law it is doubtful that testimony that she had\r\n        enjoyed it with another man would be admissible, for it doesn’t, or at\r\n        least shouldn’t, require a rape shield law to show that consent to sex with\r\n        X on one occasion is not good evidence of consent to sex with Y on\r\n        another.\r\n\r\nId. To extend this basic reasoning to the present case: it shouldn’t require a rape shield\r\nlaw to show that consent to sex with X and Y on one occasion is not good evidence of\r\nconsent to sex with X and Z on another. But, as so many states have discovered, it does\r\nrequire a rape-shield law, because too many people — like the majority here — succumb\r\nto the “propensity evidence” problem.\r\n\r\n        There is, to be sure, a commonplace assumption behind propensity evidence: If\r\nshe did it before, she’s more likely to have done it again. Cf., e.g., Old Chief v. United\r\nStates, 519 U.S. 172, 181 (1997); Fed. R. Evid. 404(b). And there is a peculiar aspect\r\nto propensity evidence in rape cases, in which evidence of the victim’s sexual\r\n\fNo. 07-1970        Gagne v. Booker                                                Page 36\r\n\r\n\r\npredilections — e.g., a propensity for sexual willingness — has historically been\r\nconsidered indicative of whether the victim consented to the incident in question. See\r\nFed. R. Evid. 412. And this is an assumption that the Michigan legislature (like many\r\nothers across the country) was attempting to overcome by enacting its rape shield statute.\r\n\r\n       The Michigan legislature has declared such evidence generally inadmissible as\r\na matter of public policy: that rape victims should be encouraged to report and prosecute\r\nrapes without fear that private, potentially embarrassing, incidents from their past will\r\nbecome the centerpiece of the ensuing trial. The majority disagrees and holds that the\r\nrape-shield statute is no bar to evidence of a rape victim’s promiscuity or prior\r\nwillingness to engage in sexual debauchery, if that evidence is “highly relevant, non-\r\ncumulative, and indispensable to the central dispute in a criminal trial.”\r\n\r\n       But, as the Seventh Circuit stated so cogently, “by that logic rape shield laws\r\nwould be unconstitutional to the core,” see Sandoval, 996 F.2d at 151, inasmuch as the\r\nvery purpose of a rape-shield statute is to exclude, on policy grounds, evidence that is\r\nalmost always highly relevant, non-cumulative, and indispensable to the central dispute\r\nin a criminal trial.    If the majority wants to hold that rape-shield statutes are\r\nunconstitutional, it should do so forthrightly. At least, that way, we would have the issue\r\nfront and center, with an opportunity for debate and dissent.\r\n\r\n                                            B.\r\n\r\n       I cannot agree that the Michigan Court of Appeals unreasonably applied any\r\nclearly established law, and I cannot join the majority opinion which, in effect,\r\ninvalidates all rape shield laws as violative of the Sixth Amendment. Therefore, I\r\nrespectfully dissent. I would reverse the district court’s judgment and deny the\r\npetitioner’s request for habeas relief.\r\n\f",

BATCHELDER, C.J. (pp. 292-301), delivered a separate dissenting opinion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>AMENDED OPINION</h2>\n<p>ALAN E. NORRIS, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>Petitioner Lewis Gagne and his co-defendant, Donald Swathwood, were each charged with three counts of criminal sexual misconduct for forcibly and simultaneously engaging in sexual activities with Gagne's ex-girlfriend, Pamela Clark. All of the charges arose out of events occurring over the course of one night. The key question at trial was one of consent. The jury convicted Gagne of two counts, and Swathwood of three. Gagne filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, 28 U.S.C. § 2254, and the district court granted him relief on the basis that the state trial court's decision to exclude certain evidence had violated Gagne's due process right to present a meaningful defense. Respondent, Warden Raymond Booker, represented by the Michigan Attorney General (\"the State\"), appealed. We now affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A.</h2>\n<p>Gagne and Swathwood were each charged with three counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct. Mich. Comp. Laws § 750.520b(1)(f).<sup>[1]</sup> Gagne's three <span class=\"star-pagination\">*280</span> charges included two counts of forcible penis to mouth penetration and one count of forcible penis to vagina penetration, charges for which consent is a full defense. <i>See </i><i>People v. Waltonen,</i> 272 Mich.App. 678, 728 N.W.2d 881, 887 (2006), <i>appeal denied,</i> 478 Mich. 866, 731 N.W.2d 718 (2007); <i>see also </i><i>People v. Hearn,</i> 100 Mich.App. 749, 300 N.W.2d 396, 398 (1980). A jury convicted Gagne of forcible vaginal penetration and of one count of forcible oral penetration.</p>\n<p>The parties do not dispute the background facts that set the stage for what occurred on the night of July 3, 2000. The complainant, Clark, and Gagne dated from some time in January until early June of that year. Gagne moved in with Clark in late January or early February, and the two lived together until their relationship ended. Throughout this time, Clark worked, but Gagne did not, and Gagne would frequently use her work phone and her personal ATM card, sometimes without her knowledge.</p>\n<p>Also undisputed were the events that took place around midnight on July 3, 2000. After spending most of that day doing yardwork, during which time she consumed most of a pint of vodka, Clark retired to her house to watch television. Gagne arrived uninvited at about 10:45 p.m. He informed Clark that he and his friend Swathwood, whom Clark also knew, were going to move to California. Shortly thereafter Swathwood and a third man, Michael Stout, arrived. The group began drinking beer and possibly smoking marijuana. By Clark's own estimate she consumed nine or ten beers during this time.</p>\n<p>This point in the story marks the beginning of the facts contested at trial. We begin with the version urged by the prosecution, which was presented almost entirely through Clark's testimony. At some point after midnight, Clark and Gagne took a shower together. Afterwards, Clark, who believed that Swathwood and Stout had left, participated in oral sex with Gagne in the living room. Swathwood entered the room and began engaging in intercourse with her while Gagne forcibly held her head down. A few minutes later, Gagne released Clark and the two went into the bedroom where Clark told Gagne she did not want to have sex with Swathwood. Clark then began performing oral sex with Gagne. Swathwood again entered the room and began engaging in intercourse with her. The men held Clark down, and each had intercourse and oral sex with her, at various points slapping her buttocks and using sexual devices that Clark kept in her room.</p>\n<p>At approximately five a.m. the men tired of this activity and left the room. Clark went into the bathroom, vomited, took a shower, and returned to bed where she slept until approximately noon the next day. At that time she discovered her ATM card was missing, and upon further investigation learned that at 5:28 that morning someone had withdrawn $300 from her account, and had tried to withdraw more money twice in the following fifteen minutes.</p>\n<p>The defense's version of events differed primarily on the issue of consent. According to Gagne and Swathwood, the group purchased and smoked some crack cocaine at around midnight. Clark then began talking with the men about engaging in group sex, and in large part instigated the group sexual activity, first in the living room and then later in the bedroom. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*281</span> Their description of the sexual activities differed only in that Clark consented to them. They concede for instance, that they spanked Clark. At about five a.m. Gagne and Clark agreed that Gagne should leave and purchase more crack with money withdrawn using her ATM card. All three men left in Clark's car. Gagne dropped Stout off at home, withdrew $300 from an ATM using Clark's card, and then drove to a street corner and purchased crack. The defendants became nervous when they saw police cars in the area, so instead of returning home, they drove to a cemetery and smoked the crack. The defendants testified that they returned to Clark's house later that morning and Gagne returned her ATM card. Clark was angry and told Gagne to leave, so he did.</p>\n<p>Clark testified that, two days later, she told her adult son that she had been raped. She also told the police, and saw several doctors. The doctors noted that she had some bruising but no trauma to her wrists or shoulders, which are typically present after a sexual assault. Nor did any of the doctors find any internal or external tears to Clark's vagina or rectum.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B.</h2>\n<p>As noted above, at the heart of Gagne's petition for habeas corpus is the trial judge's exclusion of certain evidence from the trial. As required by the Michigan rape shield law, Mich. Comp. Laws § 750.520j(1) &amp; (2),<sup>[2]</sup> Gagne filed a motion <i>in limine</i> seeking to introduce evidence regarding several aspects of Clark's prior sexual experiences and tastes. The trial judge denied the motion in part, excluding evidence regarding two subjects that are relevant here: an incident of group sexual activity involving Gagne, Clark, and a man named Ruben Bermudez; and Clark's solicitation of Gagne's father to join her and Gagne in group sex. The court's exclusion of this evidence gives rise to this appeal.</p>\n<p>The court also granted Gagne's motion in part, and, because it is especially relevant to our analysis, we recount in some detail the evidence the court decided to admit regarding sexual activity that occurred one night involving Gagne, Swathwood, Clark, and two other females they met at a bar called Tony's Lounge (\"the Tony's Lounge incident\"). In the spring of 2000, Clark, Swathwood, and Gagne went to Tony's Lounge, where they drank for some time. At the bar Swathwood met two women. All five of them departed together and went to a house belonging to one of the women. There were people at the house when they arrived. Clark and Gagne began to engage in some sort of \"sexual behavior\" in the living room while Swathwood had intercourse nearby with the other two women. Clark testified that she did not \"engage in sex of whatever kind with Donny Swathwood\" while they were in the living room. When someone knocked at the door, Clark and Gagne relocated to the bedroom where they began alternately having intercourse and arguing. Swathwood brought the other women into the bedroom. Gagne and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*282</span> Clark's argument escalated, and finally Clark left and went home.</p>\n<p>Clark was extremely intoxicated during these events; she testified that she drove home that night but did not remember doing so. The next day, Gagne informed her that there was more from the previous night that she did not remember, including that she had engaged in oral sex with Swathwood. Clark testified that she had no memory of this. Nonetheless, she believed Gagne and told others what had happened with Swathwood, including Swathwood's girlfriend at the time.</p>\n<p>Finally, Clark testified that, at some later date, she and Gagne \"were talking about being with other men or being with other women\" sexually, and discussed the Tony's Lounge incident:</p>\n<blockquote>And I told him that, you know, I honestly have not been with any other man except what you told me about [Swathwood] and I don't remember that. And he said to me, I was just lying `cause I wanted to go to bed with the samethe girl that [Swathwood] was having sex with. And Iand then he told me that he did have sex with her that night. And shethe girl had told me something different.</blockquote>\n<p>For his part, Swathwood testified that Clark engaged in oral sex with him that night in the presence of Gagne and the other two women. Swathwood answered \"yes\" when asked, \"Fair assessment to say this was kind of a group-sex, orgy-type situation?\"</p>\n<p>In her closing argument, the prosecutor repeatedly emphasized the unlikeliness of the defendants' version of the story, which, in her words, was \"more consistent with the pornographic movie than real life.\" The defense responded by attacking Clark's credibility and arguing that she had consented by pointing to the Tony's Lounge incident as evidence of this theory. During rebuttal, the prosecution argued to the jury, that, insofar as the Tony's Lounge incident was concerned, \"Even if you believe, contrary to . . . what Ms. Clark told you, that she did engage in consen[s]ual sexual contact with Mr. Swathwood, the nature of the contact and relations here were 190 degrees [sic] different. That situation did not involve, ladies and gentlemen, two men.\"</p>\n<p>On direct appeal, Gagne raised a number of claims, only one of which is relevant here: that the trial court violated his due process right to present a defense when it excluded the evidence regarding the group sexual activity with Bermudez, and Clark's solicitation of Gagne's father to participate in group sex with her and Gagne.</p>\n<p>The state appellate court acknowledged that rape shield statutes can occasionally abridge a defendant's constitutional rights, but concluded that the evidence of the group sexual activity with Bermudez and the invitation to Gagne's father were irrelevant because they involved third parties, not Swathwood. <i>People v. Swathwood,</i> Nos. 235540 and 235541, 2003 WL 1880143, at *1-2 (Mich.Ct.App. Apr.15, 2003). Additionally, the Bermudez incident was said to be even less relevant because it had occurred while Clark and Gagne were dating; by July 3, the couple had been separated for three weeks. <i>Id.</i> at *2. The court of appeals also determined that Gagne's constitutional rights were not violated because he was allowed to present evidence regarding the Tony's Lounge incident, which the court felt sufficiently demonstrated that Clark \"was not averse to group sexual activity.\" <i>Id.</i> at *3.</p>\n<p>The court of appeals affirmed Gagne and Swathwood's convictions and remanded for sentencing determinations that are irrelevant to this appeal. The state court proceedings ended when the Michigan Supreme <span class=\"star-pagination\">*283</span> Court denied Gagne leave to appeal.<sup>[3]</sup><i>People v. Gagne,</i> 469 Mich. 982, 673 N.W.2d 755 (2003) (unpublished table decision).</p>\n<p>Gagne filed a <i>pro se</i> petition for a writ of habeas corpus, asserting four claims. The district court granted relief on the due process claim arising from the trial court's exclusion of evidence. The court determined that relief was warranted because the excluded evidence was highly relevant since it involved occurrences remarkable in their similarity to the events on the night of July 3. This evidence was crucial to the defense because this case was essentially a \"credibility contest\" between Clark on the one hand, and Gagne and Swathwood on the other. The court granted Gagne a conditional writ of habeas corpus, and the State timely appealed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>We review a district court's decision to grant habeas relief <i>de novo. </i><i>Hereford v. Warren,</i> 536 F.3d 523, 527 (6th Cir.2008). Because Gagne filed his habeas petition after the enactment of the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\"AEDPA\"), Pub.L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214, we review the last reasoned state court decision on the issue to determine whether that decision \"was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\" or \"was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts.\" 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d). A state court's determination is contrary to clearly established federal law if \"the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by [the Supreme Court] on a question of law or if the state court decides a case differently than [the Supreme Court] has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.\" <i>Williams v. Taylor,</i> 529 U.S. 362, 412-13, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000). A state-court decision is an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law \"if the state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from [the Supreme Court's] decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner's case.\" <i>Id.</i> at 413, 120 S.Ct. 1495.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>The Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized that the right to present a complete defense in a criminal proceeding is one of the foundational principles of our adversarial truth-finding process: \"Whether rooted directly in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment or in the Compulsory Process or Confrontation Clauses of the Sixth Amendment, the Constitution guarantees criminal defendants `a meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense.'\" <i>Holmes v. South Carolina,</i> 547 U.S. 319, 324, 126 S.Ct. 1727, 164 L.Ed.2d 503 (2006) (quoting <i>Crane v. Kentucky,</i> 476 U.S. 683, 690, 106 S.Ct. 2142, 90 L.Ed.2d 636 (1986) (quoting <i>California v. Trombetta,</i> 467 U.S. 479, 485, 104 S.Ct. 2528, 81 L.Ed.2d 413 (1984)) (internal quotation marks omitted). But a \"meaningful opportunity\" is not \"every opportunity,\" and relevant evidence is frequently excluded from trial. Trial judges must make \"dozens, sometimes hundreds\" of evidentiary decisions throughout the course <span class=\"star-pagination\">*284</span> of a typical case, and rarely are these of constitutional significance: \"the Constitution leaves to the judges who must make these decisions `wide latitude' to exclude evidence that is `repetitive . . ., only marginally relevant' or poses an undue risk of `harassment, prejudice, [or] confusion of the issues.'\" <i>Crane,</i> 476 U.S. at 689-90, 106 S.Ct. 2142 (quoting <i>Delaware v. Van Arsdall,</i> 475 U.S. 673, 679, 106 S.Ct. 1431, 89 L.Ed.2d 674 (1986)) (alterations and omissions in original). But while the Constitution leaves much in the hands of the trial judge, \"an essential component of procedural fairness is an opportunity to be heard.\" <i>Id.</i> at 690, 106 S.Ct. 2142.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court in <i>Crane</i> made clear that whether a defendant has a constitutional right to present evidence turns on the extent to which that evidence is so \"highly relevant\" that it becomes \"indispensable\" to the success of the defense. 476 U.S. at 691, 106 S.Ct. 2142. In that case, the trial court excluded evidence of the circumstances surrounding the defendant's confession, which the defense argued would have cast doubt on the credibility of that confession. <i>Id.</i> at 684-86, 106 S.Ct. 2142. The Supreme Court, in determining that this exclusion violated the defendant's right to present a meaningful defense, explained that the \"opportunity [to be heard] would be an empty one if the State were permitted to exclude competent, reliable evidence bearing on the credibility of a confession when such evidence is central to the defendant's claim of innocence.\" <i>Id.</i> at 690, 106 S.Ct. 2142. The evidence, which related to the physical circumstances of the confession, was so \"highly relevant to [the] reliability and credibility\" of the confession, and the confession was so integral to the defense, that the excluded evidence was \"all but indispensable to any chance of [that defense] succeeding.\" <i>Id.</i> at 691, 106 S.Ct. 2142.</p>\n<p>In <i>Crane,</i> the Court's inquiry did not end with consideration of the defendant's interests. Rather, the Court sought to balance those interests against the state's interests in the evidentiary exclusion at issue; simplifying the Court's task was the fact that the state did not attempt to come forward with a justification for the questioned exclusion. <i>Crane,</i> 476 U.S. at 691, 106 S.Ct. 2142.</p>\n<p>Thus, <i>Crane</i> makes clear that a proper inquiry into the constitutionality of a court's decision to exclude evidence begins with considering the relevancy and cumulative nature of the excluded evidence, and the extent to which it was \"central\" or \"indispensable\" to the defense. Against this courts must balance the state's interests in enforcing the evidentiary rule on which the exclusion was based, in this case Michigan's rape shield statute.</p>\n<p>When applying this delicate balance to the Michigan rape shield statute, we do not write on a blank slate. The Supreme Court has already considered that statute and, in doing so, reiterated these competing considerations. <i>Michigan v. Lucas,</i> 500 U.S. 145, 111 S.Ct. 1743, 114 L.Ed.2d 205 (1991). In that case, the Court reviewed a holding of the Michigan Court of Appeals that the rape shield statute's \"notice-and-hearing requirement is unconstitutional in all cases where it is used to preclude evidence of past sexual conduct between a rape victim and a criminal defendant.\" <i>Id.</i> at 148, 111 S.Ct. 1743. Among other provisions, the statute requires the accused to file \"a written motion and offer of proof\" within ten days of his arraignment if he plans to introduce evidence of the victim's past sexual conduct. Mich. Comp. Laws § 750.20j(2). In <i>Lucas,</i> the defendant failed to file the motion in a timely manner and the trial court excluded the evidence on that basis. The Supreme Court recognized that \"the [rape shield] <span class=\"star-pagination\">*285</span> statute unquestionably implicates the Sixth Amendment\" but also noted that placing limits on the ability to present a defense \"does not necessarily render the statute unconstitutional.\" <i>Lucas,</i> 500 U.S. at 149, 111 S.Ct. 1743. Quoting the same passage from <i>Van Arsdall,</i> 475 U.S. at 679, 106 S.Ct. 1431, that it relied upon in <i>Crane, supra,</i> the Court recognized the wide latitude enjoyed by trial judges to limit the introduction of evidence. <i>Id.</i> In the Court's view, the Michigan rape shield law \"represents a valid legislative determination that rape victims deserve heightened protection against surprise, harassment, and unnecessary invasions of privacy.\" <i>Id.</i> at 150, 111 S.Ct. 1743. Given these competing considerations, the Court framed the question posed to it as follows: \"[W]hether the legitimate interests served by a notice requirement can ever justify precluding evidence of a prior sexual relationship between a rape victim and a criminal defendant.\" <i>Id.</i> at 151, 111 S.Ct. 1743.</p>\n<p>The Court answered in the affirmative and reversed the <i>per se</i> rule of the Michigan Court of Appeals. <i>Id.</i> at 152-53, 111 S.Ct. 1743. Significantly in our view, it did not hold that preclusion of evidence for failure to comply with a notice provision is <i>always</i> appropriate. As in all of its cases balancing evidentiary considerations with the right to present a complete defense, the Court made clear that a case by case evaluation is required. Accordingly, it remanded for the Michigan courts to perform such a balancing and, in doing so, the Court \"express[ed] no opinion as to whether or not preclusion was justified in this case.\" <i>Id.</i> at 153, 111 S.Ct. 1743.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV.</h2>\n<p>With these precepts in mind, we turn to the facts before us. The writ may issue only when petitioner is \"in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States.\" 28 U.S.C. § 2241(c)(3). And, as we stressed earlier in this opinion, our task is not to reach our own independent conclusion regarding the constitutional validity of the evidentiary decision to exclude evidence; rather, we must determine if the last reasoned state court opinion was either contrary to or involved an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States. 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1).<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>The Michigan Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court's judgment. It acknowledged that evidentiary laws, including rape shield statutes, must give way when constitutional rights of the accused, specifically the Sixth Amendment right to confrontation, are implicated. <i>People v. Swathwood,</i> 2003 WL 1880143, at *1 (citing <i>People v. Hackett,</i> 421 Mich. 338, 365 N.W.2d 120, 124 (1984) (\"in certain limited situations, such evidence [of prior sexual conduct] may not only be relevant, but its admission may be required to preserve a defendant's constitutional right to confrontation\")). Balanced against these constitutional considerations, the court of appeals observed that the Michigan Supreme Court has instructed trial courts to be \"mindful of the significant legislative purposes underlying the rape-shield statute and should always favor exclusion of evidence of a complainant's sexual conduct where its exclusion would not unconstitutionally abridge the defendant's right to confrontation.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>People v. Adair,</i> 452 Mich. 473, 550 N.W.2d 505, 511 (1996) (quoting <i>Hackett,</i> 365 N.W.2d at 125)) (quotation marks omitted). The balance struck by the court <span class=\"star-pagination\">*286</span> of appeals in this case is entirely consistent with the approach taken by the United States Supreme Court in <i>Lucas.</i> While the Michigan Court of Appeals did not cite federal constitutional law in its decision, its rendition of the appropriate legal analysis was not \"contrary to\" the \"clearly established\" federal law reflected in either <i>Crane</i> or <i>Lucas.</i></p>\n<p>That being the case, the writ may issue only if the court of appeals unreasonably applied that law. 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1). We conclude that it did. With respect to the evidence regarding a \"threesome\" that included petitioner, Clark, and Bermudez, it reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>[T]he complainant's willing participation in a threesome with Gagne and Bermudez is not probative of whether she consented to a threesome with Gagne and Swathwood on the night of the alleged offense. Notably, the threesome involving Bermudez occurred while the complainant and Gagne were still dating. The instant offense occurred after they had ended their relationship, and it involved Swathwood, not Bermudez. In light of the lack of similarity between the Bermudez threesome and the instant offense, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the evidence.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Swathwood,</i> at *2. The court of appeals also observed that the jury heard at length about the group sexual activity that followed the visit to Tony's Lounge, which included Clark and multiple partners. <i>Id.</i> at *3. Thus, \"defendants presented evidence that the complainant was not averse to group sexual activity\" and \"the trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the evidence.\" <i>Id.</i> at *2-3. The court employed similar reasoning before reaching the same conclusion with respect to the invitation to Gagne's father to join in group sex. <i>Id.</i> at *3.</p>\n<p>In our view, the court of appeals underestimated the vital nature of the disputed material, which we believe to be highly relevant, primarily as substantive evidence on the issue of whether Clark consented to the sexual activity the night of July 3, 2000.<sup>[5]</sup> The State argues otherwise in its brief to this court; inferring Clark's consent from these past incidents is</p>\n<blockquote>the very inference that rape-shield laws are meant to avoid; that somehow consent to unrelated sexual activity is relevant to whether the victim consented to the charged offense. Like evidence of a defendant's prior criminal acts, governed by MRE and FRE 404(b), propensity evidence carries a significant danger of unfair inference and prejudice.</blockquote>\n<p>The State is correct that evidentiary rules generally disfavor showing a person's propensity for certain actions by introducing evidence of past similar acts, and it is further correct that in rape cases evidence regarding \"unrelated sexual activity\" is generally accepted as only minimally relevant to the question of consent. But rape shield laws, including Michigan's, almost universally except from this rule evidence regarding prior sexual activity <i>between the complainant and the defendant,</i> precisely because that evidence carries heightened relevancy due to its increased similarity to the instance of the alleged rape. <i>See</i> Mich. Comp. Laws § 750.520j(1)(a); <i>see also</i> Fed.R.Evid. 412(b)(1)(B). In this case, these prior incidents have significant relevance not only because Gagne and Clark were involved in them, but also because they are both remarkably similar to the events that occurred the night of July 3.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*287</span> Nor do we agree with the State that the excluded evidence was cumulative to the testimony already introduced regarding the Tony's Lounge incident. There are, of course, similarities between this evidence and the excluded evidence: if Swathwood's version of the Tony's Lounge incident is believed, then it demonstrates that Clark had, on at least one occasion, engaged in sexual activities of some variety with multiple partners over the course of one night; it also shows that she did so with Gagne and Swathwood. But we find the differences, which the prosecution took pains to highlight in closing argument, to be more significant. First, the evidence that Clark engaged in group sex during the Tony's Lounge incident is at best equivocal because Clark testified that she did not remember engaging in any sexual activities with Swathwood that night. She further testified that Gagne later told her that he had made up that part of the story. And although Swathwood testified that this had, in fact, occurred, it would have been obvious to the jury that he had reason to lie about this incident in order to show that Clark had engaged in these similar activities in the past. The prosecution realized that the jury might not believe Swathwood and argued in closing that Clark had not engaged in oral sex with Swathwood during the Tony's Lounge incident.</p>\n<p>Second, even if the jury did believe that Clark and Swathwood had engaged in some sexual activity that night, there is no evidence at all that Clark engaged in that activity with multiple partners at once. At most the evidence shows only that, at some point during that night, she engaged in sexual intercourse with Gagne, and, at another point during the night, she engaged in oral sex with Swathwood, and did so in the presence of other people. This kind of activity differs substantially from the activity that occurred the night of July 3, in which three people engaged in simultaneous group sex. The prosecution, in discussing the Tony's Lounge incident, pointed out this difference to the jury in closing: \"Even if you believe, contrary to. . . what Ms. Clark told you, that she did engage in consen[s]ual sexual contact with Mr. Swathwood, the nature of the contact and relations here were 190 degrees [sic] different. That situation did not involve, ladies and gentlemen, two men.\"</p>\n<p>Finally, even if the excluded evidence merely points to the same predilections shown by the Tony's Lounge incident, the entire trial hinged upon consent, so the <i>weight</i> of the evidence on this question is extremely important. This is evident from the closing arguments, in which the prosecutor repeatedly stressed the unlikeliness of Gagne's story, and told the jury that his story was \"much more consistent with the pornographic movie than real life.\" The defense's theory was that Clark consented to the activities of July 3, but it had only the Tony's Lounge incident as evidence that she may have done so. In our view, the exclusion of the evidence of the group sexual activity with Bermudez and the invitation to Gagne's father were indispensable to the jury's ability to assess the likelihood of this theory.</p>\n<p>We cannot accurately portray the extent of Gagne's interest in presenting this evidence without reference to the lack of other evidence in this case. Other than the two defendants and the complainant, there were no eyewitnesses at all.<sup>[6]</sup> Nor did the physical evidence tend weigh in favor of one side or the other. In short, the excluded evidence was not just <i>relevant</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*288</span> to this case, it was in all likelihood the most relevant evidence regarding the sole contested issue at trialan issue about which there was not much evidence in the first place. We believe it was indispensable to the defense's theory, a conclusion amply demonstrated by the consistent focus during closing arguments on what little evidence the court did admit regarding the likelihood (or unlikelihood) that Clark would have consented to the activity the night of July 3, 2000.</p>\n<p>With this in mind, we turn to the Michigan Supreme Court for an indication of the State's interests in enforcing the rape shield statute. As the court of appeals recognized, the Michigan Supreme Court has explained that those interests are two-fold: to encourage victims to report criminal activity and testify at trial; and to further the truth-finding process by preventing the admission of minimally relevant evidence that creates a significant risk of prejudice or confusion. <i>See </i><i>Adair,</i> 550 N.W.2d at 509. We have acknowledged that there is always a real risk that allowing evidence concerning a complainant's sexual history will turn the case into a trial of the victim instead of the defendant. <i>Lewis v. Wilkinson,</i> 307 F.3d 413, 422 (6th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, we do not believe that admitting the evidence at issue in this case would overly frustrate the legitimate purposes of the rape shield statute. After all, the statute itself contains exceptions that demonstrate that the interests it usually serves must also accommodate the defendant's interest in the admission of evidence that is highly relevant, such as prior sexual conduct between the complainant and the defendant. While we are not reviewing the manner in which the Michigan courts applied the rape shield statute, which is a matter of state law, the fact that it contains this exception illustrates that the Michigan legislature recognized that the defendant has a heightened claim to the introduction of evidence of previous sexual contact with his accuser. This is not a case involving sex a decade before the subject incident. And what made the evidence even more central to petitioner's defense was the extraordinary nature of the events giving rise to the charge. The idea that someone could have consented to this sort of thing seems incredible absent proof that the person <i>had</i> consented to it before. Therein lies another similarity to <i>Crane.</i> In the underlying trial in <i>Crane</i> and in this case, the evidence that was admitted gave rise to a \"question every rational juror needs answered[.]\" 469 U.S. at 689, 105 S.Ct. 1005. In <i>Crane,</i> that question was, \"[i]f the defendant is innocent, why did he previously admit his guilt?\" <i>Id.</i> Here the question jurors would need to have answered if Gagne was to be acquitted was, \"how is it possible for anyone to consent to three-way sex of the kind described here?\" In each case the exclusion of evidence \"effectively disabled\" the defendant from answering the question. <i>Id.</i> Moreover, in this case, the excluded evidence would not have been unfairly prejudicial given the sexually graphic testimony that had already been admitted as well as the testimony involving the use of crack cocaine and other narcotics. And as we pointed out in <i>Lewis,</i> \"the court could minimize any danger of undue prejudice by admitting the evidence with a cautionary instruction and strictly limiting the scope of cross-examination.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Finally, we stress that our holding is fact-bound in the extreme: under the circumstances present here, the exclusion of evidence of the complainant's consensual three-way sex with the defendant only a month before the subject incident, in a three-way rape case in which extensive evidence of the victim's sexual conduct had already been admitted at trial, and where <span class=\"star-pagination\">*289</span> the question of guilt or innocence turned almost entirely on the credibility of the victim's testimony regarding consent, was an unreasonable application of the principles set forth by the Supreme Court in <i>Crane.</i> That case made clear that a defendant's constitutional right to present a defense, arising from the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, entails the right to put before the jury evidence which is highly relevant, non-cumulative, and indispensable to the central dispute in a criminal trial. This conclusion is also consistent with <i>Lucas,</i> a case in which the Court recognized that the Michigan rape shield statute implicates the Sixth Amendment rights of the accused and therefore its application must be carefully balanced against the legitimate interests served by the statute on a case by case basis. <i>Lucas,</i> 500 U.S. at 149, 111 S.Ct. 1743. Reliance upon those legitimate interests in this case to exclude the incidents at issue runs contrary to the statute's exception that would allow a defendantin this case petitioner to present evidence of the victim's past sexual conduct with the actor. Mich. Comp. Laws § 750.520j. While the trial judge may exclude such evidence if its inflammatory or prejudicial nature outweighs its probative value, that discretion cannot trump the constitutional right of the accused to present evidence that is so \"highly relevant\" that its introduction, as in this case, is \"indispensable\" to the defense. <i>Crane,</i> 476 U.S. at 691, 106 S.Ct. 2142. For these reasons, we hold that the Michigan Court of Appeals opinion constitutes an \"unreasonable application of[] clearly established Federal law,\" 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1), that deprived petitioner of his constitutional right to \"a meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense\" as articulated by the Supreme Court in <i>Crane.</i> The writ shall issue.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>V.</h2>\n<p>The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p>KETHLEDGE, Circuit Judge, concurring.</p>\n<p>It is hard for a court to invalidate a provision that does not even apply to the case at hand. It is harder still to invalidate a whole gaggle of provisions that actually support the result reached in the case. Yet that, according to the rhetoric in support of the State's petition for rehearing, is the feat we have managed here. I think the rhetoric is seriously overblown.</p>\n<p>We are told, in support of rehearing, that our decision effectively invalidates every rape-shield law in this circuit. That argument cannot be squared with the text of those laws. The core of any rape-shield law is its proscription against evidence of past sexual activity by the victim. But every one of those lawsor at least every one we are said to have vaporized here contains an exception for evidence of the victim's prior sexual activity <i>with the defendant.</i> And that is exactly the kind of evidence that we hold should have been admitted in this case. Michigan's statute excepts from its proscription \"[e]vidence of the victim's past sexual conduct with the actor.\" Mich. Comp. Laws § 750.520j(1)(a). Ohio's statute does the same. <i>See</i> Ohio Rev.Code § 2907.02(D) (excepting evidence of \"the victim's past sexual activity with the offender\"). So does the Tennessee rule. <i>See</i> Tenn. R. Evid. 412(c)(3) (allowing admission of evidence of \"sexual behavior . . . with the accused, on the issue of consent\"). The federal rule affirmatively provides that \"evidence of specific instances of sexual behavior\" between the alleged victim and defendant \"<i>is</i> admissible,\" if offered to prove consent and otherwise admissible under the rules. Fed.R.Evid. 412(b)(1)(B) <span class=\"star-pagination\">*290</span> (emphasis added). Kentucky's rule is identical to the federal one. <i>See</i> Ky. R. Evid. 412(b)(1)(B). I am of course mindful that we apply only constitutional rules, not statutory ones, on habeas review. But rhetorically speaking, our decision applies these laws, rather than abrogates them.</p>\n<p>Equally misdirected is the claim that we have trampled upon the policies that animate these laws. As Judge Norris's opinion carefully explains, we hold that, under the rather extraordinary facts presented here, certain evidence of the complainant's prior consensual sex with the defendant was indispensable to his ability to present a complete defense at trial. The argument now is that, in deeming that evidence indispensable, we have indulged in outdated inferences whose eradication was a principal aim of these laws. But the argument again is let down by the laws. Every one of these laws is supported by significant state interests. (The extent to which those interests are implicated in a particular case, as discussed below, is another matter.) And yet, notwithstanding those important interests, every one of these laws contains an exception for evidence of consensual sex with the defendant. These laws must infer something very important about such evidence; and they do so especially in caseslike this onewhere consent itself is the issue. The inference is that, in some (and perhaps most) cases, evidence of past consensual sex with the defendant is highly relevant to the issue of consent in the incident giving rise to the charge. We merely conclude that this is such a case.</p>\n<p>Notable as well is that the caselaw in Michigan, and the terms of the federal and Tennessee rules, expressly wave off the rape-shield proscription as to \"evidence the exclusion of which would violate the constitutional rights of the defendant.\" Fed.R.Evid. 412(b)(1)(C); <i>see also </i><i>People v. Hackett,</i> 421 Mich. 338, 365 N.W.2d 120, 124 (1984) (recognizing that, in some situations, admission of evidence relating to the victim's sexual conduct \"may be required to preserve a defendant's constitutional right to confrontation\"); <i>People v. Adair,</i> 452 Mich. 473, 550 N.W.2d 505, 511 (1996) (rejecting a construction of Michigan's rape-shield statute that would have \"run[] the risk of violating a defendant's Sixth Amendment constitutional right to confrontation\"); Tenn. R. Evid. 412(c)(1). We do not, of course, look to these rules in determining whether there was a violation of clearly established federal constitutional law. But these provisions do show that the rules' drafters knew very well that they were operating close to the constitutional line. That the rules' application might cross it, on occasion, should surprise no one.</p>\n<p>I also think the rehearing petition overstates the breadth of our holding in this case. We do not hold that the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Crane v. Kentucky,</i> 476 U.S. 683, 106 S.Ct. 2142, 90 L.Ed.2d 636 (1986), clearly establishes a rape defendant's constitutional right to admit evidence of the victim's prior consensual activity with the defendant (much less with persons other than the defendant). What we do say, as a starting point for the analysis, is that <i>Crane</i> clearly establishes that \"the Constitution guarantees criminal defendants `a meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 690, 106 S.Ct. 2142 (quoting <i>California v. Trombetta,</i> 467 U.S. 479, 485, 104 S.Ct. 2528, 81 L.Ed.2d 413 (1984)). The State of Ohio, as amicus, says this rule is stated at too high a level of generality to support habeas relief here. That point is a serious one; the more general a rule, the more difficult it is to say that the state court unreasonably applied the rule to a particular set of facts. With generality often comes discretion. But I think the facts of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*291</span> <i>Crane</i> and those of this case converge at a level closer to the ground than the State realizes.</p>\n<p><i>Crane</i> requires consideration of two factors in determining whether the exclusion of evidence denies the defendant a meaningful right to present a complete defense. The first is the extent to which the evidence was \"central to the defendant's claim of innocence.\" <i>Id.</i> The second is the extent to which its exclusion was supported by a \"valid state justification[.]\" <i>Id.</i> In <i>Crane,</i> the defendant was convicted of murder. He was 16 years old at the time of the crime. There was \"no physical evidence to link him\" to the murder. <i>Id.</i> at 691, 106 S.Ct. 2142. The State's evidence of guilt was primarily Crane's own confession. Crane sought to discredit the confession with testimony that \"he had been detained in a windowless room for a protracted period of time, that he had been surrounded by as many as six police officers during the interrogation, that he had repeatedly requested and been denied permission to telephone his mother, and that he had been badgered into making a false confession.\" <i>Id.</i> at 685, 106 S.Ct. 2142. That evidence, the Supreme Court said, was \"highly relevant\" to the reliability and credibility of the confession, which again was the State's primary evidence of guilt. <i>Id.</i> at 691, 106 S.Ct. 2142. And the Court saw no justification for excluding the evidence under the circumstances presented there. The Court did not \"pass on the strength or merits\" of Crane's defense. <i>Id.</i> But it held, unanimously, that the exclusion of Crane's testimony violated his right to present a complete defense.</p>\n<p>The analysis flows in the same channels here. First, the excluded evidence was \"central to the defendant's claim of innocence.\" <i>Id.</i> at 690, 106 S.Ct. 2142. Gagne was convicted of forcing Clark to engage in an outlandish sexual encounter with himself and another man. The events making up that encounter were largely undisputed; what was disputed was whether Clark consented. There was little if any physical evidence of non-consent. The State's primary evidence of guilt, rather, was Clark's own testimony that she did not consent. Gagne sought to discredit that testimony with evidence thatonly one month before the subject incidentClark had voluntarily engaged in three-way sex with Gagne and another man, and that she had suggested the same thing on another occasion. That evidence would have included testimony not only from Gagne, but also from Ruben Bermudez, the other participant in the three-way the month before, who according to Gagne's lawyer was prepared to testify at trial. <i>See</i> 1/2/01 Hearing Tr. 18-19. But the trial court excluded all of that testimony. That exclusion was affirmed by the state court of appeals, which held remarkablythat the excluded testimony was not even relevant to the case.</p>\n<p>That the excluded evidence was highly relevant can be inferred, as discussed above, from the rape-shield statutes themselves. Moreover, as Judge Norris explains, in both this case and <i>Crane</i> the excluded evidence, if credited, answers a question that, if left unanswered, leads directly to conviction. <i>See</i> Maj. Op. at ___-___.</p>\n<p>The State says the trial court's admission of evidence of another sexual encounterthe so-called Tony's Lounge incident, which involved five peoplemade the three-way evidence only marginal, rather than central, to Gagne's defense. But the prosecution itself did a credible job of explaining, in closing argument, why the Tony's Lounge evidence did very little to answer the question described above. I think that Judge Norris's opinion convincingly finishes the job.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*292</span> What <i>is</i> significant is the effect of the Tony's Lounge evidence upon the State's interest in excluding the Gagne and Bermudez three-way testimony. This, in my view, is where the bottom falls out of the State's argument on appeal. As an initial matter, this case only weakly implicates the interests protected by Michigan's rape-shield statute, since the statute's terms did not even bar the excluded testimony, but instead left its admission to the discretion of the Ingham County Circuit Judge. <i>See</i> Mich. Comp. Laws § 750.520j (1)(a). And it is hard to see what was left of those interests, such as they were in this case, given the evidence that <i>was</i> admitted at trial. That evidence included that, during the Tony's Lounge incident, Clark had engaged in oral sex with Swathwood shortly after intercourse with Gagne, and that she had engaged in consensual oral sex with Gagne minutes before the very incident for which he was convicted (and moreover that she had drunk a pint of vodka and nine or so beers and smoked crack in the hours before the incident). I entirely agree that Michigan's rape-shield law protects important state interests in the vast majority of cases in which it is implicated. But I submit that, under the circumstances of this trial, there was virtually nothing left of those interests to protect.</p>\n<p>So here, as in <i>Crane,</i> the prosecution's case hinged on a single account of what happened during the underlying incident. In each case, the nature of that accounta confession there, and the outlandish conduct alleged to have been coerced here tended to make the account especially persuasive to a jury. In each case, the trial court excluded highly relevant evidence that, if credited, could have undermined the account upon which the State relied. And in each case the State's interest in excluding that evidence was negligible.</p>\n<p>These parallels emerge, admittedly, only after close analysis. But I think they are clear enough to render the state court's decision unreasonable within the meaning of the habeas statute. (It bears mention that two Justices of the Michigan Supreme Court voted to reverse the decision summarily, and that Justice Markman voted to hear the case. <i>See</i> 469 Mich. 982, 673 N.W.2d 755 (Mich.2003) (unpublished table disposition).) The exclusion of the three-way evidence clearly violated Gagne's Sixth Amendment and procedural due process rights. He should have been able to present that evidence to a jury before ultimately being sentenced to a prison term of up to 45 years.</p>\n<p>My purpose in reciting this evidence, however, is not to explain what Judge Norris has already explained in his nuanced opinion. And I readily admit that reasonable people, including the respected Chief Judge of our court, can disagree with my conclusion in this case. Nor do I mean to \"pass on the strength or merits\" of Gagne's defense. <i>Crane,</i> 476 U.S. at 691, 106 S.Ct. 2142. I think those merits should have been left to the jury; and otherwise I do not hold a torch for anyone involved in the underlying events of this case.</p>\n<p>My purpose, instead, is to emphasize the limited nature of our holding in this case. <i>See also</i> Maj. Op. at ___-___. With respect, I do not think that holding has nearly the jurisprudential consequences that Michigan and the amici States seem to think it has.</p>\n<p>For these reasons, I continue to concur fully in Judge Norris's opinion.</p>\n<p>ALICE M. BATCHELDER, Chief Judge, dissenting.</p>\n<p>Some 35 years ago, the Michigan state legislature determined that a criminal defendant accused of rape may not introduce <span class=\"star-pagination\">*293</span> evidence about the victim's past sexual behavior, because the victim's past willingness is not relevant to the question of present consent. The majority here disagrees with that legislative determination and concludes that evidence of the victim's promiscuity or previous willingness to engage in somewhat similar sex acts was not only relevant but was \"indispensable\" and \"the most relevant evidence.\" Moreover, because this appeal arises in the context of a habeas proceeding, the majority ultimately holds that the rape defendant has a \"constitutionally protected\" and \"clearly established\" right to introduce this evidence. In so holding, the majority effectively abrogates every rape-shield statute in this circuit.<sup>[1]</sup> I do not believe that there is any such constitutional right to present evidence of a rape victim's promiscuity or past willingness to engage in sex acts, nor do I believe that the majority is justified in its condemnation of the rape-shield concept. I dissent.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A.</h2>\n<p>In concluding its analysis, and justifying its grant of habeas relief, the majority cites <i>Crane v. Kentucky,</i> 476 U.S. 683, 106 S.Ct. 2142, 90 L.Ed.2d 636 (1986), as the \"clearly established law\" that the Michigan Court of Appeals \"unreasonably applied.\" <i>See</i> Maj. Op. at ___ (\"We therefore conclude that the state appellate court's determination on this issue was an unreasonable application of the principles set forth by the Supreme Court in <i>Crane.</i>\"). The majority offers the following exposition of those \"principles\":</p>\n<blockquote>\n<i>Crane makes clear</i> that a proper inquiry into the <i>constitutionality</i> of a court's decision to exclude evidence begins with considering the relevancy and cumulative nature of the excluded evidence, and the extent to which it was `central' or `indispensable' to the defense. Against this courts must balance the state's interests in enforcing the evidentiary rule on which the exclusion was based, in this case Michigan's rape shield statute.</blockquote>\n<p>Maj. Op. at ___ (underlining added) (citing <i>Crane,</i> 476 U.S. at 691, 106 S.Ct. 2142). So, according to the majority, <i>Crane</i> stands for the clear proposition that if a defendant accused of rape can show that evidence of the rape victim's promiscuity or prior willingness to perform sex acts is \"highly relevant, non-cumulative, and indispensable to the central dispute in a criminal trial,\" then that defendant has a <i>constitutional right</i> to \"put [that evidence] before the jury.\" Maj. Op. at ___.</p>\n<p>I cannot accept this proposition. Foremost, I do not agree with its constitutional premise. That is, in light of <i>Michigan v. Lucas,</i> 500 U.S. 145, 111 S.Ct. 1743, 114 L.Ed.2d 205 (1991), I do not believe that there is any such constitutional right. But, even if I am mistaken in my reading of <i>Lucas,</i> I cannot agree that this proposition wasor, indeed, is now\"clearly established\" as Supreme Court precedent, and I do not agree that such a liberal extension of <i>Crane</i> is justified (or justifiable). Moreover, I cannot agree that the Michigan Court of Appeals's application of these governing principles (such as they are) was \"objectively unreasonable.\" Finally, I am simply unwilling to sanction the inevitable, albeit unacknowledged, consequence of this decisionthat rape-shield statutes are <i>ipso facto</i> unconstitutional, inasmuch as their very purpose is to exclude, on policy grounds, evidence that is almost <span class=\"star-pagination\">*294</span> always \"highly relevant, non-cumulative, and indispensable to the central dispute in a criminal trial.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1.</h2>\n<p>In <i>Lucas,</i> 500 U.S. at 147, 111 S.Ct. 1743, the Michigan prosecutor charged Nolan Lucas with criminal sexual conduct based on his ex-girlfriend's accusation that he forced her to his apartment at knife point and forced her to perform various sex acts against her will. <i>Id.</i> at 147, 111 S.Ct. 1743. Lucas and the ex-girlfriend had ended a six-to-seven month relationship just two weeks earlier and Lucas insisted that the entire episode was consensual, that he had not used a knife or any other force. <i>See </i><i>Michigan v. Lucas,</i> 160 Mich.App. 692, 408 N.W.2d 431, 431-32 (1987). At trial, the ex-girlfriend claimed rape and Lucas claimed consent. <i>See Michigan v. Lucas,</i> 469 N.W.2d 435, 436 (Mich.App.1991) (\"Virtually all of the evidence in this case consisted of complainant's word against the word of defendant.\").</p>\n<p>At trial, Lucas's counsel sought to introduce testimony regarding the couple's relationship specifically, their sexual history as evidence of consent, but the state objected on the basis that defense counsel had not given prior notice of its intent to use that evidence, as was required by the Michigan rape-shield statute, M.C.L. § 750.520j. <i>See </i><i>Lucas,</i> 500 U.S. at 147, 111 S.Ct. 1743. The trial court agreed that Lucas's counsel had failed to comply with the notice provision of the rape-shield statute and refused to admit the evidence. <i>Id.</i> at 148, 111 S.Ct. 1743.</p>\n<p>After being convicted and sentenced, Lucas appealed. <i>Id.</i> The Michigan Court of Appeals vacated the conviction, holding \"that the [Michigan rape-shield statute]'s notice-and-hearing requirement is unconstitutional in all cases where it is used to preclude evidence of past sexual conduct between a rape victim and a criminal defendant.\" <i>Id.</i> The United State Supreme Court granted certiorari to decide this constitutional question and ultimately concluded:</p>\n<blockquote>[T]he Michigan Court of Appeals erred in adopting a <i>per se</i> rule that Michigan's notice-and-hearing requirement violates the Sixth Amendment in all cases where it is used to preclude evidence of past sexual conduct between a rape victim and a defendant. The Sixth Amendment is not so rigid. The notice-and-hearing requirement serves legitimate state interests in protecting against surprise, harassment, and undue delay. Failure to comply with this requirement may in some cases justify even the severe sanction of preclusion.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 152-53, 111 S.Ct. 1743. The Supreme Court vacated the judgment and remanded the case, stating:</p>\n<blockquote>We leave it to the Michigan courts to address in the first instance whether Michigan's rape-shield statute authorizes preclusion and whether, on the facts of this case, preclusion violated Lucas' rights under the Sixth Amendment.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 153, 111 S.Ct. 1743. So, the Supreme Court expressly did not decide the preclusion question, which is the question before us here. And, the inescapable consequence of this <i>non</i>-decisionthe avoidance of this particular questionis that the Court has not articulated any \"clearly established\" law on this issue.</p>\n<p>In the present case, however, the Michigan courts did consider whether Michigan's rape-shield statute authorizes preclusion and determined, on the facts of <i>this</i> case, that preclusion of certain testimony concerning Ms. Clark's alleged prior sexual activities did not violate defendant Gagne's rights under the Sixth Amendment. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*295</span> Because the <i>Lucas</i> Court had left this issue unresolved, <i>Lucas</i> offers little direct guidance on this issue (i.e., <i>Lucas</i> did not \"clearly establish\" any law on this particular issue), but it certainly offers some guidance, the most telling of which comes from what it did <i>not</i> hold.</p>\n<p>The <i>Lucas</i> Court did not hold what the majority holds todaythat a defendant has a constitutional right to put evidence before the jury because the evidence was highly relevant, non-cumulative, and indispensable to the central dispute. If the evidence at issue in the present case was highly relevant, non-cumulative, and indispensable to the central dispute, then the evidence in <i>Lucas</i> was equally or more so. In the present case, the evidence concerned the victim's alleged willingness to participate in a particular sexual practice on at least two prior occasions; in <i>Lucas,</i> the evidence concerned the victim's six-to-seven month relationship with the defendant, the emotional, physical, and sexual nature of their relationship, and the patterns and practices incident thereto. If the former is \"highly relevant,\" then so must be the latter. In the present case, the court excluded two incidents of prior sexual activities, but admitted testimony about three others; in <i>Lucas,</i> the court excluded any reference whatsoever to the prior sexual relationship. If the former is \"non-cumulative,\" so must be the latter. And, finally, the central issue in the present case was the defendant's asserted defense of consent, which was also the central issue in <i>Lucas.</i> If evidence concerning consent in the former is \"indispensable to the central dispute,\" so it must be in the latter.</p>\n<p>So, it bears emphasizing that even though the evidence in <i>Lucas</i> was clearly \"highly relevant, non-cumulative, and indispensable to the central dispute in a criminal trial,\" <i>see</i> Maj. Op. at ___, the <i>Lucas</i> Court <i>did not hold</i>and did not even suggestthat the defendant therefore had some over-arching <i>constitutional right</i> to \"put [that evidence] before the jury,\" <i>see</i> Maj. Op. at ___. In fact, the <i>Lucas</i> Court implicitly rejected any such right, holding instead that the defendant's \"[f]ailure to comply with [the notice] requirement may in some cases justify even the severe sanction of preclu[ding]\" such highly relevant, non-cumulative, and indispensable evidence. <i>See </i><i>Lucas,</i> 500 U.S. at 153, 111 S.Ct. 1743. It is perhaps just as important that the <i>Lucas</i> Court expressly left it to the Michigan courts to decide \"whether, on the facts of this case, preclusion [of the propensity evidence] violated Lucas' rights under the Sixth Amendment.\" <i>See id.</i> The majority notes that \"rape shield laws, including Michigan's, almost universally except from this rule evidence regarding prior sexual activity <i>between the complainant and the defendant,</i> precisely because that evidence carries heightened relevancy due to its increased similarity to the instance of the alleged rape.\" Maj. Op. at ___ (emphasis in original). But in <i>Lucas,</i> it was exactly that type of sexual-history evidence that had been precluded.</p>\n<p>So, the clear implication of <i>Lucas</i> is that the trial court can, without running afoul of the Constitution, exclude highly relevant, non-cumulative, and indispensable evidence from a criminal defendant's trial. That is, <i>Lucas</i> clearly demonstrates that a court <i>can</i> constitutionally exclude such evidence on the basis that the defendant's attorney failed to comply with the statute's notice requirement. Therefore, the right (such as it is) to put that evidence before the jury is not grounded in the Constitution, but is instead grounded in state law or the state's proper application of that law. <i>Cf. </i><i>Dist. Atty.'s Office for the Third Judicial Dist. v. Osborne,</i> 557 U.S. ___, 129 S.Ct. 2308, 2320, 174 L.Ed.2d 38 (2009) <span class=\"star-pagination\">*296</span> (holding that there is no stand-alone constitutional right to access evidence for purposes of DNA testing, there is at most a constitutional right to the proper application of a state-created right).</p>\n<p>The majority's proposition cannot survive <i>Lucas.</i> While the Supreme Court has left its Sixth Amendment analysis unarticulated post-<i>Lucas,</i> it is evident from the foregoing that whatever the proper analysis may be, the majority's (unprecedented) proposition does not conform to it.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2.</h2>\n<p>The majority's holding is premised on <i>Crane v. Kentucky,</i> 476 U.S. 683, 684, 106 S.Ct. 2142, 90 L.Ed.2d 636 (1986), a case in which a 16-year-old defendant was implicated in the murder of a liquor store clerk and signed a confession at the police station. At the boy's trial, the court refused to admit evidence about the circumstances surrounding his confession\"that he had been detained in a windowless room for a protracted period of time . . . surrounded by as many as six police officers . . ., that he had repeatedly requested and been denied permission to telephone his mother, and that he had been badgered into making a false confession.\" <i>Id.</i> at 685, 106 S.Ct. 2142. The jury convicted him of the murder and the court sentenced him to 40 years in prison. <i>Id.</i> On appeal to the Supreme Court, the Court reversed the conviction on constitutional grounds. <i>Id.</i> at 687, 106 S.Ct. 2142.</p>\n<p>The Court explained that, while a pre-trial confession is \"not conclusive of guilt,\" it certainly changes the complexion of the defense and invariably raises \"the one question every rational juror needs answered: If the defendant is innocent, why did he previously admit his guilt?\" <i>Id.</i> at 689, 106 S.Ct. 2142. Thus, the Court explained, such \"a defendant's case may stand or fall on his ability to convince the jury that the manner in which the confession was obtained casts doubt on its credibility.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<blockquote>This simple insight is reflected in a federal statute, 18 U.S.C. § 3501(a), the Federal Rules of Evidence, Fed. Rule Evid. 104(e), and the statutory and decisional law of virtually every State in the Nation [citations omitted]. We recognize, of course, that under our federal system even a consensus as broad as this one is not inevitably congruent with the dictates of the Constitution. We acknowledge also our traditional reluctance to impose constitutional constraints on ordinary evidentiary rulings by state trial courts. In any given criminal case the trial judge is called upon to make dozens, sometimes hundreds, of decisions concerning the admissibility of evidence. As we reaffirmed earlier this Term, the Constitution leaves to the judges who must make these decisions wide latitude to exclude evidence that is repetitive, only marginally relevant[,] or poses an undue risk of harassment, prejudice, or confusion of the issues. Moreover, we have never questioned the power of States to exclude evidence through the application of evidentiary rules that themselves serve the interests of fairness and reliabilityeven if the defendant would prefer to see that evidence admitted. Nonetheless, without signaling any diminution in the respect traditionally accorded to the States in the establishment and implementation of their own criminal trial rules and procedures, we have little trouble concluding <i>on the facts of this case that the blanket exclusion of the proffered testimony about the circumstances of petitioner's confession deprived him of a fair trial.</i>\n</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 689-90, 106 S.Ct. 2142 (citations, quotation and editorial marks omitted; emphasis added).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*297</span> Thus, the clear proposition for which <i>Crane</i> stands is that when a criminal defendant, having signed a confession, nonetheless proceeds to trial, the Constitution guarantees that defendant the right to present evidence (i.e., the right to be heard) about the circumstances surrounding the confession, so that he may present a complete defense by challenging the credibility of that pre-trial confession. A broader application is not evident (or inevitable) from the text of the <i>Crane</i> opinion.</p>\n<p>In <i>Holmes v. South Carolina,</i> 547 U.S. 319, 126 S.Ct. 1727, 164 L.Ed.2d 503 (2006)a case the majority cites in support of <i>Crane</i>the Supreme Court characterized <i>Crane</i> as a case about an \"arbitrary\" rule:</p>\n<blockquote>Another arbitrary rule was held unconstitutional in <i>Crane v. Kentucky,</i> [476 U.S. 683, 106 S.Ct. 2142, 90 L.Ed.2d 636 (1986)]. There, the defendant was prevented from attempting to show at trial that his confession was unreliable because of the circumstances under which it was obtained, and neither the [Kentucky] State Supreme Court nor the prosecution `advanced any rational justification for the wholesale exclusion of this body of potentially exculpatory evidence.' <i>Id.</i> at 691 [106 S.Ct. 2142].</blockquote>\n<p><i>Holmes,</i> 547 U.S. at 326, 126 S.Ct. 1727. It is noteworthy that, although it cited Holmes, the majority here did not hold that the Michigan rape-shield statute is \"arbitrary\" or that the Michigan Court of Appeals failed to \"advance[] any rational justification\" for its exclusion of the sexual propensity evidence.</p>\n<p>The majority cites <i>Crane</i> as the \"clearly established law\" that the Michigan Court of Appeals \"unreasonably applied\" in this case. <i>See</i> Maj. Op. at ___ (\"We therefore conclude that the state appellate court's determination on this issue was an unreasonable application of the principles set forth by the Supreme Court in <i>Crane.</i>\"). That is, the majority views <i>Crane</i>a decision that upheld a criminal defendant's constitutional right to introduce evidence about the circumstances surrounding <i>his own</i> (allegedly coerced) pre-trial confession as the \"clearly established\" or governing law on the constitutionality of a criminal defendant's right to introduce evidence about the <i>victim</i>'s prior willingness to participate in certain private, potentially humiliating, sex acts, based on the defendant's theory that her previous willingness would be indicative of her current willingness.</p>\n<p>I do not agree that the majority's rendition of <i>Crane</i> is or was \"clearly established.\" In my view, the majority has extended <i>Crane</i> well beyond any reading or application justified by the language of the opinion or any subsequent case. It is unfair to fault the Michigan Court of Appeals, as the majority does, for failing to anticipate this novel extension of <i>Crane.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3.</h2>\n<p>The majority's approach does not comply with the limitations of AEDPA. Under AEDPA, the phrase \"unreasonable application of\" Supreme Court precedent means that the state court \"identifie[d] the correct governing legal principle from [Supreme Court] decisions but unreasonably applie[d] that principle to the facts\" of the case. <i>Williams v. Taylor,</i> 529 U.S. 362, 413, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000). But, \"a federal habeas court may not issue the writ simply because [it] concludes in its independent judgment that the relevant state-court decision applied clearly established federal law erroneously or incorrectly.\" <i>Lockyer v. Andrade,</i> 538 U.S. 63, 75-76, 123 S.Ct. 1166, 155 L.Ed.2d 144 (2003) (quoting <i>Williams,</i> 529 U.S. at 411, 120 S.Ct. 1495). Even \"a <i>firm conviction</i> that the state court was erroneous\" is <span class=\"star-pagination\">*298</span> not enough. <i>Id.</i> at 75, 123 S.Ct. 1166 (quotation marks omitted; emphasis added). Rather, \"[t]he state court's application of clearly established law must be <i>objectively unreasonable.</i>\" <i>Id.</i> at 76, 123 S.Ct. 1166 (emphasis added); <i>see also </i><i>Wright v. Van Patten,</i> 552 U.S. 120, 128 S.Ct. 743, 747, 169 L.Ed.2d 583 (2008) (\"Because our cases give no clear answer to the question presented, let alone one in [petitioner]'s favor, it cannot be said that the state court unreasonably applied clearly established Federal law.\" (quotation marks and citations omitted)).</p>\n<p>A review of the Michigan Court of Appeals' decision reveals that its application, far from being \"objectively unreasonable,\" was eminently reasonable. The court explained its approach:</p>\n<blockquote>Evidence of specific instances of a victim's past sexual conduct with others is generally legally irrelevant and inadmissible under the rape-shield statute, M.C.L. § 750.520j. In certain limited situations, evidence that does not come within the specific exceptions of the statute may be relevant and its admission required to preserve a criminal defendant's Sixth Amendment right of confrontation.. . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Inquiries into sex histories, even when minimally relevant, carry a danger of unfairly prejudicing and misleading the jury. Application of the rape-shield statute must be done on a case-by-case basis, and the balance between the rights of the victim and the defendant must be weighed anew in each case. In exercising its discretion, the trial court should be mindful of the significant legislative purposes underlying the rape-shield statute and should always favor exclusion of evidence of a complainant's sexual conduct where its exclusion would not unconstitutionally abridge the defendant's right to confrontation.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Michigan v. Swathwood,</i> No. 235540 &amp; 235541, 2003 WL 1880143, *1 (Mich.App. Apr.15, 2003) (citations and quotations marks omitted). The court considered the evidence and, concluding that evidence of Ms. Clark's propensity to participate in certain sex acts was not probative of whether she consented to the acts complained of in the present case, affirmed the trial court. <i>Id.</i> at *2-4.</p>\n<p>I cannot agree that the Michigan Court of Appeals's application of the governing principles was \"objectively unreasonable.\" It appears to me that the majority does not dispute the state court's application of the law so much as it simply disagrees with either the Michigan legislature's policy determination about the relevance of this propensity evidence or with the state court's measure of the probity or relevance of this evidence. Neither is a proper basis for habeas relief.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>4.</h2>\n<p>It is commonly understood that the uncorroborated testimony of a rape victim is sufficient to support a conviction. <i>See </i><i>Tibbs v. Florida,</i> 457 U.S. 31, 45 n. 21, 102 S.Ct. 2211, 72 L.Ed.2d 652 (1982); <i>Brown v. Davis,</i> 752 F.2d 1142, 1144 (6th Cir. 1985) (holding that the testimony of a single, uncorroborated rape victim is sufficient to support conviction); <i>Michigan v. Whittaker,</i> 2007 WL 914342, *5 (Mich.App. Mar.27, 2007) (\"Indeed, in cases of sexual assault, a conviction may `be based upon the uncorroborated testimony of the woman assaulted.'\") (quoting <i>Michigan v. Miller,</i> 96 Mich. 119, 55 N.W. 675, 676 (1893)); M.C.L. § 750.520h (\"The testimony of a victim need not be corroborated in [rape and sexual assault] prosecutions under sections 520b to 520g.\"). But, the majority is not so easily persuaded.</p>\n<blockquote>The defense's theory was that Clark consented to the activities of July 3, but <span class=\"star-pagination\">*299</span> it had only the Tony's Lounge incident as evidence that she may have done so. In our view, the exclusion of the evidence of the group sexual activity with Bermudez and the invitation to Gagne's father were indispensable to the jury's ability to assess the likelihood of this theory. We cannot accurately portray the extent of Gagne's interest in presenting this evidence without reference to the lack of other evidence in this case. Other than the two defendants and the complainant, there were no eyewitnesses at all. Nor did the physical evidence tend weigh in favor of one side or the other. In short, the excluded evidence was not just <i>relevant</i> to this case, it was in all likelihood the most relevant evidence regarding the sole contested issue at trialan issue about which there was not much evidence in the first place. We believe it was indispensable to the defense's theory. . . .</blockquote>\n<p>Maj. Op. at ___-___ (paragraph break and footnote omitted).</p>\n<p>First, let's be very clear about what the majority means when it says \"evidence of the group sexual activity with Bermudez and the invitation to Gagne's father.\" This \"evidence\" is simply Gagne's uncorroborated testimony about these alleged incidents. No one contends that either Bermudez or Gagne's father was prepared to testify about these incidents, or that there was any other \"proof.\" And Clark was prepared to refute these accusations, had Gagne been allowed to raise them.</p>\n<p>And, it bears emphasizing that the defense did <i>not</i> have \"only the Tony's Lounge incident as evidence\" that \"Clark consented to the activities of July 3\"; the defense had testimony by both Gagne and Swathwoodwhich is twice as much testimony as a rape defendant would typically haveand an opportunity to cross-examine the sole complainant, Pamela Clark. Moreover, the \"lack of other evidence\" did not hinder Gagne's defense; if anything it hindered the prosecution, whose burden it was to prove the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p>So, the majority is really saying that despite the absence of physical evidence, and despite Gagne's and Swathwood's consistent testimony that Clark consented, and despite their consistent testimony about the Tony's Lounge incident, and despite defense counsel's opportunity to cross-examine Clark at lengthGagne's self-serving and unverifiable testimony about those two other past, unrelated incidents of sexual debauchery on the part of his accuser, Pamela Clark, was \"<i>indispensable</i> to the jury's ability to assess the likelihood\" that she had consented to the far more violent and humiliating form of sexual debauchery with Gagne and Swathwood on the night in question. The majority contends: \"the excluded evidence was not just <i>relevant</i> to this case, it was in all likelihood the most relevant evidence regarding the sole contested issue at trial,\" consent.</p>\n<p>So, the majority's position is that \"the most relevant evidence\" in a rape trial, the \"indispensable\" evidence, is the perpetrator's testimony about the victim's promiscuity or prior sex acts. And this, according to the majority, is because a rape defendant has a constitutional right to prove present consent by producing evidence of past willingness, at least insofar as the defendant can characterize that evidence as highly relevant, noncumulative, and central to the dispute.</p>\n<p>I disagree and find that I am not alone. In <i>Sandoval v. Acevedo,</i> 996 F.2d 145, 147-48 (7th Cir.1993), the Seventh Circuit decided a case in which the defendantaccused of forcibly sodomizing his ex-girlfriend sought to introduce testimony by other men that she had enjoyed anal intercourse <span class=\"star-pagination\">*300</span> with them in the past, thus demonstrating her propensity for it. The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote>The essential insight behind the rape shield statute is that in an age of post-Victorian sexual practice, in which most unmarried young women are sexually active, the fact that a woman has voluntarily engaged in a particular sexual activity on previous occasions does not provide appreciable support for an inference that she consented to engage in this activity with the defendant on the occasion on which she claims that she was raped. And allowing defense counsel to spread the details of a woman's sex life on the public record not only causes embarrassment to the woman but by doing so makes it less likely that victims of rape will press charges.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 149. The Seventh Circuit continued:</p>\n<blockquote>The fact that [she] had had pleasurable anal intercourse with another man on another occasion would not show that she would have enjoyed having it with Sandoval on an occasion when he was enraged and wanted by penetrating her anally to humiliate and, quite possibly, physically hurt her. Indeed, by that logic rape shield laws would be unconstitutional to the core because their central aim is to prevent the drawing of an inference of consent from previous consensual intercourse with other men.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 151.</p>\n<blockquote>[E]ven without a rape shield law it is doubtful that testimony that she had enjoyed it with another man would be admissible, for it doesn't, or at least shouldn't, require a rape shield law to show that consent to sex with X on one occasion is not good evidence of consent to sex with Y on another.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> To extend this basic reasoning to the present case: it shouldn't require a rape shield law to show that consent to sex with X and Y on one occasion is not good evidence of consent to sex with X and Z on another. But, as so many states have discovered, it does require a rape-shield law, because too many peoplelike the majority heresuccumb to the \"propensity evidence\" problem.</p>\n<p>There is, to be sure, a commonplace assumption behind propensity evidence: <i>If she did it before, she's more likely to have done it again. Cf., e.g., </i><i>Old Chief v. United States,</i> 519 U.S. 172, 181, 117 S.Ct. 644, 136 L.Ed.2d 574 (1997); Fed.R.Evid. 404(b). And there is a peculiar aspect to propensity evidence in rape cases, in which evidence of the <i>victim's</i> sexual predilections e.g., a propensity for sexual willingness has historically been considered indicative of whether the victim consented to the incident in question. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Evid. 412. And this is an assumption that the Michigan legislature (like many others across the country) was attempting to overcome by enacting its rape shield statute.</p>\n<p>The Michigan legislature has declared such evidence generally inadmissible as a matter of public policy: that rape victims should be encouraged to report and prosecute rapes without fear that private, potentially embarrassing, incidents from their past will become the centerpiece of the ensuing trial. The majority disagrees and holds that the rape-shield statute is no bar to evidence of a rape victim's promiscuity or prior willingness to engage in sexual debauchery, if that evidence is \"highly relevant, noncumulative, and indispensable to the central dispute in a criminal trial.\"</p>\n<p>But, as the Seventh Circuit stated so cogently, \"by that logic rape shield laws would be unconstitutional to the core,\" <i>see </i><i>Sandoval,</i> 996 F.2d at 151, inasmuch as the very purpose of a rape-shield statute is to exclude, on policy grounds, evidence that is almost always highly relevant, non-cumulative, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*301</span> and indispensable to the central dispute in a criminal trial. If the majority wants to hold that rape-shield statutes are unconstitutional, it should do so forthrightly. At least, that way, we would have the issue front and center, with an opportunity for debate and dissent.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B.</h2>\n<p>I cannot agree that the Michigan Court of Appeals unreasonably applied any clearly established law, and I cannot join the majority opinion which, in effect, invalidates all rape shield laws as violative of the Sixth Amendment. Therefore, I respectfully dissent. I would reverse the district court's judgment and deny the petitioner's request for habeas relief.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  That statute provides as follows:\n</p>\n<p>Sec. 520b. (1) A person is guilty of criminal sexual conduct in the first degree if he or she engages in sexual penetration with another person and ...</p>\n<p>(f) The actor causes personal injury to the victim and force or coercion is used to accomplish sexual penetration.</p>\n<p>Mich.

Comp. Laws § 750.520j (1)(a).</p>\n<p>[3]  At this point Gagne and Swathwood's legal proceedings parted ways. Swathwood missed the deadline to apply for leave to appeal in the Michigan Supreme Court, so his application was denied. <i>See Swathwood v. Lafler,</i> No. 04-CV-72251, 2009 WL 322041, at *3 (E.D.Mich. Feb, 10, 2009). He also filed a habeas petition, but the court denied relief because his claims were procedurally defaulted due to his missing the deadline in the Michigan Supreme Court. <i>Id.</i> at *8.</p>\n<p>[4]  The parties do not argue that the Michigan courts violated AEDPA by basing their decision \"on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\" 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(2).</p>\n<p>[5]  It may also have impeachment purposes, but in our view, this purpose is less relevant than the substantive role this evidence would play, so we focus our analysis on the latter.</p>\n<p>[6]  Stout was present for at least some of the activity, but he testified that he was so intoxicated that he remembers nothing, a claim that is in line with Gagne, Swathwood, and Clark's accounts of Stout's general state of intoxication that night.</p>\n<p>[1]  <i>See</i> Fed.R.Evid. 412 (108 Stat. 1919, eff.

NORRIS, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>Petitioner Lewis Gagne and his co-defendant, Donald Swathwood, were each charged with three counts of criminal sexual misconduct for forcibly and simultaneously engaging in sexual activities with Gagne's ex-girlfriend, Pamela Clark. All of the charges arose out of events occurring over the course of one night. The key question at trial was one of consent. The jury convicted Gagne of two counts, and Swathwood of three. Gagne filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, 28 U.S.C. § 2254, and the district court granted him relief on the basis that the state trial court's decision to exclude certain evidence had violated Gagne's due process right to present a meaningful defense. Respondent, Warden Raymond Booker, represented by the Michigan Attorney General (\"the State\"), appealed. We now affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A.</h2>\n<p>Gagne and Swathwood were each charged with three counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct. Mich. Comp. Laws § 750.520b(1)(f).<sup>[1]</sup> Gagne's three <span class=\"star-pagination\">*280</span> charges included two counts of forcible penis to mouth penetration and one count of forcible penis to vagina penetration, charges for which consent is a full defense. <i>See </i><i>People v.

A jury convicted Gagne of forcible vaginal penetration and of one count of forcible oral penetration.</p>\n<p>The parties do not dispute the background facts that set the stage for what occurred on the night of July 3, 2000. The complainant, Clark, and Gagne dated from some time in January until early June of that year. Gagne moved in with Clark in late January or early February, and the two lived together until their relationship ended. Throughout this time, Clark worked, but Gagne did not, and Gagne would frequently use her work phone and her personal ATM card, sometimes without her knowledge.</p>\n<p>Also undisputed were the events that took place around midnight on July 3, 2000. After spending most of that day doing yardwork, during which time she consumed most of a pint of vodka, Clark retired to her house to watch television. Gagne arrived uninvited at about 10:45 p.m. He informed Clark that he and his friend Swathwood, whom Clark also knew, were going to move to California. Shortly thereafter Swathwood and a third man, Michael Stout, arrived. The group began drinking beer and possibly smoking marijuana. By Clark's own estimate she consumed nine or ten beers during this time.</p>\n<p>This point in the story marks the beginning of the facts contested at trial. We begin with the version urged by the prosecution, which was presented almost entirely through Clark's testimony. At some point after midnight, Clark and Gagne took a shower together. Afterwards, Clark, who believed that Swathwood and Stout had left, participated in oral sex with Gagne in the living room. Swathwood entered the room and began engaging in intercourse with her while Gagne forcibly held her head down. A few minutes later, Gagne released Clark and the two went into the bedroom where Clark told Gagne she did not want to have sex with Swathwood. Clark then began performing oral sex with Gagne. Swathwood again entered the room and began engaging in intercourse with her. The men held Clark down, and each had intercourse and oral sex with her, at various points slapping her buttocks and using sexual devices that Clark kept in her room.</p>\n<p>At approximately five a.m. the men tired of this activity and left the room. Clark went into the bathroom, vomited, took a shower, and returned to bed where she slept until approximately noon the next day. At that time she discovered her ATM card was missing, and upon further investigation learned that at 5:28 that morning someone had withdrawn $300 from her account, and had tried to withdraw more money twice in the following fifteen minutes.</p>\n<p>The defense's version of events differed primarily on the issue of consent. According to Gagne and Swathwood, the group purchased and smoked some crack cocaine at around midnight. Clark then began talking with the men about engaging in group sex, and in large part instigated the group sexual activity, first in the living room and then later in the bedroom. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*281</span> Their description of the sexual activities differed only in that Clark consented to them. They concede for instance, that they spanked Clark. At about five a.m. Gagne and Clark agreed that Gagne should leave and purchase more crack with money withdrawn using her ATM card. All three men left in Clark's car. Gagne dropped Stout off at home, withdrew $300 from an ATM using Clark's card, and then drove to a street corner and purchased crack. The defendants became nervous when they saw police cars in the area, so instead of returning home, they drove to a cemetery and smoked the crack. The defendants testified that they returned to Clark's house later that morning and Gagne returned her ATM card. Clark was angry and told Gagne to leave, so he did.</p>\n<p>Clark testified that, two days later, she told her adult son that she had been raped. She also told the police, and saw several doctors. The doctors noted that she had some bruising but no trauma to her wrists or shoulders, which are typically present after a sexual assault. Nor did any of the doctors find any internal or external tears to Clark's vagina or rectum.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B.</h2>\n<p>As noted above, at the heart of Gagne's petition for habeas corpus is the trial judge's exclusion of certain evidence from the trial. As required by the Michigan rape shield law, Mich. Comp. Laws § 750.520j(1) &amp; (2),<sup>[2]</sup> Gagne filed a motion <i>in limine</i> seeking to introduce evidence regarding several aspects of Clark's prior sexual experiences and tastes. The trial judge denied the motion in part, excluding evidence regarding two subjects that are relevant here: an incident of group sexual activity involving Gagne, Clark, and a man named Ruben Bermudez; and Clark's solicitation of Gagne's father to join her and Gagne in group sex. The court's exclusion of this evidence gives rise to this appeal.</p>\n<p>The court also granted Gagne's motion in part, and, because it is especially relevant to our analysis, we recount in some detail the evidence the court decided to admit regarding sexual activity that occurred one night involving Gagne, Swathwood, Clark, and two other females they met at a bar called Tony's Lounge (\"the Tony's Lounge incident\"). In the spring of 2000, Clark, Swathwood, and Gagne went to Tony's Lounge, where they drank for some time. At the bar Swathwood met two women. All five of them departed together and went to a house belonging to one of the women. There were people at the house when they arrived. Clark and Gagne began to engage in some sort of \"sexual behavior\" in the living room while Swathwood had intercourse nearby with the other two women. Clark testified that she did not \"engage in sex of whatever kind with Donny Swathwood\" while they were in the living room. When someone knocked at the door, Clark and Gagne relocated to the bedroom where they began alternately having intercourse and arguing. Swathwood brought the other women into the bedroom. Gagne and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*282</span> Clark's argument escalated, and finally Clark left and went home.</p>\n<p>Clark was extremely intoxicated during these events; she testified that she drove home that night but did not remember doing so. The next day, Gagne informed her that there was more from the previous night that she did not remember, including that she had engaged in oral sex with Swathwood. Clark testified that she had no memory of this. Nonetheless, she believed Gagne and told others what had happened with Swathwood, including Swathwood's girlfriend at the time.</p>\n<p>Finally, Clark testified that, at some later date, she and Gagne \"were talking about being with other men or being with other women\" sexually, and discussed the Tony's Lounge incident:</p>\n<blockquote>And I told him that, you know, I honestly have not been with any other man except what you told me about [Swathwood] and I don't remember that. And he said to me, I was just lying `cause I wanted to go to bed with the samethe girl that [Swathwood] was having sex with. And Iand then he told me that he did have sex with her that night. And shethe girl had told me something different.</blockquote>\n<p>For his part, Swathwood testified that Clark engaged in oral sex with him that night in the presence of Gagne and the other two women. Swathwood answered \"yes\" when asked, \"Fair assessment to say this was kind of a group-sex, orgy-type situation?\"</p>\n<p>In her closing argument, the prosecutor repeatedly emphasized the unlikeliness of the defendants' version of the story, which, in her words, was \"more consistent with the pornographic movie than real life.\" The defense responded by attacking Clark's credibility and arguing that she had consented by pointing to the Tony's Lounge incident as evidence of this theory. During rebuttal, the prosecution argued to the jury, that, insofar as the Tony's Lounge incident was concerned, \"Even if you believe, contrary to . . . what Ms. Clark told you, that she did engage in consen[s]ual sexual contact with Mr. Swathwood, the nature of the contact and relations here were 190 degrees [sic] different. That situation did not involve, ladies and gentlemen, two men.\"</p>\n<p>On direct appeal, Gagne raised a number of claims, only one of which is relevant here: that the trial court violated his due process right to present a defense when it excluded the evidence regarding the group sexual activity with Bermudez, and Clark's solicitation of Gagne's father to participate in group sex with her and Gagne.</p>\n<p>The state appellate court acknowledged that rape shield statutes can occasionally abridge a defendant's constitutional rights, but concluded that the evidence of the group sexual activity with Bermudez and the invitation to Gagne's father were irrelevant because they involved third parties, not Swathwood. <i>People v. Swathwood,</i> Nos. 235540 and 235541, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2003</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1880143</span></span>, at *1-2 (Mich.Ct.App. Apr.15, 2003). Additionally, the Bermudez incident was said to be even less relevant because it had occurred while Clark and Gagne were dating; by July 3, the couple had been separated for three weeks. <i>Id.</i> at *2. The court of appeals also determined that Gagne's constitutional rights were not violated because he was allowed to present evidence regarding the Tony's Lounge incident, which the court felt sufficiently demonstrated that Clark \"was not averse to group sexual activity.\" <i>Id.</i> at *3.</p>\n<p>The court of appeals affirmed Gagne and Swathwood's convictions and remanded for sentencing determinations that are irrelevant to this appeal. The state court proceedings ended when the Michigan Supreme <span class=\"star-pagination\">*283</span> Court denied Gagne leave to appeal.<sup>[3]</sup><i>People v. Gagne,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">469</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">982</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">673</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">755</span></span> (2003) (unpublished table decision).</p>\n<p>Gagne filed a <i>pro se</i> petition for a writ of habeas corpus, asserting four claims. The district court granted relief on the due process claim arising from the trial court's exclusion of evidence. The court determined that relief was warranted because the excluded evidence was highly relevant since it involved occurrences remarkable in their similarity to the events on the night of July 3. This evidence was crucial to the defense because this case was essentially a \"credibility contest\" between Clark on the one hand, and Gagne and Swathwood on the other. The court granted Gagne a conditional writ of habeas corpus, and the State timely appealed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>We review a district court's decision to grant habeas relief <i>de novo. </i><i>Hereford v.

Because Gagne filed his habeas petition after the enactment of the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\"AEDPA\"), Pub.L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214, we review the last reasoned state court decision on the issue to determine whether that decision \"was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\" or \"was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts.\" 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d). A state court's determination is contrary to clearly established federal law if \"the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by [the Supreme Court] on a question of law or if the state court decides a case differently than [the Supreme Court] has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.\" <i>Williams v.

In that case, the trial court excluded evidence of the circumstances surrounding the defendant's confession, which the defense argued would have cast doubt on the credibility of that confession. <i>Id.</i> at 684-86, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111687\"><a href=\"/opinion/111687/crane-v-kentucky/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2142</span></a></span>. The Supreme Court, in determining that this exclusion violated the defendant's right to present a meaningful defense, explained that the \"opportunity [to be heard] would be an empty one if the State were permitted to exclude competent, reliable evidence bearing on the credibility of a confession when such evidence is central to the defendant's claim of innocence.\" <i>Id.</i> at 690, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111687\"><a href=\"/opinion/111687/crane-v-kentucky/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2142</span></a></span>. The evidence, which related to the physical circumstances of the confession, was so \"highly relevant to [the] reliability and credibility\" of the confession, and the confession was so integral to the defense, that the excluded evidence was \"all but indispensable to any chance of [that defense] succeeding.\" <i>Id.</i> at 691, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111687\"><a href=\"/opinion/111687/crane-v-kentucky/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2142</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>In <i>Crane,</i> the Court's inquiry did not end with consideration of the defendant's interests. Rather, the Court sought to balance those interests against the state's interests in the evidentiary exclusion at issue; simplifying the Court's task was the fact that the state did not attempt to come forward with a justification for the questioned exclusion. <i>Crane,</i> 476 U.S. at 691, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111687\"><a href=\"/opinion/111687/crane-v-kentucky/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2142</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>Thus, <i>Crane</i> makes clear that a proper inquiry into the constitutionality of a court's decision to exclude evidence begins with considering the relevancy and cumulative nature of the excluded evidence, and the extent to which it was \"central\" or \"indispensable\" to the defense. Against this courts must balance the state's interests in enforcing the evidentiary rule on which the exclusion was based, in this case Michigan's rape shield statute.</p>\n<p>When applying this delicate balance to the Michigan rape shield statute, we do not write on a blank slate. The Supreme Court has already considered that statute and, in doing so, reiterated these competing considerations. <i>Michigan v. Lucas,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112590\"><a href=\"/opinion/112590/michigan-v-lucas/\"><span class=\"volume\">500</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">145</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112590\"><a href=\"/opinion/112590/michigan-v-lucas/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">205</span></a></span> (1991). In that case, the Court reviewed a holding of the Michigan Court of Appeals that the rape shield statute's \"notice-and-hearing requirement is unconstitutional in all cases where it is used to preclude evidence of past sexual conduct between a rape victim and a criminal defendant.\" <i>Id.</i> at 148, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112590\"><a href=\"/opinion/112590/michigan-v-lucas/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1743</span></a></span>. Among other provisions, the statute requires the accused to file \"a written motion and offer of proof\" within ten days of his arraignment if he plans to introduce evidence of the victim's past sexual conduct. Mich. Comp. Laws § 750.20j(2). In <i>Lucas,</i> the defendant failed to file the motion in a timely manner and the trial court excluded the evidence on that basis. The Supreme Court recognized that \"the [rape shield] <span class=\"star-pagination\">*285</span> statute unquestionably implicates the Sixth Amendment\" but also noted that placing limits on the ability to present a defense \"does not necessarily render the statute unconstitutional.\" <i>Lucas,</i> 500 U.S. at 149, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112590\"><a href=\"/opinion/112590/michigan-v-lucas/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1431</span></a></span>, that it relied upon in <i>Crane, supra,</i> the Court recognized the wide latitude enjoyed by trial judges to limit the introduction of evidence. <i>Id.</i> In the Court's view, the Michigan rape shield law \"represents a valid legislative determination that rape victims deserve heightened protection against surprise, harassment, and unnecessary invasions of privacy.\" <i>Id.</i> at 150, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112590\"><a href=\"/opinion/112590/michigan-v-lucas/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1743</span></a></span>. Given these competing considerations, the Court framed the question posed to it as follows: \"[W]hether the legitimate interests served by a notice requirement can ever justify precluding evidence of a prior sexual relationship between a rape victim and a criminal defendant.\" <i>Id.</i> at 151, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112590\"><a href=\"/opinion/112590/michigan-v-lucas/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Significantly in our view, it did not hold that preclusion of evidence for failure to comply with a notice provision is <i>always</i> appropriate. As in all of its cases balancing evidentiary considerations with the right to present a complete defense, the Court made clear that a case by case evaluation is required. Accordingly, it remanded for the Michigan courts to perform such a balancing and, in doing so, the Court \"express[ed] no opinion as to whether or not preclusion was justified in this case.\" <i>Id.</i> at 153, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112590\"><a href=\"/opinion/112590/michigan-v-lucas/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The writ may issue only when petitioner is \"in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States.\" 28 U.S.C. § 2241(c)(3). And, as we stressed earlier in this opinion, our task is not to reach our own independent conclusion regarding the constitutional validity of the evidentiary decision to exclude evidence; rather, we must determine if the last reasoned state court opinion was either contrary to or involved an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States. 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1).<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>The Michigan Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court's judgment. It acknowledged that evidentiary laws, including rape shield statutes, must give way when constitutional rights of the accused, specifically the Sixth Amendment right to confrontation, are implicated. <i>People v. Swathwood,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2003</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1880143</span></span>, at *1 (citing <i>People v. Hackett,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">421</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">338</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">365</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">120</span></span>, 124 (1984) (\"in certain limited situations, such evidence [of prior sexual conduct] may not only be relevant, but its admission may be required to preserve a defendant's constitutional right to confrontation\")). Balanced against these constitutional considerations, the court of appeals observed that the Michigan Supreme Court has instructed trial courts to be \"mindful of the significant legislative purposes underlying the rape-shield statute and should always favor exclusion of evidence of a complainant's sexual conduct where its exclusion would not unconstitutionally abridge the defendant's right to confrontation.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>People v. Adair,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1711295\"><a href=\"/opinion/1711295/people-v-adair/\"><span class=\"volume\">452</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">473</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1711295\"><a href=\"/opinion/1711295/people-v-adair/\"><span class=\"volume\">550</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">505</span></a></span>, 511 (1996) (quoting <i>Hackett,</i> 365 N.W.2d at 125)) (quotation marks omitted). The balance struck by the court <span class=\"star-pagination\">*286</span> of appeals in this case is entirely consistent with the approach taken by the United States Supreme Court in <i>Lucas.</i> While the Michigan Court of Appeals did not cite federal constitutional law in its decision, its rendition of the appropriate legal analysis was not \"contrary to\" the \"clearly established\" federal law reflected in either <i>Crane</i> or <i>Lucas.</i></p>\n<p>That being the case, the writ may issue only if the court of appeals unreasonably applied that law. 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1). We conclude that it did. With respect to the evidence regarding a \"threesome\" that included petitioner, Clark, and Bermudez, it reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>[T]he complainant's willing participation in a threesome with Gagne and Bermudez is not probative of whether she consented to a threesome with Gagne and Swathwood on the night of the alleged offense. Notably, the threesome involving Bermudez occurred while the complainant and Gagne were still dating. The instant offense occurred after they had ended their relationship, and it involved Swathwood, not Bermudez. In light of the lack of similarity between the Bermudez threesome and the instant offense, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the evidence.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Swathwood,</i> at *2. The court of appeals also observed that the jury heard at length about the group sexual activity that followed the visit to Tony's Lounge, which included Clark and multiple partners. <i>Id.</i> at *3. Thus, \"defendants presented evidence that the complainant was not averse to group sexual activity\" and \"the trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the evidence.\" <i>Id.</i> at *2-3. The court employed similar reasoning before reaching the same conclusion with respect to the invitation to Gagne's father to join in group sex. <i>Id.</i> at *3.</p>\n<p>In our view, the court of appeals underestimated the vital nature of the disputed material, which we believe to be highly relevant, primarily as substantive evidence on the issue of whether Clark consented to the sexual activity the night of July 3, 2000.<sup>[5]</sup> The State argues otherwise in its brief to this court; inferring Clark's consent from these past incidents is</p>\n<blockquote>the very inference that rape-shield laws are meant to avoid; that somehow consent to unrelated sexual activity is relevant to whether the victim consented to the charged offense. Like evidence of a defendant's prior criminal acts, governed by MRE and FRE 404(b), propensity evidence carries a significant danger of unfair inference and prejudice.</blockquote>\n<p>The State is correct that evidentiary rules generally disfavor showing a person's propensity for certain actions by introducing evidence of past similar acts, and it is further correct that in rape cases evidence regarding \"unrelated sexual activity\" is generally accepted as only minimally relevant to the question of consent. But rape shield laws, including Michigan's, almost universally except from this rule evidence regarding prior sexual activity <i>between the complainant and the defendant,</i> precisely because that evidence carries heightened relevancy due to its increased similarity to the instance of the alleged rape. <i>See</i> Mich. Comp. Laws § 750.520j(1)(a); <i>see also</i> Fed.R.Evid. 412(b)(1)(B). In this case, these prior incidents have significant relevance not only because Gagne and Clark were involved in them, but also because they are both remarkably similar to the events that occurred the night of July 3.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*287</span> Nor do we agree with the State that the excluded evidence was cumulative to the testimony already introduced regarding the Tony's Lounge incident. There are, of course, similarities between this evidence and the excluded evidence: if Swathwood's version of the Tony's Lounge incident is believed, then it demonstrates that Clark had, on at least one occasion, engaged in sexual activities of some variety with multiple partners over the course of one night; it also shows that she did so with Gagne and Swathwood. But we find the differences, which the prosecution took pains to highlight in closing argument, to be more significant. First, the evidence that Clark engaged in group sex during the Tony's Lounge incident is at best equivocal because Clark testified that she did not remember engaging in any sexual activities with Swathwood that night. She further testified that Gagne later told her that he had made up that part of the story. And although Swathwood testified that this had, in fact, occurred, it would have been obvious to the jury that he had reason to lie about this incident in order to show that Clark had engaged in these similar activities in the past. The prosecution realized that the jury might not believe Swathwood and argued in closing that Clark had not engaged in oral sex with Swathwood during the Tony's Lounge incident.</p>\n<p>Second, even if the jury did believe that Clark and Swathwood had engaged in some sexual activity that night, there is no evidence at all that Clark engaged in that activity with multiple partners at once. At most the evidence shows only that, at some point during that night, she engaged in sexual intercourse with Gagne, and, at another point during the night, she engaged in oral sex with Swathwood, and did so in the presence of other people. This kind of activity differs substantially from the activity that occurred the night of July 3, in which three people engaged in simultaneous group sex. The prosecution, in discussing the Tony's Lounge incident, pointed out this difference to the jury in closing: \"Even if you believe, contrary to. . . what Ms. Clark told you, that she did engage in consen[s]ual sexual contact with Mr. Swathwood, the nature of the contact and relations here were 190 degrees [sic] different. That situation did not involve, ladies and gentlemen, two men.\"</p>\n<p>Finally, even if the excluded evidence merely points to the same predilections shown by the Tony's Lounge incident, the entire trial hinged upon consent, so the <i>weight</i> of the evidence on this question is extremely important. This is evident from the closing arguments, in which the prosecutor repeatedly stressed the unlikeliness of Gagne's story, and told the jury that his story was \"much more consistent with the pornographic movie than real life.\" The defense's theory was that Clark consented to the activities of July 3, but it had only the Tony's Lounge incident as evidence that she may have done so. In our view, the exclusion of the evidence of the group sexual activity with Bermudez and the invitation to Gagne's father were indispensable to the jury's ability to assess the likelihood of this theory.</p>\n<p>We cannot accurately portray the extent of Gagne's interest in presenting this evidence without reference to the lack of other evidence in this case. Other than the two defendants and the complainant, there were no eyewitnesses at all.<sup>[6]</sup> Nor did the physical evidence tend weigh in favor of one side or the other. In short, the excluded evidence was not just <i>relevant</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*288</span> to this case, it was in all likelihood the most relevant evidence regarding the sole contested issue at trialan issue about which there was not much evidence in the first place. We believe it was indispensable to the defense's theory, a conclusion amply demonstrated by the consistent focus during closing arguments on what little evidence the court did admit regarding the likelihood (or unlikelihood) that Clark would have consented to the activity the night of July 3, 2000.</p>\n<p>With this in mind, we turn to the Michigan Supreme Court for an indication of the State's interests in enforcing the rape shield statute. As the court of appeals recognized, the Michigan Supreme Court has explained that those interests are two-fold: to encourage victims to report criminal activity and testify at trial; and to further the truth-finding process by preventing the admission of minimally relevant evidence that creates a significant risk of prejudice or confusion. <i>See </i><i>Adair,</i> 550 N.W.2d at 509. We have acknowledged that there is always a real risk that allowing evidence concerning a complainant's sexual history will turn the case into a trial of the victim instead of the defendant. <i>Lewis v. Wilkinson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"779454\"><a href=\"/opinion/779454/nathaniel-m-lewis-v-reginald-a-wilkinson-director-betty-d-montgomery/\"><span class=\"volume\">307</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">413</span></a></span>, 422 (6th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, we do not believe that admitting the evidence at issue in this case would overly frustrate the legitimate purposes of the rape shield statute. After all, the statute itself contains exceptions that demonstrate that the interests it usually serves must also accommodate the defendant's interest in the admission of evidence that is highly relevant, such as prior sexual conduct between the complainant and the defendant. While we are not reviewing the manner in which the Michigan courts applied the rape shield statute, which is a matter of state law, the fact that it contains this exception illustrates that the Michigan legislature recognized that the defendant has a heightened claim to the introduction of evidence of previous sexual contact with his accuser. This is not a case involving sex a decade before the subject incident. And what made the evidence even more central to petitioner's defense was the extraordinary nature of the events giving rise to the charge. The idea that someone could have consented to this sort of thing seems incredible absent proof that the person <i>had</i> consented to it before. Therein lies another similarity to <i>Crane.</i> In the underlying trial in <i>Crane</i> and in this case, the evidence that was admitted gave rise to a \"question every rational juror needs answered[.]\" 469 U.S. at 689, 105 S.Ct. 1005. In <i>Crane,</i> that question was, \"[i]f the defendant is innocent, why did he previously admit his guilt?\" <i>Id.</i> Here the question jurors would need to have answered if Gagne was to be acquitted was, \"how is it possible for anyone to consent to three-way sex of the kind described here?\" In each case the exclusion of evidence \"effectively disabled\" the defendant from answering the question. <i>Id.</i> Moreover, in this case, the excluded evidence would not have been unfairly prejudicial given the sexually graphic testimony that had already been admitted as well as the testimony involving the use of crack cocaine and other narcotics. And as we pointed out in <i>Lewis,</i> \"the court could minimize any danger of undue prejudice by admitting the evidence with a cautionary instruction and strictly limiting the scope of cross-examination.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Finally, we stress that our holding is fact-bound in the extreme: under the circumstances present here, the exclusion of evidence of the complainant's consensual three-way sex with the defendant only a month before the subject incident, in a three-way rape case in which extensive evidence of the victim's sexual conduct had already been admitted at trial, and where <span class=\"star-pagination\">*289</span> the question of guilt or innocence turned almost entirely on the credibility of the victim's testimony regarding consent, was an unreasonable application of the principles set forth by the Supreme Court in <i>Crane.</i> That case made clear that a defendant's constitutional right to present a defense, arising from the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, entails the right to put before the jury evidence which is highly relevant, non-cumulative, and indispensable to the central dispute in a criminal trial. This conclusion is also consistent with <i>Lucas,</i> a case in which the Court recognized that the Michigan rape shield statute implicates the Sixth Amendment rights of the accused and therefore its application must be carefully balanced against the legitimate interests served by the statute on a case by case basis. <i>Lucas,</i> 500 U.S. at 149, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112590\"><a href=\"/opinion/112590/michigan-v-lucas/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1743</span></a></span>. Reliance upon those legitimate interests in this case to exclude the incidents at issue runs contrary to the statute's exception that would allow a defendantin this case petitioner to present evidence of the victim's past sexual conduct with the actor. Mich. Comp. Laws § 750.520j. While the trial judge may exclude such evidence if its inflammatory or prejudicial nature outweighs its probative value, that discretion cannot trump the constitutional right of the accused to present evidence that is so \"highly relevant\" that its introduction, as in this case, is \"indispensable\" to the defense. <i>Crane,</i> 476 U.S. at 691, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111687\"><a href=\"/opinion/111687/crane-v-kentucky/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2142</span></a></span>. For these reasons, we hold that the Michigan Court of Appeals opinion constitutes an \"unreasonable application of[] clearly established Federal law,\" 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1), that deprived petitioner of his constitutional right to \"a meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense\" as articulated by the Supreme Court in <i>Crane.</i> The writ shall issue.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>V.</h2>\n<p>The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p>KETHLEDGE, Circuit Judge, concurring.</p>\n<p>It is hard for a court to invalidate a provision that does not even apply to the case at hand. It is harder still to invalidate a whole gaggle of provisions that actually support the result reached in the case. Yet that, according to the rhetoric in support of the State's petition for rehearing, is the feat we have managed here. I think the rhetoric is seriously overblown.</p>\n<p>We are told, in support of rehearing, that our decision effectively invalidates every rape-shield law in this circuit. That argument cannot be squared with the text of those laws. The core of any rape-shield law is its proscription against evidence of past sexual activity by the victim. But every one of those lawsor at least every one we are said to have vaporized here contains an exception for evidence of the victim's prior sexual activity <i>with the defendant.</i> And that is exactly the kind of evidence that we hold should have been admitted in this case. Michigan's statute excepts from its proscription \"[e]vidence of the victim's past sexual conduct with the actor.\" Mich. Comp. Laws § 750.520j(1)(a). Ohio's statute does the same. <i>See</i> Ohio Rev.Code § 2907.02(D) (excepting evidence of \"the victim's past sexual activity with the offender\"). So does the Tennessee rule. <i>See</i> Tenn. R. Evid. 412(c)(3) (allowing admission of evidence of \"sexual behavior . . . with the accused, on the issue of consent\"). The federal rule affirmatively provides that \"evidence of specific instances of sexual behavior\" between the alleged victim and defendant \"<i>is</i> admissible,\" if offered to prove consent and otherwise admissible under the rules. Fed.R.Evid. 412(b)(1)(B) <span class=\"star-pagination\">*290</span> (emphasis added). Kentucky's rule is identical to the federal one. <i>See</i> Ky. R. Evid. 412(b)(1)(B). I am of course mindful that we apply only constitutional rules, not statutory ones, on habeas review. But rhetorically speaking, our decision applies these laws, rather than abrogates them.</p>\n<p>Equally misdirected is the claim that we have trampled upon the policies that animate these laws. As Judge Norris's opinion carefully explains, we hold that, under the rather extraordinary facts presented here, certain evidence of the complainant's prior consensual sex with the defendant was indispensable to his ability to present a complete defense at trial. The argument now is that, in deeming that evidence indispensable, we have indulged in outdated inferences whose eradication was a principal aim of these laws. But the argument again is let down by the laws. Every one of these laws is supported by significant state interests. (The extent to which those interests are implicated in a particular case, as discussed below, is another matter.) And yet, notwithstanding those important interests, every one of these laws contains an exception for evidence of consensual sex with the defendant. These laws must infer something very important about such evidence; and they do so especially in caseslike this onewhere consent itself is the issue. The inference is that, in some (and perhaps most) cases, evidence of past consensual sex with the defendant is highly relevant to the issue of consent in the incident giving rise to the charge. We merely conclude that this is such a case.</p>\n<p>Notable as well is that the caselaw in Michigan, and the terms of the federal and Tennessee rules, expressly wave off the rape-shield proscription as to \"evidence the exclusion of which would violate the constitutional rights of the defendant.\" Fed.R.Evid. 412(b)(1)(C); <i>see also </i><i>People v.

What we do say, as a starting point for the analysis, is that <i>Crane</i> clearly establishes that \"the Constitution guarantees criminal defendants `a meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 690, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111687\"><a href=\"/opinion/111687/crane-v-kentucky/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

That point is a serious one; the more general a rule, the more difficult it is to say that the state court unreasonably applied the rule to a particular set of facts. With generality often comes discretion. But I think the facts of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*291</span> <i>Crane</i> and those of this case converge at a level closer to the ground than the State realizes.</p>\n<p><i>Crane</i> requires consideration of two factors in determining whether the exclusion of evidence denies the defendant a meaningful right to present a complete defense. The first is the extent to which the evidence was \"central to the defendant's claim of innocence.\" <i>Id.</i> The second is the extent to which its exclusion was supported by a \"valid state justification[.]\" <i>Id.</i> In <i>Crane,</i> the defendant was convicted of murder. He was 16 years old at the time of the crime. There was \"no physical evidence to link him\" to the murder. <i>Id.</i> at 691, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111687\"><a href=\"/opinion/111687/crane-v-kentucky/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2142</span></a></span>. The State's evidence of guilt was primarily Crane's own confession. Crane sought to discredit the confession with testimony that \"he had been detained in a windowless room for a protracted period of time, that he had been surrounded by as many as six police officers during the interrogation, that he had repeatedly requested and been denied permission to telephone his mother, and that he had been badgered into making a false confession.\" <i>Id.</i> at 685, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111687\"><a href=\"/opinion/111687/crane-v-kentucky/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2142</span></a></span>. That evidence, the Supreme Court said, was \"highly relevant\" to the reliability and credibility of the confession, which again was the State's primary evidence of guilt. <i>Id.</i> at 691, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111687\"><a href=\"/opinion/111687/crane-v-kentucky/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2142</span></a></span>. And the Court saw no justification for excluding the evidence under the circumstances presented there. The Court did not \"pass on the strength or merits\" of Crane's defense. <i>Id.</i> But it held, unanimously, that the exclusion of Crane's testimony violated his right to present a complete defense.</p>\n<p>The analysis flows in the same channels here. First, the excluded evidence was \"central to the defendant's claim of innocence.\" <i>Id.</i> at 690, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111687\"><a href=\"/opinion/111687/crane-v-kentucky/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2142</span></a></span>. Gagne was convicted of forcing Clark to engage in an outlandish sexual encounter with himself and another man. The events making up that encounter were largely undisputed; what was disputed was whether Clark consented. There was little if any physical evidence of non-consent. The State's primary evidence of guilt, rather, was Clark's own testimony that she did not consent. Gagne sought to discredit that testimony with evidence thatonly one month before the subject incidentClark had voluntarily engaged in three-way sex with Gagne and another man, and that she had suggested the same thing on another occasion. That evidence would have included testimony not only from Gagne, but also from Ruben Bermudez, the other participant in the three-way the month before, who according to Gagne's lawyer was prepared to testify at trial. <i>See</i> 1/2/01 Hearing Tr. 18-19. But the trial court excluded all of that testimony. That exclusion was affirmed by the state court of appeals, which held remarkablythat the excluded testimony was not even relevant to the case.</p>\n<p>That the excluded evidence was highly relevant can be inferred, as discussed above, from the rape-shield statutes themselves. Moreover, as Judge Norris explains, in both this case and <i>Crane</i> the excluded evidence, if credited, answers a question that, if left unanswered, leads directly to conviction. <i>See</i> Maj. Op. at ___-___.</p>\n<p>The State says the trial court's admission of evidence of another sexual encounterthe so-called Tony's Lounge incident, which involved five peoplemade the three-way evidence only marginal, rather than central, to Gagne's defense. But the prosecution itself did a credible job of explaining, in closing argument, why the Tony's Lounge evidence did very little to answer the question described above. I think that Judge Norris's opinion convincingly finishes the job.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*292</span> What <i>is</i> significant is the effect of the Tony's Lounge evidence upon the State's interest in excluding the Gagne and Bermudez three-way testimony. This, in my view, is where the bottom falls out of the State's argument on appeal. As an initial matter, this case only weakly implicates the interests protected by Michigan's rape-shield statute, since the statute's terms did not even bar the excluded testimony, but instead left its admission to the discretion of the Ingham County Circuit Judge. <i>See</i> Mich. Comp. Laws § 750.520j (1)(a). And it is hard to see what was left of those interests, such as they were in this case, given the evidence that <i>was</i> admitted at trial. That evidence included that, during the Tony's Lounge incident, Clark had engaged in oral sex with Swathwood shortly after intercourse with Gagne, and that she had engaged in consensual oral sex with Gagne minutes before the very incident for which he was convicted (and moreover that she had drunk a pint of vodka and nine or so beers and smoked crack in the hours before the incident). I entirely agree that Michigan's rape-shield law protects important state interests in the vast majority of cases in which it is implicated. But I submit that, under the circumstances of this trial, there was virtually nothing left of those interests to protect.</p>\n<p>So here, as in <i>Crane,</i> the prosecution's case hinged on a single account of what happened during the underlying incident. In each case, the nature of that accounta confession there, and the outlandish conduct alleged to have been coerced here tended to make the account especially persuasive to a jury. In each case, the trial court excluded highly relevant evidence that, if credited, could have undermined the account upon which the State relied. And in each case the State's interest in excluding that evidence was negligible.</p>\n<p>These parallels emerge, admittedly, only after close analysis. But I think they are clear enough to render the state court's decision unreasonable within the meaning of the habeas statute. (It bears mention that two Justices of the Michigan Supreme Court voted to reverse the decision summarily, and that Justice Markman voted to hear the case. <i>See</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">469</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">982</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">673</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">755</span></span> (Mich.2003) (unpublished table disposition).) The exclusion of the three-way evidence clearly violated Gagne's Sixth Amendment and procedural due process rights. He should have been able to present that evidence to a jury before ultimately being sentenced to a prison term of up to 45 years.</p>\n<p>My purpose in reciting this evidence, however, is not to explain what Judge Norris has already explained in his nuanced opinion. And I readily admit that reasonable people, including the respected Chief Judge of our court, can disagree with my conclusion in this case. Nor do I mean to \"pass on the strength or merits\" of Gagne's defense. <i>Crane,</i> 476 U.S. at 691, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111687\"><a href=\"/opinion/111687/crane-v-kentucky/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2142</span></a></span>. I think those merits should have been left to the jury; and otherwise I do not hold a torch for anyone involved in the underlying events of this case.</p>\n<p>My purpose, instead, is to emphasize the limited nature of our holding in this case. <i>See also</i> Maj. Op. at ___-___. With respect, I do not think that holding has nearly the jurisprudential consequences that Michigan and the amici States seem to think it has.</p>\n<p>For these reasons, I continue to concur fully in Judge Norris's opinion.</p>\n<p>ALICE M. BATCHELDER, Chief Judge, dissenting.</p>\n<p>Some 35 years ago, the Michigan state legislature determined that a criminal defendant accused of rape may not introduce <span class=\"star-pagination\">*293</span> evidence about the victim's past sexual behavior, because the victim's past willingness is not relevant to the question of present consent. The majority here disagrees with that legislative determination and concludes that evidence of the victim's promiscuity or previous willingness to engage in somewhat similar sex acts was not only relevant but was \"indispensable\" and \"the most relevant evidence.\" Moreover, because this appeal arises in the context of a habeas proceeding, the majority ultimately holds that the rape defendant has a \"constitutionally protected\" and \"clearly established\" right to introduce this evidence. In so holding, the majority effectively abrogates every rape-shield statute in this circuit.<sup>[1]</sup> I do not believe that there is any such constitutional right to present evidence of a rape victim's promiscuity or past willingness to engage in sex acts, nor do I believe that the majority is justified in its condemnation of the rape-shield concept. I dissent.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A.</h2>\n<p>In concluding its analysis, and justifying its grant of habeas relief, the majority cites <i>Crane v. Kentucky,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111687\"><a href=\"/opinion/111687/crane-v-kentucky/\"><span class=\"volume\">476</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">683</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111687\"><a href=\"/opinion/111687/crane-v-kentucky/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">636</span></a></span> (1986), as the \"clearly established law\" that the Michigan Court of Appeals \"unreasonably applied.\" <i>See</i> Maj. Op. at ___ (\"We therefore conclude that the state appellate court's determination on this issue was an unreasonable application of the principles set forth by the Supreme Court in <i>Crane.</i>\"). The majority offers the following exposition of those \"principles\":</p>\n<blockquote>\n<i>Crane makes clear</i> that a proper inquiry into the <i>constitutionality</i> of a court's decision to exclude evidence begins with considering the relevancy and cumulative nature of the excluded evidence, and the extent to which it was `central' or `indispensable' to the defense. Against this courts must balance the state's interests in enforcing the evidentiary rule on which the exclusion was based, in this case Michigan's rape shield statute.</blockquote>\n<p>Maj. Op. at ___ (underlining added) (citing <i>Crane,</i> 476 U.S. at 691, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111687\"><a href=\"/opinion/111687/crane-v-kentucky/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2142</span></a></span>). So, according to the majority, <i>Crane</i> stands for the clear proposition that if a defendant accused of rape can show that evidence of the rape victim's promiscuity or prior willingness to perform sex acts is \"highly relevant, non-cumulative, and indispensable to the central dispute in a criminal trial,\" then that defendant has a <i>constitutional right</i> to \"put [that evidence] before the jury.\" Maj. Op. at ___.</p>\n<p>I cannot accept this proposition. Foremost, I do not agree with its constitutional premise. That is, in light of <i>Michigan v. Lucas,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112590\"><a href=\"/opinion/112590/michigan-v-lucas/\"><span class=\"volume\">500</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">145</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112590\"><a href=\"/opinion/112590/michigan-v-lucas/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">205</span></a></span> (1991), I do not believe that there is any such constitutional right. But, even if I am mistaken in my reading of <i>Lucas,</i> I cannot agree that this proposition wasor, indeed, is now\"clearly established\" as Supreme Court precedent, and I do not agree that such a liberal extension of <i>Crane</i> is justified (or justifiable). Moreover, I cannot agree that the Michigan Court of Appeals's application of these governing principles (such as they are) was \"objectively unreasonable.\" Finally, I am simply unwilling to sanction the inevitable, albeit unacknowledged, consequence of this decisionthat rape-shield statutes are <i>ipso facto</i> unconstitutional, inasmuch as their very purpose is to exclude, on policy grounds, evidence that is almost <span class=\"star-pagination\">*294</span> always \"highly relevant, non-cumulative, and indispensable to the central dispute in a criminal trial.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1.</h2>\n<p>In <i>Lucas,</i> 500 U.S. at 147, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112590\"><a href=\"/opinion/112590/michigan-v-lucas/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1743</span></a></span>, the Michigan prosecutor charged Nolan Lucas with criminal sexual conduct based on his ex-girlfriend's accusation that he forced her to his apartment at knife point and forced her to perform various sex acts against her will. <i>Id.</i> at 147, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112590\"><a href=\"/opinion/112590/michigan-v-lucas/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1743</span></a></span>. Lucas and the ex-girlfriend had ended a six-to-seven month relationship just two weeks earlier and Lucas insisted that the entire episode was consensual, that he had not used a knife or any other force. <i>See </i><i>Michigan v. Lucas,</i> 160 Mich.App. 692, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2070596\"><a href=\"/opinion/2070596/people-v-lucas/\"><span class=\"volume\">408</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">431</span></a></span>, 431-32 (1987). At trial, the ex-girlfriend claimed rape and Lucas claimed consent. <i>See Michigan v.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1743</span></a></span>. The trial court agreed that Lucas's counsel had failed to comply with the notice provision of the rape-shield statute and refused to admit the evidence. <i>Id.</i> at 148, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112590\"><a href=\"/opinion/112590/michigan-v-lucas/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1743</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>After being convicted and sentenced, Lucas appealed. <i>Id.</i> The Michigan Court of Appeals vacated the conviction, holding \"that the [Michigan rape-shield statute]'s notice-and-hearing requirement is unconstitutional in all cases where it is used to preclude evidence of past sexual conduct between a rape victim and a criminal defendant.\" <i>Id.</i> The United State Supreme Court granted certiorari to decide this constitutional question and ultimately concluded:</p>\n<blockquote>[T]he Michigan Court of Appeals erred in adopting a <i>per se</i> rule that Michigan's notice-and-hearing requirement violates the Sixth Amendment in all cases where it is used to preclude evidence of past sexual conduct between a rape victim and a defendant. The Sixth Amendment is not so rigid. The notice-and-hearing requirement serves legitimate state interests in protecting against surprise, harassment, and undue delay. Failure to comply with this requirement may in some cases justify even the severe sanction of preclusion.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 152-53, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112590\"><a href=\"/opinion/112590/michigan-v-lucas/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1743</span></a></span>. The Supreme Court vacated the judgment and remanded the case, stating:</p>\n<blockquote>We leave it to the Michigan courts to address in the first instance whether Michigan's rape-shield statute authorizes preclusion and whether, on the facts of this case, preclusion violated Lucas' rights under the Sixth Amendment.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 153, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112590\"><a href=\"/opinion/112590/michigan-v-lucas/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1743</span></a></span>. So, the Supreme Court expressly did not decide the preclusion question, which is the question before us here. And, the inescapable consequence of this <i>non</i>-decisionthe avoidance of this particular questionis that the Court has not articulated any \"clearly established\" law on this issue.</p>\n<p>In the present case, however, the Michigan courts did consider whether Michigan's rape-shield statute authorizes preclusion and determined, on the facts of <i>this</i> case, that preclusion of certain testimony concerning Ms. Clark's alleged prior sexual activities did not violate defendant Gagne's rights under the Sixth Amendment. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*295</span> Because the <i>Lucas</i> Court had left this issue unresolved, <i>Lucas</i> offers little direct guidance on this issue (i.e., <i>Lucas</i> did not \"clearly establish\" any law on this particular issue), but it certainly offers some guidance, the most telling of which comes from what it did <i>not</i> hold.</p>\n<p>The <i>Lucas</i> Court did not hold what the majority holds todaythat a defendant has a constitutional right to put evidence before the jury because the evidence was highly relevant, non-cumulative, and indispensable to the central dispute. If the evidence at issue in the present case was highly relevant, non-cumulative, and indispensable to the central dispute, then the evidence in <i>Lucas</i> was equally or more so. In the present case, the evidence concerned the victim's alleged willingness to participate in a particular sexual practice on at least two prior occasions; in <i>Lucas,</i> the evidence concerned the victim's six-to-seven month relationship with the defendant, the emotional, physical, and sexual nature of their relationship, and the patterns and practices incident thereto. If the former is \"highly relevant,\" then so must be the latter. In the present case, the court excluded two incidents of prior sexual activities, but admitted testimony about three others; in <i>Lucas,</i> the court excluded any reference whatsoever to the prior sexual relationship. If the former is \"non-cumulative,\" so must be the latter. And, finally, the central issue in the present case was the defendant's asserted defense of consent, which was also the central issue in <i>Lucas.</i> If evidence concerning consent in the former is \"indispensable to the central dispute,\" so it must be in the latter.</p>\n<p>So, it bears emphasizing that even though the evidence in <i>Lucas</i> was clearly \"highly relevant, non-cumulative, and indispensable to the central dispute in a criminal trial,\" <i>see</i> Maj. Op. at ___, the <i>Lucas</i> Court <i>did not hold</i>and did not even suggestthat the defendant therefore had some over-arching <i>constitutional right</i> to \"put [that evidence] before the jury,\" <i>see</i> Maj. Op. at ___. In fact, the <i>Lucas</i> Court implicitly rejected any such right, holding instead that the defendant's \"[f]ailure to comply with [the notice] requirement may in some cases justify even the severe sanction of preclu[ding]\" such highly relevant, non-cumulative, and indispensable evidence. <i>See </i><i>Lucas,</i> 500 U.S. at 153, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112590\"><a href=\"/opinion/112590/michigan-v-lucas/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1743</span></a></span>. It is perhaps just as important that the <i>Lucas</i> Court expressly left it to the Michigan courts to decide \"whether, on the facts of this case, preclusion [of the propensity evidence] violated Lucas' rights under the Sixth Amendment.\" <i>See id.</i> The majority notes that \"rape shield laws, including Michigan's, almost universally except from this rule evidence regarding prior sexual activity <i>between the complainant and the defendant,</i> precisely because that evidence carries heightened relevancy due to its increased similarity to the instance of the alleged rape.\" Maj. Op. at ___ (emphasis in original). But in <i>Lucas,</i> it was exactly that type of sexual-history evidence that had been precluded.</p>\n<p>So, the clear implication of <i>Lucas</i> is that the trial court can, without running afoul of the Constitution, exclude highly relevant, non-cumulative, and indispensable evidence from a criminal defendant's trial. That is, <i>Lucas</i> clearly demonstrates that a court <i>can</i> constitutionally exclude such evidence on the basis that the defendant's attorney failed to comply with the statute's notice requirement. Therefore, the right (such as it is) to put that evidence before the jury is not grounded in the Constitution, but is instead grounded in state law or the state's proper application of that law. <i>Cf. </i><i>Dist.

Thus, the Court explained, such \"a defendant's case may stand or fall on his ability to convince the jury that the manner in which the confession was obtained casts doubt on its credibility.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<blockquote>This simple insight is reflected in a federal statute, 18 U.S.C. § 3501(a), the Federal Rules of Evidence, Fed. Rule Evid. 104(e), and the statutory and decisional law of virtually every State in the Nation [citations omitted]. We recognize, of course, that under our federal system even a consensus as broad as this one is not inevitably congruent with the dictates of the Constitution. We acknowledge also our traditional reluctance to impose constitutional constraints on ordinary evidentiary rulings by state trial courts. In any given criminal case the trial judge is called upon to make dozens, sometimes hundreds, of decisions concerning the admissibility of evidence. As we reaffirmed earlier this Term, the Constitution leaves to the judges who must make these decisions wide latitude to exclude evidence that is repetitive, only marginally relevant[,] or poses an undue risk of harassment, prejudice, or confusion of the issues. Moreover, we have never questioned the power of States to exclude evidence through the application of evidentiary rules that themselves serve the interests of fairness and reliabilityeven if the defendant would prefer to see that evidence admitted. Nonetheless, without signaling any diminution in the respect traditionally accorded to the States in the establishment and implementation of their own criminal trial rules and procedures, we have little trouble concluding <i>on the facts of this case that the blanket exclusion of the proffered testimony about the circumstances of petitioner's confession deprived him of a fair trial.</i>\n</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 689-90, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111687\"><a href=\"/opinion/111687/crane-v-kentucky/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

It is noteworthy that, although it cited Holmes, the majority here did not hold that the Michigan rape-shield statute is \"arbitrary\" or that the Michigan Court of Appeals failed to \"advance[] any rational justification\" for its exclusion of the sexual propensity evidence.</p>\n<p>The majority cites <i>Crane</i> as the \"clearly established law\" that the Michigan Court of Appeals \"unreasonably applied\" in this case. <i>See</i> Maj. Op. at ___ (\"We therefore conclude that the state appellate court's determination on this issue was an unreasonable application of the principles set forth by the Supreme Court in <i>Crane.</i>\"). That is, the majority views <i>Crane</i>a decision that upheld a criminal defendant's constitutional right to introduce evidence about the circumstances surrounding <i>his own</i> (allegedly coerced) pre-trial confession as the \"clearly established\" or governing law on the constitutionality of a criminal defendant's right to introduce evidence about the <i>victim</i>'s prior willingness to participate in certain private, potentially humiliating, sex acts, based on the defendant's theory that her previous willingness would be indicative of her current willingness.</p>\n<p>I do not agree that the majority's rendition of <i>Crane</i> is or was \"clearly established.\" In my view, the majority has extended <i>Crane</i> well beyond any reading or application justified by the language of the opinion or any subsequent case. It is unfair to fault the Michigan Court of Appeals, as the majority does, for failing to anticipate this novel extension of <i>Crane.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3.</h2>\n<p>The majority's approach does not comply with the limitations of AEDPA.

The court explained its approach:</p>\n<blockquote>Evidence of specific instances of a victim's past sexual conduct with others is generally legally irrelevant and inadmissible under the rape-shield statute, M.C.L. § 750.520j. In certain limited situations, evidence that does not come within the specific exceptions of the statute may be relevant and its admission required to preserve a criminal defendant's Sixth Amendment right of confrontation.. . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Inquiries into sex histories, even when minimally relevant, carry a danger of unfairly prejudicing and misleading the jury. Application of the rape-shield statute must be done on a case-by-case basis, and the balance between the rights of the victim and the defendant must be weighed anew in each case. In exercising its discretion, the trial court should be mindful of the significant legislative purposes underlying the rape-shield statute and should always favor exclusion of evidence of a complainant's sexual conduct where its exclusion would not unconstitutionally abridge the defendant's right to confrontation.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Michigan v.

The court considered the evidence and, concluding that evidence of Ms. Clark's propensity to participate in certain sex acts was not probative of whether she consented to the acts complained of in the present case, affirmed the trial court. <i>Id.</i> at *2-4.</p>\n<p>I cannot agree that the Michigan Court of Appeals's application of the governing principles was \"objectively unreasonable.\" It appears to me that the majority does not dispute the state court's application of the law so much as it simply disagrees with either the Michigan legislature's policy determination about the relevance of this propensity evidence or with the state court's measure of the probity or relevance of this evidence. Neither is a proper basis for habeas relief.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>4.</h2>\n<p>It is commonly understood that the uncorroborated testimony of a rape victim is sufficient to support a conviction. <i>See </i><i>Tibbs v.

But, the majority is not so easily persuaded.</p>\n<blockquote>The defense's theory was that Clark consented to the activities of July 3, but <span class=\"star-pagination\">*299</span> it had only the Tony's Lounge incident as evidence that she may have done so. In our view, the exclusion of the evidence of the group sexual activity with Bermudez and the invitation to Gagne's father were indispensable to the jury's ability to assess the likelihood of this theory. We cannot accurately portray the extent of Gagne's interest in presenting this evidence without reference to the lack of other evidence in this case. Other than the two defendants and the complainant, there were no eyewitnesses at all. Nor did the physical evidence tend weigh in favor of one side or the other. In short, the excluded evidence was not just <i>relevant</i> to this case, it was in all likelihood the most relevant evidence regarding the sole contested issue at trialan issue about which there was not much evidence in the first place. We believe it was indispensable to the defense's theory. . . .</blockquote>\n<p>Maj. Op. at ___-___ (paragraph break and footnote omitted).</p>\n<p>First, let's be very clear about what the majority means when it says \"evidence of the group sexual activity with Bermudez and the invitation to Gagne's father.\" This \"evidence\" is simply Gagne's uncorroborated testimony about these alleged incidents. No one contends that either Bermudez or Gagne's father was prepared to testify about these incidents, or that there was any other \"proof.\" And Clark was prepared to refute these accusations, had Gagne been allowed to raise them.</p>\n<p>And, it bears emphasizing that the defense did <i>not</i> have \"only the Tony's Lounge incident as evidence\" that \"Clark consented to the activities of July 3\"; the defense had testimony by both Gagne and Swathwoodwhich is twice as much testimony as a rape defendant would typically haveand an opportunity to cross-examine the sole complainant, Pamela Clark. Moreover, the \"lack of other evidence\" did not hinder Gagne's defense; if anything it hindered the prosecution, whose burden it was to prove the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p>So, the majority is really saying that despite the absence of physical evidence, and despite Gagne's and Swathwood's consistent testimony that Clark consented, and despite their consistent testimony about the Tony's Lounge incident, and despite defense counsel's opportunity to cross-examine Clark at lengthGagne's self-serving and unverifiable testimony about those two other past, unrelated incidents of sexual debauchery on the part of his accuser, Pamela Clark, was \"<i>indispensable</i> to the jury's ability to assess the likelihood\" that she had consented to the far more violent and humiliating form of sexual debauchery with Gagne and Swathwood on the night in question. The majority contends: \"the excluded evidence was not just <i>relevant</i> to this case, it was in all likelihood the most relevant evidence regarding the sole contested issue at trial,\" consent.</p>\n<p>So, the majority's position is that \"the most relevant evidence\" in a rape trial, the \"indispensable\" evidence, is the perpetrator's testimony about the victim's promiscuity or prior sex acts. And this, according to the majority, is because a rape defendant has a constitutional right to prove present consent by producing evidence of past willingness, at least insofar as the defendant can characterize that evidence as highly relevant, noncumulative, and central to the dispute.</p>\n<p>I disagree and find that I am not alone. In <i>Sandoval v. Acevedo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"609250\"><a href=\"/opinion/609250/santiago-sandoval-v-gerado-acevedo-warden-of-east-moline-correctional/\"><span class=\"volume\">996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">145</span></a></span>, 147-48 (7th Cir.1993), the Seventh Circuit decided a case in which the defendantaccused of forcibly sodomizing his ex-girlfriend sought to introduce testimony by other men that she had enjoyed anal intercourse <span class=\"star-pagination\">*300</span> with them in the past, thus demonstrating her propensity for it. The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote>The essential insight behind the rape shield statute is that in an age of post-Victorian sexual practice, in which most unmarried young women are sexually active, the fact that a woman has voluntarily engaged in a particular sexual activity on previous occasions does not provide appreciable support for an inference that she consented to engage in this activity with the defendant on the occasion on which she claims that she was raped. And allowing defense counsel to spread the details of a woman's sex life on the public record not only causes embarrassment to the woman but by doing so makes it less likely that victims of rape will press charges.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 149. The Seventh Circuit continued:</p>\n<blockquote>The fact that [she] had had pleasurable anal intercourse with another man on another occasion would not show that she would have enjoyed having it with Sandoval on an occasion when he was enraged and wanted by penetrating her anally to humiliate and, quite possibly, physically hurt her. Indeed, by that logic rape shield laws would be unconstitutional to the core because their central aim is to prevent the drawing of an inference of consent from previous consensual intercourse with other men.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 151.</p>\n<blockquote>[E]ven without a rape shield law it is doubtful that testimony that she had enjoyed it with another man would be admissible, for it doesn't, or at least shouldn't, require a rape shield law to show that consent to sex with X on one occasion is not good evidence of consent to sex with Y on another.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> To extend this basic reasoning to the present case: it shouldn't require a rape shield law to show that consent to sex with X and Y on one occasion is not good evidence of consent to sex with X and Z on another. But, as so many states have discovered, it does require a rape-shield law, because too many peoplelike the majority heresuccumb to the \"propensity evidence\" problem.</p>\n<p>There is, to be sure, a commonplace assumption behind propensity evidence: <i>If she did it before, she's more likely to have done it again. Cf., e.g., </i><i>Old Chief v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118074\"><a href=\"/opinion/118074/old-chief-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">519</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">172</span></a></span>, 181, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118074\"><a href=\"/opinion/118074/old-chief-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">574</span></a></span> (1997); Fed.R.Evid. 404(b). And there is a peculiar aspect to propensity evidence in rape cases, in which evidence of the <i>victim's</i> sexual predilections e.g., a propensity for sexual willingness has historically been considered indicative of whether the victim consented to the incident in question. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Evid. 412. And this is an assumption that the Michigan legislature (like many others across the country) was attempting to overcome by enacting its rape shield statute.</p>\n<p>The Michigan legislature has declared such evidence generally inadmissible as a matter of public policy: that rape victims should be encouraged to report and prosecute rapes without fear that private, potentially embarrassing, incidents from their past will become the centerpiece of the ensuing trial. The majority disagrees and holds that the rape-shield statute is no bar to evidence of a rape victim's promiscuity or prior willingness to engage in sexual debauchery, if that evidence is \"highly relevant, noncumulative, and indispensable to the central dispute in a criminal trial.\"</p>\n<p>But, as the Seventh Circuit stated so cogently, \"by that logic rape shield laws would be unconstitutional to the core,\" <i>see </i><i>Sandoval,</i> 996 F.2d at 151, inasmuch as the very purpose of a rape-shield statute is to exclude, on policy grounds, evidence that is almost always highly relevant, non-cumulative, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*301</span> and indispensable to the central dispute in a criminal trial. If the majority wants to hold that rape-shield statutes are unconstitutional, it should do so forthrightly. At least, that way, we would have the issue front and center, with an opportunity for debate and dissent.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B.</h2>\n<p>I cannot agree that the Michigan Court of Appeals unreasonably applied any clearly established law, and I cannot join the majority opinion which, in effect, invalidates all rape shield laws as violative of the Sixth Amendment. Therefore, I respectfully dissent. I would reverse the district court's judgment and deny the petitioner's request for habeas relief.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  That statute provides as follows:\n</p>\n<p>Sec. 520b. (1) A person is guilty of criminal sexual conduct in the first degree if he or she engages in sexual penetration with another person and ...</p>\n<p>(f) The actor causes personal injury to the victim and force or coercion is used to accomplish sexual penetration.</p>\n<p>Mich.
