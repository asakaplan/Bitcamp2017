Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 2 Cir., 82 F.2d 249, to the effect that the fact that in previous years the Commissioner has accepted returns upon a basis other than that of the change he requires will not preclude him from insisting upon a method that will clearly reflect the income for the period being audited: The decision of the Tax Court is affirmed for the reasons stated in its opinion and upon the basis of its findings of fact, supported by the evidence.</p>\n</div>",
