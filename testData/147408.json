Defendant-Appellant Raymond Yono appeals his\nconviction and sentence, arguing that his right against self-incrimination was violated\nwhen the district court failed to ensure affirmatively that he knowingly and voluntarily\nchose to testify on his own behalf. We AFFIRM.\n\n\n        *\n        The Honorable R. Leon Jordan, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of\nTennessee, sitting by designation.\n\n\n                                              1\n\fNo. 09-1548         United States v. Yono                                            Page 2\n\n\n                                  I. BACKGROUND\n\n        Following a jury trial, Yono was convicted of four counts of bank fraud and\naiding and abetting, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1344 and 2; and one count of altering\nan obligation to the United States and aiding and abetting, in violation of 18 U.S.C.\n§§ 471 and 2. The district court sentenced him to a prison term of twenty-four months.\nWhile Yono professed his innocence at trial, multiple witnesses testified to his\ninvolvement in a scheme that involved depositing altered Social Security checks and\nother forged checks in various banks accounts and accessing the funds.\n\n        Yono testified on his own behalf at trial, claiming that he had been the victim of\nidentity theft. His testimony, however, failed to explain much of the evidence against\nhim. And, as he notes on appeal, not only was he a “poor witness,” he also “exhibited\nsigns of paranoia, confusion and memory deficits.” (Br. for Defendant-Appellant\nYono 9.)\n\n                                     II. ANALYSIS\n\n        Yono now contends that his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination\nwas violated as a result of his testimony because the district court failed to develop a\nrecord indicating that his decision to testify was made knowingly and voluntarily.\nYono’s claim fails because he had no right to such a district court record.\n\n        While the Sixth Circuit has not expressly addressed the issue, other courts have\nfound that a defendant has no right to have the district court develop a record to establish\nthat he has voluntarily waived his right not to testify. See Brown v. Artuz, 124 F.3d 73,\n79 (2d Cir. 1997) (“[T]he trial judge need not stop a defendant called by defense counsel\nto the stand and explain the right not to testify. . . .”). In fact, courts have recognized\nthat it is inadvisable for a district court to develop such a record because it may infringe\non the defendant’s right to testify. E.g., United States v. Pennycooke, 65 F.3d 9, 11 (3d\nCir. 1995) (“The fact that a criminal defendant, depending on the facts and\ncircumstances of the case, reasonably could choose either to testify or not to testify,\nnecessarily means the determination of whether the defendant will testify is an important\n\fNo. 09-1548         United States v. Yono                                              Page 3\n\n\npart of trial strategy best left to the defendant and counsel without the intrusion of the\ntrial court, as that intrusion may have the unintended effect of swaying the defendant one\nway or the other.”).\n\n        We previously addressed a similar situation and came to the same conclusion.\nThis Court has ruled that a district court colloquy is not required to assess the\nvoluntariness of a defendant’s waiver of the right to testify, the corollary to the right not\nto testify. United States v. Webber, 208 F.3d 545, 551 (6th Cir. 2000) (“Barring any\nstatements or actions from the defendant indicating disagreement with counsel or the\ndesire to testify, the trial court is neither required to sua sponte address a silent defendant\nand inquire whether the defendant knowingly and intentionally waived the right to\ntestify, nor ensure that the defendant has waived the right on the record.”). Such a\ncolloquy, this Court recognized, might impede on a defendant’s right not to testify. Id.\nat 552 (“[A] sua sponte inquiry from the trial judge regarding the defendant’s choice to\ntestify might impede on an appropriate defense strategy, might lead the defendant to\nbelieve that defense counsel has been insufficient, or might inappropriately influence the\ndefendant to waive the Fifth Amendment right not to testify.”). Our precedent therefore\nconfirms the reasoning outlined above that a colloquy into the defendant’s waiver of his\nright not to testify might impede the defendant’s right to testify and, therefore, not only\nis not required, but is inadvisable. Id. (“[T]he right not to testify counterpoises the right\nto testify, and the exercise of one is the waiver of the other. . . .” (internal quotation\nmarks omitted)).\n\n        Finally, even if Yono did have a right to such a record, he has not presented\nsufficient evidence to suggest that his decision to testify was made unknowingly or\ninvoluntarily.\n\n                                   III. CONCLUSION\n\n        For these reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.\n\f",
