Upon reconsideration, however, it appears to us that, with respect to the defendant below, it having obtained the information as to the secret processes now covered by patents, through breach of confidence, it is not in position to question their validity, and that both upon authority and general equitable principles the plaintiff ought not to have the burden of suing for patent infringement when its proprietary rights in the processes have already been adjudicated as against the defendant.</p>\n<p>It is therefore ordered that the final paragraph of the opinion be withdrawn and that the following paragraph be substituted:</p>\n<p>The decree in No. 6330 holding the patent claims in suit invalid is affirmed. The decree in No. 6331 awarding an accounting and damages for appropriation of the plaintiff's secret processes and granting injunction against their infringement is modified by extending the injunction to all processes here involved, whether or not they are the subjects of granted patents, and, when so modified, is affirmed.
