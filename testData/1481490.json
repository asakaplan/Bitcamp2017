St. § 10138¼ et seq.), came upon a 40-acre farm of plaintiff in error. In his quest he came upon a shack or a cabin, located in a wooded swamp and not visible from outside the woods. He walked around in front, and looking through an open door saw a still and its appurtenances in operation within the shack.

At the trial, the government agent testified to the above facts, among others, but prior to his testimony plaintiff in error filed a motion to suppress that evidence, for the reason that the cabin or shack was a part of the home curtilage, and that the evidence would be incompetent under the search and seizure restrictions of the United States Constitution.
