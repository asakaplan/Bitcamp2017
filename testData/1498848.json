Mason, of Detroit, Mich., for appellee.</p>\n<p>Before HICKS, SIMONS, and ALLEN, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>PER CURIAM.</p>\n<p>It appearing that the appellee had obtained a judgment in the District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan in the sum of $25,000, on a surety bond; that upon appeal to this court by the present appellant the judgment was affirmed in an opinion filed June 7, 1939, wherein it was indicated that the appellant might protect itself against claimants by paying the amount of the judgment into the registry of the court, 6 Cir., 104 F.2d 413; and</p>\n<p>It further appearing that our mandate in pursuance of affirmance was filed in the District Court on June 11, 1939, and that in conformity therewith the appellant paid into the registry of the court the amount of the judgment, together with interest thereon from the date of its rendition; and</p>\n<p>It further appearing that subsequently, on August 15, 1939, the District Judge entered an order correcting and amending the judgment by us affirmed, by adding thereto the words \"with interest thereon at 5% from July 14, 1935, the date of the institution of the suit, to February 11, 1937, the date of the judgment\".</p>\n<p>Now, therefore, it is the view of this court that the District Judge was without power to alter a judgment affirmed by us and that it was his duty, upon the receipt of the mandate, to proceed with the execution of the judgment, and no more; that this limitation upon the authority of the District Judge to alter the judgment in defiance of the express command of the mandate, is established by a long line of federal cases, including In re Washington &amp; G. R. Co., 140 U.S. 91, 11 S.Ct. 673, 35 L.Ed. 339; Kansas City S. R. Co. v. Guardian Trust Co., 281 U.S. 1, 50 S.Ct. 194, 74 L.Ed. 659; Harrison v.
