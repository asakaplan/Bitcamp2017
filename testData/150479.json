WISEMAN, D. J. (p. 44), delivered a separate opinion concurring in part and\ndissenting in part.\n                                     _________________\n\n                                           OPINION\n                                     _________________\n\n        SUTTON, Circuit Judge. Imagine if a State imposed these restrictions on\ncandidates for election to the legislature: (1) They “shall not identify” themselves “as\na member of a political party in any form of advertising or when speaking to a\ngathering”; (2) they “shall not solicit campaign funds”; and (3) they “shall not . . . make\na statement that a reasonable person would perceive as committing” the candidate to vote\n“a certain way on a[n] . . . issue” likely to come before the legislature. A court faced\nwith a First (and Fourteenth) Amendment challenge to the law would make short work\nof it. Legislative candidates have a First Amendment right to associate publicly with a\npolitical party, see Tashjian v. Republican Party of Conn., 479 U.S. 208, 214 (1986), to\nsolicit campaign funds, see Riley v. Nat’l Fed. of the Blind of N.C., 487 U.S. 781, 796\n(1988), and to communicate to their constituents how they will vote on the issues of the\n\n\n        *\n           The Honorable Thomas A. Wiseman, Jr., Senior United States District Judge for the Middle\nDistrict of Tennessee, sitting by designation.\n\fNos. 08-6468/6538           Carey v. Wolnitzek, et al.                                Page 3\n\n\nday, see Brown v. Hartlage, 456 U.S. 45, 55–59 (1982). It is doubtful that a single\nfederal or state court judge in the country would see it differently.\n\n        Yet what happens if the same restrictions apply to judicial elections, not\nlegislative elections? Some say the answer is the same. Elections are elections, and the\nsame First Amendment applies to all of them. When the government suppresses election\nspeech based on its content—prohibiting candidates from mentioning a political party\nwith whom they affiliate, barring them from putting their name on a fund-raising letter\nor telling them what they can and cannot say about their judicial philosophy—the most\nrigorous form of constitutional second-guessing applies, and no categorical exemption\nfrom the First Amendment spares the government from this burden. In modern America,\njudicial elections are no less relevant to the public policy concerns of the citizenry than\nlegislative elections, and the First Amendment protects electioneering speech in the one\ncontext as vigorously as it does in the other. Concerns about impartiality and open-\nmindedness that might result from unfettered judicial campaigning can be handled after\nthe elections, not before, through the application of case-by-case judicial recusal rules\nthat all States require their judges to follow before they agree to hear a case. Any\nremaining concerns flow not from the absence of speech restrictions on judicial\ncandidates but from the State’s insistence on holding elections for judicial office in the\nfirst place. A State cannot simultaneously insist that judges be held accountable to the\nelectorate at regular intervals but deny to sitting judges and candidates alike the\ncommunicative tools for explaining how they will be held to account.\n\n        Others say it is not that easy. Judges do not represent constituents. They apply\nthe law to the facts one case at a time, and, if they represent anyone or anything, it is the\nrule of law, which is why they sometimes must rule against the policy preferences of a\nmajority of the voters. The judicial process works only when it is done in a disinterested\nmanner, which is inconsistent with campaigns in which judges commit to rule, or appear\nto commit to rule, in a certain way in certain cases. It is one thing when a legislator\nsolicits money during a campaign; it is quite another when a judicial candidate, a sitting\njudge above all, does the same. With a few modest exceptions, see, e.g., Caperton v. A.\n\fNos. 08-6468/6538          Carey v. Wolnitzek, et al.                              Page 4\n\n\nT. Massey Coal Co., ___ U.S. ___, 129 S. Ct. 2252 (2009); Mich. Court Rule 2.003,\njudicial-recusal rules are self-enforced and therefore may not provide adequate\nsafeguards against the risks that flow from treating judicial elections like legislative\nones. Unlike the other branches of government, the authority of the judiciary turns\nalmost exclusively on its credibility and the respect warranted by its rulings, both of\nwhich are likely to be diminished by free-flowing electoral speech that permits the\nmalignant inference that there is such a thing as caucus-bound blue-robed judges and\ncaucus-bound red-robed judges. In some settings, there can be too much of a good thing,\nand unfettered free speech in judicial elections is one of them.\n\n       This is a complicated debate, and today’s case requires us to take a side on some\nof these issues. Most recently in 2005, the Kentucky Supreme Court promulgated a\njudicial canon along the lines of the hypothetical legislative campaign rules mentioned\nabove. As sitting judges ourselves, we have considerable sympathy for the concerns that\nprompted the canon, so much so that we embrace a central premise of it: Judicial\nelections differ from legislative elections, and the Kentucky Supreme Court has a\ncompelling interest in regulating judicial campaign speech to ensure the reality and\nappearance of an impartial judiciary. Yet because two clauses of the canon overlooked\nnarrower ways of advancing this interest and because, as written, they remain\nincompatible with the United States Supreme Court’s decision in Republican Party of\nMinnesota v. White, 536 U.S. 765 (2002), we must invalidate them. The third clause is\nconstitutional in the main but contains a material ambiguity, which requires further\nconsideration by the district court. The district court’s decision is affirmed in part and\nvacated in part.\n\n                                            I.\n\n                                           A.\n\n       In 1792, Kentucky became the fifteenth State (and the fourth Commonwealth).\nThe original Kentucky Constitution permitted the Governor to appoint judges, see Ky.\nConst. art. 2, § 8 (1792), but the Commonwealth, in the aftermath of the Age of Jackson,\n\fNos. 08-6468/6538           Carey v. Wolnitzek, et al.                                  Page 5\n\n\namended its Constitution in 1850 to require its judges to stand for popular election to\neight-year terms. See Ky. Const. § 117; Ky. Const. art. 4, §§ 4, 6 (1850). Since 1975,\njudicial elections in Kentucky have been “nonpartisan,” compare Ky. Const. §116\n(1891) with Ky. Const. §117 (1976), meaning that political parties have no formal role\nin any stage of the judicial selection process. Prospective candidates submit petitions\nfor nomination to the Secretary of State. Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 118A.060. The\nCommonwealth holds a single primary election for each judicial seat with no party\nidentifiers and random ballot positioning. Id. The top two vote-getters in the primary\nelection receive a spot on the general election ballot, which also is held without any\nparty identifier. Id.\n\n        In competing for judicial seats, all candidates must abide by the Kentucky Code\nof Judicial Conduct. Promulgated by the Kentucky Supreme Court, it generally prohibits\n“a judge or judicial candidate” from “inappropriate political activity.” Rules of Supreme\nCourt of Kentucky 3.130(8.2); 4.300, Canon 5. Sitting judges or judicial candidates\nviolate this admonition, the Code says, if they fail to follow these clauses of Canon 5,\namong others:\n\n        The party affiliation clause. “A judge or candidate shall not identify\n        himself or herself as a member of a political party in any form of\n        advertising, or when speaking to a gathering. If not initiated by the judge\n        or candidate for such office, and only in answer to a direct question, the\n        judge or candidate may identify himself or herself as a member of a\n        particular political party.” Canon 5A(2).\n        The solicitation clause. “A judge or a candidate for judicial office shall\n        not solicit campaign funds, but may establish committees of responsible\n        persons to secure and manage the expenditure of funds for the campaign\n        and to obtain public statements of support for the candidacy.” Canon\n        5B(2).\n        The commits clause. “A judge or candidate for election to judicial office\n        . . . shall not intentionally or recklessly make a statement that a\n        reasonable person would perceive as committing the judge or candidate\n        to rule a certain way in a case, controversy, or issue that is likely to come\n        before the court . . . .” Canon 5B(1)(c).\n\fNos. 08-6468/6538          Carey v. Wolnitzek, et al.                               Page 6\n\n\nThe Kentucky Judicial Conduct Commission, a constitutionally mandated state body\nsubject to judicial review by the Kentucky Supreme Court, see Ky. Const. § 121,\nenforces the Code of Judicial Conduct. It may impose sanctions on violators of the\nCode, which run the gamut from a private reprimand to a public censure to removal from\noffice to a referral to the Kentucky Bar Association for disbarment from the practice of\nlaw. Rules of Supreme Court of Kentucky 4.020. The Kentucky Inquiry Commission\nand the Office of Bar Counsel also police ethical violations by Kentucky attorneys,\nincluding violations of the rule that “[a] lawyer who is a candidate for judicial office\nshall comply with the applicable provisions of the Code of Judicial Conduct.” Rules of\nSupreme Court of Kentucky 3.130(8.2); 3.160(1).\n\n                                            B.\n\n       In June 2006, Marcus Carey, then a candidate for a seat on the Kentucky\nSupreme Court, filed a complaint in federal district court claiming that the party\naffiliation, solicitation and commits clauses violated his speech and associational rights\nunder the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution. The named\ndefendants sit on the Kentucky Judicial Conduct Commission, sit on the Kentucky\nInquiry Commission or serve as Bar Counsel.\n\n       Carey complained that he wanted to disclose his party status, yet he feared the\nparty affiliation clause barred him from doing so. He wanted to ask for campaign\ncontributions by signing fund-raising letters, yet he feared the solicitation clause barred\nhim from doing so. And he wished to respond to a judicial questionnaire distributed by\nKentucky Right to Life, raising questions for the candidates about their judicial\nphilosophy and about their positions on specific issues, yet he feared the commits clause\nbarred him from doing so. He asked the court to declare the clauses unconstitutional on\ntheir face and to enjoin their enforcement.\n\n       In October 2006, roughly one month before the election, the district court\npreliminarily enjoined enforcement of the party affiliation and the solicitation clauses\nbut dismissed Carey’s challenge to the commits clause on ripeness and standing grounds.\nOn November 2, Carey moved to amend his complaint, re-challenging the commits\n\fNos. 08-6468/6538          Carey v. Wolnitzek, et al.                               Page 7\n\n\nclause, this time detailing the statements he proposed to make in possible violation of\nthe clause. About a week later, Carey lost the election.\n\n       In September 2007, the court ruled that Carey’s amended challenge to the\ncommits clause was ripe for review and allowed it to proceed along with Carey’s\nchallenges to the party affiliation and solicitation clauses. The parties all moved for\nsummary judgment. In ruling on the motions, the district court determined that strict\nscrutiny applied to all of the challenges. It then invalidated the party affiliation and\nsolicitation clauses on their face but rejected Carey’s facial challenge to the commits\nclause. The state defendants appeal the court’s ruling on the party affiliation and\nsolicitation clauses, and Carey appeals the court’s ruling on the commits clause.\n\n                                            II.\n\n       Before turning to the merits, we must consider two jurisdictional questions\nimplicated by these challenges: Did Carey file his claims too early, making them unripe\nfor judicial review, or too late, making them moot? See Warshak v. United States, 532\nF.3d 521, 525 (6th Cir. 2008) (en banc).\n\n       Ripeness. Designed to ensure that the federal courts resolve “existing, substantial\ncontroversies,” Norton v. Ashcroft, 298 F.3d 547, 554 (6th Cir. 2002), not disputes\n“anchored in future events that may not occur as anticipated” or may not occur “at all,”\nNat’l Rifle Ass’n of Am. v. Magaw, 132 F.3d 272, 284 (6th Cir. 1997), the ripeness\ndoctrine ensures that a dispute is concrete and real before the judicial branch resolves\nit. Three considerations inform the doctrine: Is the alleged injury likely to occur? Is the\nfactual record sufficiently developed to resolve the question? And what kinds of\nhardships, if any, will the parties face if the court delays resolution of the question?\nWarshak, 532 F.3d at 525. In the context of a free-speech overbreadth challenge like\nthis one, a relaxed ripeness standard applies to steer clear of the risk that the law “may\ncause others not before the court to refrain from constitutionally protected speech or\nexpression.” Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U.S. 601, 612 (1973).\n\fNos. 08-6468/6538           Carey v. Wolnitzek, et al.                                Page 8\n\n\n        Carey meets these requirements. In future judicial elections, as in prior ones, he\nclaims an interest in engaging in protected speech that implicates, if not violates, each\nclause. He wants to let voters know his party affiliation. He wants to solicit campaign\nfunds directly, as opposed to indirectly via an election committee. And he wants to\nanswer judicial questionnaires propounded by a local right-to-life organization. These\naspects of the canon at least chill, and in some instances prohibit, these forms of\ncommunication, and in the course of the November 2006 election, at least until the entry\nof the October 2006 injunction, Carey censored himself on each topic. All of this\nestablishes a “credible fear of enforcement,” Norton, 298 F.3d at 554, sufficient to\novercome any ripeness concerns.\n\n        The Kentucky Judicial Conduct Commission persists that the Kentucky Supreme\nCourt and its ethics branch, the Kentucky Judicial Ethics Committee, have yet to apply\nthese clauses to Carey, noting that “an authoritative construction of the canons may\nsignificantly alter the constitutional questions.” Commission’s Opening Br. at 22. That\nis all true, but it is a peculiar ground for staying our hand now with respect to all of these\nchallenges, some of which involve clauses with little ambiguity. See City of Lakewood\nv. Plain Dealer Pub. Co., 486 U.S. 750, 770 n.11 (1988). This challenge dates from July\n2006, and a related challenge, supported by the same counsel, dates from September\n2004, see Family Trust Found. of Ky., Inc. v. Wolnitzek, 345 F. Supp. 2d 672 (E.D. Ky.\n2004). The Commission has had ample time to request interpretations or modifications\nof Canon 5 by the Committee or the Court, yet apparently has not done so. Nor has the\nCommission, or anyone else in this case, asked the federal courts to certify any questions\nto the Kentucky Supreme Court. These claims are ripe for review.\n\n        Mootness. In one sense, Carey’s original challenge seems moot because the\nNovember 2006 election has come and gone. Carey filed his original complaint months\nahead of the election, and moved to amend it a week before the election, yet here we are\nmore than three years after the election, still considering his claims. Carey, however,\nretains the right to run for judicial office again, and all candidates for judicial office in\nKentucky, whether sitting judges or not, are subject to Canon 5.                Under these\n\fNos. 08-6468/6538          Carey v. Wolnitzek, et al.                                Page 9\n\n\ncircumstances, the claims may proceed: The alleged wrongs are “capable of repetition,\nyet evading review,” saving them from mootness, as the district court correctly held and\nas the parties do not dispute. See Fed. Election Comm’n v. Wis. Right to Life, Inc., 551\nU.S. 449, 462 (2007); Briggs v. Ohio Elections Comm’n, 61 F.3d 487, 492–93 (6th Cir.\n1995).\n\n                                            III.\n\n                                            A.\n\n         Two recent decisions of the Supreme Court—White and Caperton—set the stage\nfor resolving the merits of this dispute. At issue in White was a judicial canon, first\npromulgated by Minnesota in 1974, providing that “a candidate for a judicial office,\nincluding an incumbent judge,” shall not “announce his or her views on disputed legal\nor political issues.” Minn. Code of Judicial Conduct, Canon 5(A)(3)(d)(i); White, 536\nU.S. at 768. Applying strict scrutiny, the Court rejected Minnesota’s contention that the\ncanon preserved judicial “impartiality” in a permissible way.\n\n         To the extent the Minnesota announce clause sought to preserve judicial\n“impartiality” in one sense—a “lack of bias for or against either party to the\nproceeding,” id. at 775—the Court accepted the State’s interest as a compelling one. Id.\nat 777 n.7. But the clause suffered from a means-end problem because it did “not restrict\nspeech for or against particular parties, but rather speech for or against particular\nissues.” Id. at 776. It may be, the Court acknowledged, that, “when a case arises that\nturns on a legal issue on which the judge (as a candidate) had taken a particular stand,\nthe party taking the opposite stand is likely to lose,” but that is not due to “any bias\nagainst that party” for “[a]ny party taking that position is just as likely to lose.” Id. at\n776–77.\n\n         To the extent the State meant to advance “impartiality” in another sense—an\nabsence of judicial “preconception in favor of or against a particular legal view”—that\nwas not a compelling interest. Id. at 777. “[S]ince avoiding judicial preconceptions on\nlegal issues is neither possible nor desirable, pretending otherwise by attempting to\n\fNos. 08-6468/6538            Carey v. Wolnitzek, et al.                           Page 10\n\n\npreserve the ‘appearance’ of that type of impartiality can hardly be a compelling state\ninterest either.” Id. at 778.\n\n        And to the extent the State meant to promote “impartiality” in the sense of\njudicial “open-mindedness”—the “willing[ness] to consider views that oppose [one’s]\npreconceptions”—the Court found it unnecessary to decide whether this “desirable”\nquality amounted to a compelling interest. Id. at 778. It held that the clause was so\npoorly tailored to any interest in open-mindedness that the Minnesota Supreme Court\ncould not have “adopted the announce clause for that purpose.” Id. Judges, both\nincumbent and prospective, it reasoned, retained so many ways to communicate their\nviews on legal issues other than through election statements that the clause gratuitously\nlimited speech while “leav[ing] appreciable damage to that supposedly vital interest\nunprohibited.” Id. at 780.\n\n        Caperton dealt with a sitting state supreme court justice whose top campaign\ndonor in the previous election, the head of a mining company, had spent $3 million on\nhis behalf—more than all of his other supporters combined. See Caperton, 129 S. Ct.\nat 2257. When a high-stakes dispute involving the mining company came before the\ncourt, the justice refused to recuse himself from hearing it and ultimately joined the 3–2\nmajority in ruling for the company. See id. at 2258. The losing party claimed that the\njustice’s participation in the case violated its due process rights. The Supreme Court\nagreed, holding that, by refusing to disqualify himself, the justice had unconstitutionally\ndeprived the parties of a fair hearing. See id. at 2265. When “there is a serious risk of\nactual bias,” the Court reasoned, the Constitution requires judges to disqualify\nthemselves, though the Court cautioned that this was “an extraordinary situation,”\nemphasizing the size of the mining company’s support relative to other donors’ support,\nthe apparently decisive effect of this support on the justice’s election and the close\ntemporal connection between the justice’s election and the company’s case. Id. at 2263,\n2265.\n\fNos. 08-6468/6538           Carey v. Wolnitzek, et al.                               Page 11\n\n\n                                             B.\n\n        Strict scrutiny applies to all three aspects of this First Amendment challenge.\nWhite, for one, suggests as much, even if the decision does not compel that conclusion.\nIn striking down Minnesota’s announce clause, the Court said the following about the\nstandard of review:\n\n        As the Court of Appeals recognized, the announce clause both prohibits\n        speech on the basis of its content and burdens a category of speech that\n        is “at the core of our First Amendment freedoms”—speech about the\n        qualifications of candidates for public office. 247 F.3d at 861, 863. The\n        Court of Appeals concluded that the proper test to be applied to\n        determine the constitutionality of such a restriction is what our cases\n        have called strict scrutiny, id., at 864; the parties do not dispute that this\n        is correct.\n\n536 U.S. at 774.\n\n        The state defendants seize on the modest length of the Court’s analysis and\nMinnesota’s concession, arguing that we need not apply strict scrutiny here. But White’s\nbrevity on this score and Minnesota’s concession may suggest something else: that the\ncounter-argument has little to support it. The multi-State amicus brief filed in support\nof Minnesota did not question the applicability of strict scrutiny in White. See Brief\nAmicus Curiae of California, et al. in Support of Respondents, Republican Party of\nMinn. v. Kelly, 536 U.S. 765 (2002) (No. 01-521). Not one of the Justices, not even one\nof the four dissenters, objected to the application of strict scrutiny. And if strict scrutiny\ndoes not apply to judicial canons like this one and the one at issue in White, it is difficult\nto understand why the Court exercised its discretion in reviewing White, given that\nvirtually the entire analysis is premised on the applicability of strict scrutiny and given\nthat the outcome of the case under a lower level of scrutiny is far from clear.\n\n        Free-speech first principles also suggest that strict scrutiny should apply. The\nthree canons censor speech based on its content in the most basic of ways: They prevent\ncandidates from speaking about some subjects (judicial philosophy, the legal issues of\nthe day, party affiliation) but not others (experience); and they prevent candidates from\n\fNos. 08-6468/6538          Carey v. Wolnitzek, et al.                            Page 12\n\n\nasking for support in some ways (campaign funds) but not others (a vote, yard signs).\nThe canons refer directly to, and are “justified with[] reference to,” the content of\ncandidates’ speech, meaning they are not eligible for the relaxed review that content-\nneutral restrictions receive. Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U.S. 781, 791 (1989).\n\n       Content-based restrictions on speech generally face strict scrutiny, see United\nStates v. Playboy Entm’t Group, Inc., 529 U.S. 803, 813 (2000), and thus are\n“presumptively invalid” unless the restriction discriminates on the basis of categorically\n“proscribable” speech, see R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul, 505 U.S. 377, 382–83 (1992). See\nalso United States v. Stevens, No. 08-769, slip. op. at 5 (April 20, 2010). None of the\ncategorical carve-outs apply. The canons do not address “fighting words” or incitement,\nsee Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 315 U.S. 568, 572 (1942), defamation, see\nBeauharnais v. Illinois, 343 U.S. 250 (1952), obscenity, see Roth v. United States, 354\nU.S. 476 (1957), or child pornography, see New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747, 764\n(1982). Far from implicating these exceptions, today’s regulations implicate a core area\nof free-speech protection: elections. See Brown, 456 U.S. at 53–54; see also Stevens,\nslip op. at 9 (declining to declare “depictions of animal cruelty” as a “new categor[y] of\nspeech outside the scope of the First Amendment”).\n\n       Nor does the nature of the restrictions implicate any of the other areas or types\nof regulation—time, place and manner restrictions, commercial speech, expressive\nconduct—in which the Court has applied less-than-rigorous review. The canons instead\nare of a piece with the kinds of speech regulation—telling candidates what they can and\ncannot say before an election—that the courts have scrutinized most rigorously. See,\ne.g., Brown, 456 U.S. at 53–54; see also Erwin Chemerinsky, Restrictions on the Speech\nof Judicial Candidates are Unconstitutional, 35 Ind. L. Rev. 735, 740–742 (2002)\n(explaining that strict scrutiny should apply to First Amendment challenges to judicial\ncanons like these); Mark Spottswood, Comment, Free Speech and Due Process\nProblems in the Regulation and Financing of Judicial Election Campaigns, 101 Nw. U.\nL. Rev. 331, 347 (2007) (same).\n\fNos. 08-6468/6538           Carey v. Wolnitzek, et al.                               Page 13\n\n\n        The Commission does not cite a single case, and we have not found one on our\nown, applying anything less than strict scrutiny to comparable free-speech challenges\nto judicial election canons. After White, the Eighth Circuit applied strict scrutiny to\nMinnesota’s party affiliation and solicitation clauses. See Republican Party of Minn. v.\nWhite, 416 F.3d 738, 749 (8th Cir. 2005) (en banc) (“White II”). After White, the\nEleventh Circuit did the same in invalidating Georgia’s rules prohibiting judicial\ncandidates from soliciting campaign funds. See Weaver v. Bonner, 309 F.3d 1312, 1319\n(11th Cir. 2002). After White, the Seventh Circuit applied strict scrutiny to Wisconsin’s\nparty affiliation clause and held that Wisconsin’s solicitation clause survived both\nintermediate and strict scrutiny. See Siefert v. Alexander, ___ F.3d ___, No. 09-1713,\nslip op. at 5, 12 (7th Cir. June 14, 2010). And, before White, the Third Circuit applied\nstrict scrutiny in upholding some judicial speech restrictions.             See Stretton v.\nDisciplinary Bd. of Supreme Court of Pa., 944 F.2d 137, 141–42 (3d Cir. 1991).\n\n        The Commission urges us to apply a form of intermediate scrutiny, which\nbalances the “competing fundamental rights” of some judicial candidates (who have a\nright to engage in campaign speech) and some litigants (who have a right to an impartial\njudiciary). Commission’s Opening Br. at 10. But the reality that judicial impartiality\nis a “vital state interest,” protected by the Due Process Clause, Caperton, 129 S. Ct. at\n2266–67, does not require us to dilute the First Amendment. It establishes instead that\nKentucky has a compelling interest in preserving the canon, proving that the State can\nsatisfy the first requirement of strict scrutiny, not that, having satisfied this requirement,\nit may water down the remaining requirements.\n\n        The Commission’s analogy to Gentile v. State Bar of Nevada, 501 U.S. 1030\n(1991), does not hold up. Gentile “balance[d]” litigants’ fair trial rights with attorneys’\nfree speech rights in upholding a rule prohibiting attorneys involved in a pending trial\nfrom making statements likely to prejudice the proceedings. Id. at 1075. As these\nfeatures of the decision suggest, Gentile applies only to speech restrictions imposed on\nattorneys during a pending case, see id. at 1073 n.5, which is one reason—there are\nothers—why a comparable law restricting judges from telling the press about the\n\fNos. 08-6468/6538           Carey v. Wolnitzek, et al.                              Page 14\n\n\noutcome of a pending case would not be an unconstitutional prior restraint on speech.\nToday, however, we have a speech restriction aimed not at judges performing court\nfunctions but at judges and judicial candidates making campaign statements or\nsolicitations outside of court and outside of the process of deciding cases in their official\ncapacity—all for the purpose of communicating information to voters about whom they\nshould elect. That Gentile upholds a law restricting a lawyer’s speech during a trial does\nnot mean that it allows restrictions on lawyers in all settings. Otherwise, a lawyer\nrunning to be the Attorney General or Governor of a State could be censored simply\nbecause she is an “officer of the court.” That is not the case.\n\n        The Commission insists that the solicitation clause is an especially poor\ncandidate for strict scrutiny review, because the Supreme Court applies a “lesser”\nstandard of review to restrictions on political donations. See McConnell v. Fed.\nElection Comm’n, 540 U.S. 93, 136 (2003). But this argument gives analogy a bad\nname. The solicitation clause does not set a contribution limit, as in McConnell and\nsimilar cases. See, e.g., Fed. Election Comm’n v. Nat’l Right to Work Comm., 459 U.S.\n197, 208 (1982). It flatly prohibits speech, not donations, based on the topic (solicitation\nof a contribution) and speaker (a judge or judicial candidate)—precisely the kind of\ncontent-based regulations that traditionally warrant strict scrutiny.\n\n                                             C.\n\n        Because strict scrutiny applies, the Commission faces a daunting gauntlet, as “it\nis the rare” law that “survives” this kind of review. Burson v. Freeman, 504 U.S. 191,\n211 (1992). To survive, the three canons must be “narrowly tailored” to advance a\n“compelling state interest.” Eu v. San Francisco County Democratic Cent. Comm., 489\nU.S. 214, 222 (1989).\n\n        At the same time, Carey seeks to invalidate these clauses not just as applied to\nhim but in all of their applications, which is to say on their face. In most constitutional\ncases, that exceptional remedy requires the claimant to “show one of two things: (1) that\nthere truly are ‘no’ or at least few ‘circumstances’ in ‘which the Act would be valid,’\nUnited States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 745 (1987); see also Wash. State Grange v.\n\fNos. 08-6468/6538          Carey v. Wolnitzek, et al.                             Page 15\n\n\nWash. State Republican Party, 552 U.S. 442, 449–50 (2008); or (2) that a court cannot\nsever the unconstitutional textual provisions of the law or enjoin its unconstitutional\napplications.” Connection Distrib. Co. v. Holder, 557 F.3d 321, 335 (6th Cir. 2009) (en\nbanc). The courts, however, “rightly lighten this load in the context of free-speech\nchallenges to the facial validity of a law.” Id. In view of the risk that “enforcement of\nan overbroad law” may “deter[] people from engaging in constitutionally protected\nspeech” and may “inhibit[ ] the free exchange of ideas,” the overbreadth doctrine permits\ncourts to invalidate a law on its face “if ‘a substantial number of its applications are\nunconstitutional, judged in relation to the statute’s plainly legitimate sweep.’” Stevens,\nNo. 08-769, slip op. at 10 (quoting Wash. State Grange, 522 U.S. at 449 n.6).\n\n                                           IV.\n\n                                           A.\n\n       Party affiliation clause. This clause prohibits judges and candidates from\ndisclosing their party affiliation “in any form of advertising, or when speaking to a\ngathering,” save in answer to a question by a voter in one-on-one or “very small private\ninformal” settings. Rules of Supreme Court of Kentucky 4.300, Canon 5(A)(2);\nKentucky Judicial Ethics Opinion JE-105 (2004). The clause advances at least two\ninterests, both sufficiently compelling to satisfy the First Amendment. It furthers the\nCommonwealth’s goal of having a judiciary that is neither biased in fact nor in\nappearance. See White, 536 U.S. at 775–79. And it furthers the Commonwealth’s\ninterest in diminishing reliance on political parties in judicial selection, a policy\ngrounded in the Kentucky Constitution’s requirement that judicial elections be\nnonpartisan in nature.\n\n       The problem, however, is not the Commonwealth’s laudable interests in\npromulgating this canon; it is the Commonwealth’s methods in furthering them. The\nCourt frequently says that censoring speech must be a government’s measure of\n“last—not first—resort” in advancing its policy interests, e.g., Thompson v. W. States\nMed. Ctr., 535 U.S. 357, 373 (2002), and the narrow-tailoring requirement is proof that\n\fNos. 08-6468/6538          Carey v. Wolnitzek, et al.                              Page 16\n\n\nthe Court means it. If a law does too much, or does too little, to advance the\ngovernment’s objectives, it will fail. See Eu, 489 U.S. at 222. This canon does both.\n\n        The canon’s first problem is a White problem—that it suppresses too much\nspeech to advance the government’s interest. In invalidating Minnesota’s announce\nclause, White established that a State may not prohibit a judicial candidate from\ndisclosing, say, that “I am for limited government,” “I support a woman’s right to\nchoose,” “I prefer tough-on-crime laws,” or, to use an example from White, “I think it\nis constitutional for the legislature to prohibit same-sex marriage.” 536 U.S. at 779. The\nparty affiliation clause prohibits all of this, only more so. It prohibits candidates from\nannouncing their position on one issue of potential importance to voters: the party they\nsupport. And it prohibits them from announcing their position on many issues of\npotential importance to voters: the party platform with which they affiliate. A party\nplatform after all is nothing more than an aggregation of political and legal positions, a\nshorthand way of announcing one’s views on many topics of the day. If the single-issue\nannounce canon at play in White prevented candidates from “communicating relevant\ninformation to voters” on “matters of current public importance,” and did not narrowly\nadvance the State’s interest in a non-partisan judiciary, id. at 781–82, the same is true\nof Kentucky’s canon, which potentially prevents candidates from announcing their views\non many issues at once. See id. at 782 (“We have never allowed the government to\nprohibit candidates from communicating relevant information to voters during an\nelection.”).\n\n        At the same time, the canon does too little to advance the State’s interest in\nimpartiality and the avoidance of partisan influence. Party affiliation, as it turns out, is\nnot a forbidden topic. It is forbidden only when the candidate raises the point. If, by\ncontrast, a voter asks the question in a one-on-one setting or in a small gathering, the\ncandidate is free to say what she wants. That reality undermines the suggestion that a\ncandidate deals a fatal blow to judicial impartiality by revealing her party affiliations.\nAnd of course, once that information is disclosed, whether in answer to a question or\nbased on prior publicly known affiliations (including holding other elected offices),\n\fNos. 08-6468/6538            Carey v. Wolnitzek, et al.                             Page 17\n\n\nnothing in the canon prohibits others, whether newspapers or political parties or interest\ngroups, from disclosing to the world the candidate’s party affiliation. “A law cannot be\nregarded as protecting an interest of the highest order, and thus as justifying a restriction\nupon truthful speech, when it leaves appreciable damage to that supposedly vital interest\nunprohibited.” Id. at 780.\n\n        The clause undershoots its target in another respect. Although candidates may\nnot reveal their party affiliation, they may discuss their membership in, affiliation with\nor support of any other type of organization, including organizations that take positions\non judges and judicial philosophy. Although the two major political parties take\npositions on a wide array of issues, many interest groups advance a narrower set of\npositions and often do so more vocally, particularly with respect to judges. By\nidentifying themselves with such groups, candidates can communicate more about their\npolitical and judicial convictions than they ever could by carrying a party membership\ncard—and, in the process, may do as much to call judicial open-mindedness into\nquestion as any party affiliation ever would.\n\n        The canon also prohibits only disclosure of a candidate’s party membership, not\nparty membership itself. Yet the appearance of judicial closed-mindedness is part and\nparcel of its reality, not a device designed to disguise reality. If concern over judicial\npartisanship and the influence of political parties on judging truly underlies the clause,\nthe authorization to belong (secretly) to a political party amounts to a gaping omission.\nA party’s undisclosed potential influence on candidates is far worse than its disclosed\ninfluence, as the one allows a full airing of the issue before the voters while the other\nhelps to shield it from public view.\n\n        Kentucky responds that the restriction supports the Kentucky Constitution’s\nrequirement that judicial elections be nonpartisan—that they operate with no partisan\nprimaries and with no partisan identifiers at the ballot booth. See Ky. Const. § 117; Ky.\nRev. Stat. § 118A.060. The point, however, cuts both ways. In one sense, it establishes\nthe bona fides of the Commonwealth’s policy. But in another sense, it undermines the\nCommonwealth’s professed need to suppress speech in the process. Carey does not\n\fNos. 08-6468/6538          Carey v. Wolnitzek, et al.                              Page 18\n\n\nchallenge the validity of prohibiting party identifiers on the ballot or the validity of\nholding non-partisan primaries. He just wishes to communicate about a matter of\npotential interest to the voters and one that is often already a point of public\nknowledge—party affiliation—on his own terms.\n\n        Most States have not made the choice Kentucky did. Fifteen States choose their\nSupreme Court justices in contested, “nonpartisan” elections, and only five, including\nKentucky, prohibit candidates in those elections from revealing their partisan affiliations.\nSee App’x A. (Three more prohibit candidates from claiming to be “a candidate of a\npolitical organization” but do not prohibit revealing membership or affiliation. Id.) And\ntwo of these five canons—this one and Wisconsin’s—have been invalidated. See Siefert,\nslip op. at 16. That a majority of the States with nonpartisan Supreme Court elections\nhave opted not to censor their candidates in this way of course does not establish the\ninvalidity of the clause, but it does call into question the necessity of implementing\nKentucky’s nonpartisan judicial election system in this way and whether it amounts to\nthe “least restrictive means” of protecting the Commonwealth’s interests. Playboy\nEntm’t Group, 529 U.S. at 813.\n\n        The Commission says that the clause restricts as little speech as possible while\npreventing Kentucky’s elections from turning into ultra-partisan affairs. It allows\njudges, the Commission adds, to join political parties, to participate in them and to\ndisclose party affiliation if asked in the proper setting—allowing voters who care about\na candidate’s partisan affiliation to discover it while preventing widespread\nadvertisement of a candidate’s party membership and preventing “judicial races [from]\nturning into partisan political campaigns.” Commission’s Opening Br. at 66. Yet this\nargument looks at the problem through the wrong end of the telescope: It merely\ndemonstrates that the clause does not restrict as much speech as it might, not that the\nclause restricts no more speech than is necessary.\n\n        We do not doubt one of the premises of the canon—that party affiliation may not\nbe a reliable indicator of the qualities that make a good judge. Yet “[i]t is simply not the\nfunction of government to select which issues are worth discussing or debating in the\n\fNos. 08-6468/6538           Carey v. Wolnitzek, et al.                            Page 19\n\n\ncourse of a political campaign,” White, 536 U.S. at 782 (quotation omitted), and it is\ndifficult to see how Kentucky’s speech restriction does not do just that. Informational\nbans premised on the fear that voters cannot handle the disclosure have a long history\nof being legislatively tried and judicially struck, whether in the election setting or\nelsewhere. See, e.g., Brown, 456 U.S. at 60 (“The State’s fear that voters might make\nan ill-advised choice does not provide the State with a compelling justification for\nlimiting speech.”); Va. State Bd. of Pharmacy v. Va. Citizens Consumer Council, Inc.,\n425 U.S. 748, 773 (1976). Voters often resort to a variety of proxies in selecting judges\nand other office holders, some good, some bad. And while political identification may\nbe an unhelpful way to pick judges, it assuredly beats other grounds, such as the all-too-\nfamiliar formula of running candidates with familiar or popular last names. In that\nrespect, this informational ban increases the likelihood that one of the least relevant\ngrounds for judicial selection—the fortuity of one’s surname—is all that the voters will\nhave to go on. As the district court correctly concluded, this clause violates the First\nAmendment on its face.\n\n                                            B.\n\n        Solicitation clause. Kentucky prohibits judicial candidates from “solicit[ing]\ncampaign funds,” a restriction that extends to all fundraising by the candidate, including\nin-person solicitations, group solicitations, telephone calls and letters. Rules of Supreme\nCourt of Kentucky 4.300, Canon 5(B)(2). The clause permits the candidate to establish\na committee that may solicit campaign donations, and it permits the committee to\ndisclose to the candidate the names of people who donated to the campaign and those\nwho declined. See id. Kentucky says that the clause satisfies the First Amendment, but\nwe, like the district court, conclude that it does not.\n\n        As with the party affiliation clause, we do not doubt the bona fides of the\nsolicitation clause: that it serves Kentucky’s compelling interest in an impartial\njudiciary. The same goes for its interest in preserving the appearance and reality of a\nnon-corrupt judiciary, an objective often served by fundraising limitations. See Fed.\nElection Comm’n v. Nat’l Conservative Political Action Comm., 470 U.S. 480, 496–97\n\fNos. 08-6468/6538          Carey v. Wolnitzek, et al.                              Page 20\n\n\n(1985). Litigants have a due process right to a trial before a judge with no “direct,\npersonal, substantial pecuniary interest” in the outcome, Tumey v. Ohio, 273 U.S. 510,\n523 (1927), and the legitimacy of the judiciary rests on delivering on that promise and\nin furthering the public’s trust in the integrity of its judges, see Mistretta v. United\nStates, 488 U.S. 361, 407 (1989). See generally Caperton, 129 S. Ct. 2252.\n\n        Preserving these interests, we also acknowledge, grows more complicated when\na State exercises its sovereign right to select judges through popular elections. Judicial\nelections, like most elections, require money—often a lot of it. Kentucky’s 2006\nSupreme Court election, which featured four contested races and one uncontested race,\nsaw ten candidates raise a total of $2,119,871, of which the candidates spent $772,563\non 2,357 television commercials. Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of Law,\nThe New Politics of Judicial Elections 2006 at 3, 16. “Unless the pool of judicial\ncandidates is limited to those wealthy enough to independently fund their campaigns, a\nlimitation unrelated to judicial skill, the cost of campaigning requires judicial candidates\nto engage in fundraising.” White, 536 U.S. at 789–90 (O’Connor, J., concurring).\nComplicating matters further, the general public often, though not invariably, pays less\nattention to judicial elections than other elections, forcing judicial candidates to focus\ntheir fundraising efforts on the segment of the population most likely to have an interest\nin judicial races: the bar. “This leads to the unseemly situation in which judges preside\nover cases in which the parties are represented by counsel who have contributed in\nvarying amounts to the judicial campaigns.” Stretton, 944 F.2d at 145.\n\n        That the clause advances important government interests, however, does not\nestablish that it does so narrowly. Prohibiting candidates from asking for money\nsuppresses speech in the most conspicuous of ways and, in the process, favors some\ncandidates over others—incumbent judges (who benefit from their current status) over\nnon-judicial candidates, the well-to-do (who may not need to raise any money at all)\nover lower-income candidates, and the well-connected (who have an army of potential\nfundraisers) over outsiders. For these reasons, it is tempting to say that any limitation\non a candidate’s right to ask for a campaign contribution is one limitation too many. But\n\fNos. 08-6468/6538          Carey v. Wolnitzek, et al.                              Page 21\n\n\nthere are at least two areas covered by the clause that test such an interpretation—face-\nto-face solicitations, particularly by sitting judges, and solicitations of individuals with\ncases pending in front of the court. Yet we need not decide the validity of such\nrestrictions today because Kentucky goes well beyond them.\n\n        Besides covering in-person solicitations and those directed at individuals with\npending cases, the canon prohibits a range of other solicitations, including speeches to\nlarge groups and signed mass mailings. Such indirect methods of solicitation present\nlittle or no risk of undue pressure or the appearance of a quid pro quo. No one could\nreasonably believe that a failure to respond to a signed mass mailing asking for\ndonations would result in unfair treatment in future dealings with the judge. Nor would\na speech requesting donations from a large gathering have a “coercive effect” on\nreasonable attendees. Commission’s Opening Br. at 55; compare Ohralik v. Ohio State\nBar Ass’n, 436 U.S. 447, 465–66 (1978) (State may regulate lawyers’ in-person for-\nprofit solicitation of clients because of “intrusive[ness]” of “persuasion under\ncircumstances conducive to uninformed acquiescence”) with In re Primus, 436 U.S. 412,\n435–36 (1978) (regulation of lawyer’s written, not-for-profit solicitation merited\nheightened scrutiny because it did not “afford any significant opportunity for\noverreaching or coercion”) and Shapero v. Ky. Bar Ass’n, 486 U.S. 466, 475 (1988)\n(“Targeted, direct-mail solicitation is distinguishable from the in-person solicitation”\nbecause there is no “badgering advocate breathing down [a potential client’s] neck,”\nasking for “an immediate yes-or-no answer.”).\n\n        At the same time, the clause does too little to protect the Commonwealth’s\ninterests. Although the candidate himself may not solicit donations, his campaign\ncommittee may. And nothing prevents a committee member from soliciting donations\nin person. That leaves a rule preventing a candidate from sending a signed mass mailing\nto every voter in the district but permitting the candidate’s best friend to ask for a\ndonation directly from an attorney who frequently practices before the court. Are not\nthe risks of coercion and undue appearance far less with the first (prohibited) solicitation\nthan the second (permitted) one?\n\fNos. 08-6468/6538          Carey v. Wolnitzek, et al.                            Page 22\n\n\n       Although the clause prevents judicial candidates from saying “please, give me\na donation,” it does not prevent them from saying “thank you” for a donation given. The\nclause bars any solicitation, whether in a large group or small one, whether by letter or\none on one, but it does not bar the candidate from learning how individuals responded\nto the committee’s solicitations. That omission suggests that the only interest at play is\nthe impolitic interpersonal dynamics of a candidate’s request for money, not the more\ncorrosive reality of who gives and how much. If the purported risk addressed by the\nclause is that the judge or candidate will treat donors and non-donors differently, it is\nknowing who contributed and who balked that makes the difference, not who asked for\nthe contribution. If Kentucky fears that judges will allow campaign donations to affect\ntheir rulings, it must believe that “[s]uccessful candidates will feel beholden to the\npeople who helped them get elected regardless of who did the soliciting of support.”\nWeaver, 309 F.3d at 1323.\n\n       Two other circuits have considered the validity of similar canons and have come\nto similar conclusions. In Weaver, the Eleventh Circuit considered a Georgia rule\nproviding that judicial candidates “shall not themselves solicit campaign funds.” 309\nF.3d at 1315. Relying on many of the same means-end problems identified here, the\ncourt concluded that the canon was “not narrowly tailored to serve Georgia’s compelling\ninterest in judicial impartiality.” Id. at 1322. In White II, on remand after the Supreme\nCourt invalidated Minnesota’s “announce” clause, the Eighth Circuit invalidated a canon\nthat prohibited judicial candidates from “personally solicit[ing] or accept[ing] campaign\ncontributions.” 416 F.3d at 745. In Siefert, ___ F.3d ___, the Seventh Circuit upheld\nWisconsin’s prohibition on judges’ “personal[] solicit[ation]” of campaign contributions.\nSee slip op. at 32–33. But, in doing so, it focused on the problems associated with\n“direct” solicitation and did not consider the validity of applying the canon to mass\nmailings and group solicitations—the most troubling scenarios here. See id. at 30–32.\n\n       The state defendants push back, arguing that, even though a candidate may\ndiscover her donors’ identities from the campaign committee, the solicitation clause\nmakes “favoritism” toward contributors “more difficult.” Commission’s Opening Br.\n\fNos. 08-6468/6538          Carey v. Wolnitzek, et al.                            Page 23\n\n\nat 57. After all, they reason, when a candidate asks for a donation in person, she\nimmediately will find out whether the donor gives and how much. Id. That may or may\nnot be true. But even if we grant the Commonwealth’s premise—that in-person\nsolicitations always lead to more immediate information about donations or\nrejections—that suggests only that the solicitation clause may be constitutional in some\nsettings. It does not resolve the clause’s considerable overbreadth: its application to\nmass-mailing solicitations or speeches to a large audience.\n\n       But the solicitation clause must be constitutional, the state defendants add,\nbecause most other States with judicial elections also prevent candidates from soliciting\nfunds. See Commission’s Opening Br. at 53. The argument is not as helpful as they\nsuggest. By our count, twenty-two States currently elect judges to their highest courts\nin contested elections. (States with retention elections are less relevant because by\ndefinition they do not involve two candidates competing for the same seat.) Of these\ntwenty-two States, thirteen, including Kentucky, prohibit candidates from soliciting\ncampaign contributions. See App’x B. (Two more have hortatory canons telling\ncandidates they “should not” or are “strongly discouraged” from personally soliciting.\nId.) Yet this bare majority is no more dispositive here than it was in White, where\ntwenty-six States had some form of announce clause. See White, 536 U.S. at 786. No\nless importantly, we do not decide today whether a State could enact a narrowly tailored\nsolicitation clause—say, one focused on one-on-one solicitations or solicitations from\nindividuals with cases pending before the court—only that this clause does not do so\nnarrowly.\n\n       The Commonwealth to its credit wishes to avoid cases like Simes v. Ark. Judicial\nDiscipline & Disability Comm’n, 247 S.W.3d 876 (Ark. 2007), where a judge “made\ndirect, personal solicitations” to attorneys who “had cases currently pending in the\njudge’s court.” Id. at 880. But Kentucky’s clause goes well beyond these sorts of\nsolicitations. Kentucky has chosen to elect its judges in competitive elections and must\nabide by some of the risks that go with that decision. See White, 536 U.S. at 792\n(O’Connor, J., concurring). While we do not question Kentucky’s right to select judges\n\fNos. 08-6468/6538          Carey v. Wolnitzek, et al.                              Page 24\n\n\nthrough popular elections, the Commonwealth cannot exempt itself from the demands\nof the First Amendment in the process. See id. at 788 (majority); Geary v. Renne, 911\nF.2d 280, 294 (9th Cir. 1990) (en banc) (Reinhardt, J., concurring) (“The State . . .\ncannot have it both ways. If it wants to elect its judges, it cannot deprive its citizens of\na full and robust election debate.”), vacated on other grounds by Renne v. Geary, 501\nU.S. 312 (1991). The solicitation clause is overbroad and thus invalid on its face.\n\n                                            C.\n\n        The commits clause. In prohibiting judicial candidates from “intentionally or\nrecklessly mak[ing] a statement that a reasonable person would perceive as committing\na judge or candidate to rule a certain way in a case, controversy, or issue that is likely\nto come before the court,” Canon 5B(1)(c), the commits clause covers a range of\ncampaign statements. Some of those restrictions are legitimate. Others may not be.\nAnd there is a “vast middle ground of uncertainty” between the two. Outlaw v. Airtech\nAir Conditioning & Heating, Inc., 412 F.3d 156, 161 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (Roberts, J.).\n\n        In what seems to be its core sense, the clause, found in one form or another in 39\nStates, see App’x C, runs the gauntlet of strict scrutiny. By preventing candidates from\nmaking “statement[s]” that “commit[]” them “to rule a certain way in a case [or]\ncontroversy,” the clause secures a basic objective of the judiciary, one so basic that due\nprocess requires it: that litigants have a right to air their disputes before judges who\nhave not committed to rule against them before the opening brief is read. See Caperton,\n129 S. Ct. at 2266–67; Bracy v. Gramley, 520 U.S. 899, 904–05 (1997). Whatever else\na fair adjudication requires, it demands that judges decide cases based on the law and\nfacts before them, not based on “express . . . commitments that they may have made to\ntheir campaign supporters.” Buckley v. Ill. Judicial Inquiry Bd., 997 F.2d 224, 227 (7th\nCir. 1993). No one, Carey included, disputes that the Commonwealth has a compelling\ninterest in “prohibit[ing] candidates from promising to rule a certain way on cases.”\nCarey’s Opening Br. at 14–15.\n\n        Nor does Carey dispute that the clause narrowly advances this interest—if, that\nis, the clause is confined to campaign “commitments” with respect to “cases” or\n\fNos. 08-6468/6538          Carey v. Wolnitzek, et al.                             Page 25\n\n\n“controversies.” So limited, the clause targets the kinds of interests White suggests the\nStates may protect, as judicial commitments with respect to cases and controversies\nimplicate not just a lack of open mindedness about the law but a lack of impartiality in\nits most essential sense—a commitment to rule for one party over another. See White,\n536 U.S. at 775–76 (“[I]mpartiality” in “the traditional sense” means “apply[ing] the law\nto [one party] in the same way [one] applies it to any other party.”). The First\nAmendment permits a State to limit speech when the Due Process Clause demands\nnothing less.\n\n       But the canon does not stop there. It also prevents candidates from making\ncommitments about “issues.” A commitment to rule a certain way on “issues likely to\ncome before the court” covers a raft of electioneering stands, and it unmoors the\nprohibition from “cases” or “controversies” and the party-specific connotations that\ncome with those terms. As White reminds us, “there is almost no legal or political issue\nthat is unlikely to come before a judge of an American court, state or federal, of general\njurisdiction.” White, 536 U.S. at 772 (emphasis added and quotation omitted). To make\nmatters worse, the commentary to the clause says that it covers the “appearance” of\nmaking “issue”-related commitments. Canon 5B(1)(c), Cmt.\n\n       Think back to White. How is a judicial candidate’s “announcement” of a position\non a legal “issue” during an election campaign not likely to create the “appearance” that\nthe candidate has “committed” to “rule a certain way” on the “issue”? And, if that is so,\nhow can this aspect of the canon survive White, given that it seems to ban what White\npermits? These are good questions, but they prompt an even more basic one: what\nexactly does the “issues” prohibition cover?\n\n       The clause contains a serious level-of-generality problem. At the broadest level\nof meaning, it would seem to cover issue-related promises like these: “I commit to\nfollow stare decisis”; “I commit to follow an originalist theory of constitutional\ninterpretation” or for that matter “a living constitutionalist theory”; “I commit to a\npurposive method of statutory interpretation” or for that matter a “textual” one; “I\ncommit to use (or not to use) legislative history”; or “I commit to be a rule-of-law\n\fNos. 08-6468/6538          Carey v. Wolnitzek, et al.                             Page 26\n\n\njudge.” One might reasonably say that the clause covers all of these statements, as they\nall relate to “issues” likely to come before a court and they all create an “appearance”\nof commitment. Yet if that is what the clause means, it is hard to square with the\nConstitution. A restriction on such promises does nothing to prevent the kind of\n“impartiality” that the States have an interest in securing—defined as bias (or the\nappearance of bias) toward particular parties or cases. See White, 536 U.S. at 776–77.\n\n       In a narrower sense, however, the “issues” prohibition may serve that interest.\nIn White itself, the Court contemplated that a State could prevent a candidate from\nhighlighting an “unbroken record of affirming convictions for rape” because such\nstatements would “exhibit a bias against parties,” namely against these types of criminal\ndefendants and in favor of the prosecutor in these types of appeals. 536 U.S. at 777 n.7;\nid. at 800–01 (Stevens, J., dissenting). An interpretation of the clause confined to these\nkinds of statements thus might advance a compelling state interest and do so narrowly.\n\n       In a facial challenge like this one, the ultimate question is one of overbreadth:\nDoes the law “prohibit[] a substantial amount of protected speech both in an absolute\nsense and relative to [the canons’] plainly legitimate sweep”? Connection Distrib. Co.,\n557 F.3d at 336 (internal quotations omitted). To determine the extent of a law’s\nillegitimate reach, one needs to know what it means, as “it is impossible to determine\nwhether a statute reaches too far without first knowing what the statute covers.” United\nStates v. Williams, 553 U.S. 285, 293 (2008).\n\n       That inquiry has not happened here—at least with respect to the “issues”\nprohibition. In upholding this clause, the district court focused on its application to\n“cases” and “controversies” and, to that extent, we agree with its analysis for the reasons\nnoted. But the district court did not explore the clause’s applicability to “issues,” the\narray of settings in which that part of the clause and commentary may apply and the\ntension of several of them with White. At oral argument, we asked the parties about the\npoint. Carey agreed that the commits clause would satisfy the First Amendment if the\nclause did not contain an “issues” component to it, and saw the addition of the “issues”\nlanguage (together with the commentary) as having two impermissible effects: chilling\n\fNos. 08-6468/6538          Carey v. Wolnitzek, et al.                              Page 27\n\n\ncandidates’ free-speech rights to discuss their legal philosophies freely, and effectively\nsidestepping White by prohibiting candidates from announcing their positions on legal\nissues. The state defendants suggested that a narrowing construction of the “issues”\nclause could save it.\n\n        Under these circumstances, discretion, to say nothing of respect for a co-equal\nsovereign, is the better part of valor.        At this point it is not clear what the\nCommonwealth’s position on the term is, and the district court has not yet explored these\nissues. If we remand this aspect of the case to the district court, the court will have that\nchance.    So too will the parties—particularly the state defendants, who retain\nconsiderable authority over shaping the clause and the commentary that goes with it.\nThe state defendants may be able to obtain authority to remove the “issues” language;\nthey may be able to identify an acceptable narrowing construction of the “issues”\nlanguage along with a modification to the commentary; or they may suggest certification\nto the Kentucky Supreme Court. Any of these options may spare the federal courts the\ntask of resolving a difficult constitutional question, and at a minimum they will give the\nCommonwealth a first shot at addressing the question.\n\fNos. 08-6468/6538           Carey v. Wolnitzek, et al.

Yet there is no room for debate that, if a State opts to select its\njudges through popular elections, it must comply with the First Amendment in doing so.\nIn this case, we have upheld some components of Kentucky’s Code of Judicial Conduct,\ninvalidated others and sought clarification of still one other provision. Through it all,\nno one should lose sight of the reality that a judicial candidate’s right to engage in\ncertain types of speech says nothing about the desirability of that speech. The First\nAmendment protects the meek and brazen, the “offensive” and agreeable. Texas v.\nJohnson, 491 U.S. 397, 414 (1989). Today’s case is about the meaning of the First\nAmendment, not about the virtues of some types of judicial campaign speech relative to\nothers.\n\n                                            V.\n\n          For these reasons, we affirm the district court’s judgment as to the party\naffiliation and solicitation clauses and vacate its judgment as to the commits clause and\nremand the case for further consideration of the meaning and validity of that clause.\n\fNos. 08-6468/6538       Carey v.

I would go further and affirm the District Court in upholding the entire\ncommits clause, including the issues portion. The majority’s concern with an overly\nbroad interpretation of what constitutes a commitment to vote a certain way or bias\ntoward a party based on campaign promises regarding an “issue,” amounts to the\nconstruction of a straw man. I believe a candidate for judge knows exactly when she is\nmaking a commitment, or giving the appearance of such a commitment. I believe the\nsame is true of the enforcer of the canons. Is there any doubt about commitment when\na candidate professes to believe that life begins at conception? Is there any committed\nbias in favor of a potential party when a candidate for judge states a “strong belief in the\nright to keep and bear arms?”         Maybe the definition of White-permitted issue\ncommitments is like the definition of pornography.

The canon here appropriately addresses that interest.                Definitional\ndisagreements, if they arise, can be addressed when they arise.\n\n        I respectfully dissent from the holding of the majority vacating the District Court\nin respect to the commits clause.\n\f",

WISEMAN, D.J. (p. 219), delivered a separate opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>OPINION</h2>\n<p>SUTTON, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>Imagine if a State imposed these restrictions on candidates for election to the legislature: (1) They \"shall not identify\" themselves \"as a member of a political party in any form of advertising or when speaking to a gathering\"; (2) they \"shall not solicit campaign funds\"; and (3) they \"shall not ... make a statement that a reasonable person would perceive as committing\" the candidate to vote \"a certain way on a[n] ... issue\" likely to come before the legislature. A court faced with a First (and Fourteenth) Amendment challenge to the law would make short work of it. Legislative candidates have a First Amendment right to associate publicly with a political party, <i>see </i><i>Tashjian v. Republican Party of Conn.,</i> 479 U.S. 208, 214, 107 S.Ct. 544, 93 L.Ed.2d 514 (1986), to solicit campaign funds, <i>see </i><i>Riley v. Nat'l Fed. of the Blind of N.C.,</i> 487 U.S. 781, 796, 108 S.Ct. 2667, 101 L.Ed.2d 669 (1988), and to communicate to their constituents how they will vote on the issues of the day, <i>see </i><i>Brown v. Hartlage,</i> 456 U.S. 45, 55-59, 102 S.Ct. 1523, 71 L.Ed.2d 732 (1982). It is doubtful that a single federal or state court judge in the country would see it differently.</p>\n<p>Yet what happens if the same restrictions apply to judicial elections, not legislative elections? Some say the answer is the same. Elections are elections, and the same First Amendment applies to all of them. When the government suppresses election speech based on its contentprohibiting candidates from mentioning a political party with whom they affiliate, barring them from putting their name on a fund-raising letter or telling them what they can and cannot say about their judicial philosophythe most rigorous form of constitutional second-guessing applies, and no categorical exemption from the First Amendment spares the government from this burden. In modern America, judicial elections are no less relevant to the public policy concerns of the citizenry than legislative elections, and the First Amendment protects electioneering speech in the one context as vigorously as it does in the other. Concerns about impartiality and open-mindedness that might result from unfettered judicial campaigning can be handled after the elections, not before, through the application of case-by-case judicial recusal rules that all States require their judges to follow before they agree to hear a case. Any remaining concerns flow not from the absence of speech restrictions on judicial candidates but from the State's insistence on holding elections for judicial office in the first place. A State cannot simultaneously insist that judges be held accountable to the electorate at regular intervals but deny to sitting judges and candidates alike the communicative tools for explaining how they will be held to account.</p>\n<p>Others say it is not that easy. Judges do not represent constituents. They apply the law to the facts one case at a time, and, if they represent anyone or anything, it is the rule of law, which is why they sometimes must rule <i>against</i> the policy preferences of a majority of the voters. The judicial process works only when it is done in a disinterested manner, which is inconsistent with campaigns in which judges commit to rule, or appear to commit to rule, in a certain way in certain cases. It <span class=\"star-pagination\">*194</span> is one thing when a legislator solicits money during a campaign; it is quite another when a judicial candidate, a sitting judge above all, does the same. With a few modest exceptions, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co.,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 129 S.Ct. 2252, 173 L.Ed.2d 1208 (2009); Mich. Court Rule 2.003, judicial-recusal rules are self-enforced and therefore may not provide adequate safeguards against the risks that flow from treating judicial elections like legislative ones. Unlike the other branches of government, the authority of the judiciary turns almost exclusively on its credibility and the respect warranted by its rulings, both of which are likely to be diminished by free-flowing electoral speech that permits the malignant inference that there is such a thing as caucus-bound blue-robed judges and caucus-bound red-robed judges. In some settings, there can be too much of a good thing, and unfettered free speech in judicial elections is one of them.</p>\n<p>This is a complicated debate, and today's case requires us to take a side on some of these issues. Most recently in 2005, the Kentucky Supreme Court promulgated a judicial canon along the lines of the hypothetical legislative campaign rules mentioned above. As sitting judges ourselves, we have considerable sympathy for the concerns that prompted the canon, so much so that we embrace a central premise of it: Judicial elections differ from legislative elections, and the Kentucky Supreme Court has a compelling interest in regulating judicial campaign speech to ensure the reality and appearance of an impartial judiciary. Yet because two clauses of the canon overlooked narrower ways of advancing this interest and because, as written, they remain incompatible with the United States Supreme Court's decision in <i>Republican Party of Minnesota v. White,</i> 536 U.S. 765, 122 S.Ct. 2528, 153 L.Ed.2d 694 (2002), we must invalidate them. The third clause is constitutional in the main but contains a material ambiguity, which requires further consideration by the district court. The district court's decision is affirmed in part and vacated in part.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A.</h2>\n<p>In 1792, Kentucky became the fifteenth State (and the fourth Commonwealth). The original Kentucky Constitution permitted the Governor to appoint judges, <i>see</i> Ky. Const. art. 2, § 8 (1792), but the Commonwealth, in the aftermath of the Age of Jackson, amended its Constitution in 1850 to require its judges to stand for popular election to eight-year terms. <i>See</i> Ky. Const. § 117; Ky. Const. art. 4, §§ 4, 6 (1850). Since 1975, judicial elections in Kentucky have been \"nonpartisan,\" <i>compare</i> Ky. Const. § 116 (1891) <i>with</i> Ky. Const. § 117 (1976), meaning that political parties have no formal role in any stage of the judicial selection process. Prospective candidates submit petitions for nomination to the Secretary of State. Ky.Rev.Stat. Ann. § 118A.060. The Commonwealth holds a single primary election for each judicial seat with no party identifiers and random ballot positioning. <i>Id.</i> The top two vote-getters in the primary election receive a spot on the general election ballot, which also is held without any party identifier. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>In competing for judicial seats, all candidates must abide by the Kentucky Code of Judicial Conduct. Promulgated by the Kentucky Supreme Court, it generally prohibits \"a judge or judicial candidate\" from \"inappropriate political activity.\" Rules of Supreme Court of Kentucky 3.130(8.2); 4.300, Canon 5. Sitting judges or judicial candidates violate this admonition, the Code says, if they fail to follow these clauses of Canon 5, among others:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*195</span> <i>The party affiliation clause.</i> \"A judge or candidate shall not identify himself or herself as a member of a political party in any form of advertising, or when speaking to a gathering. If not initiated by the judge or candidate for such office, and only in answer to a direct question, the judge or candidate may identify himself or herself as a member of a particular political party.\" Canon 5(A)(2).</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<i>The solicitation clause.</i> \"A judge or a candidate for judicial office shall not solicit campaign funds, but may establish committees of responsible persons to secure and manage the expenditure of funds for the campaign and to obtain public statements of support for the candidacy.\" Canon 5(B)(2).</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<i>The commits clause.</i> \"A judge or candidate for election to judicial office ... shall not intentionally or recklessly make a statement that a reasonable person would perceive as committing the judge or candidate to rule a certain way in a case, controversy, or issue that is likely to come before the court....\" Canon 5(B)(1)(c).</blockquote>\n<p>The Kentucky Judicial Conduct Commission, a constitutionally mandated state body subject to judicial review by the Kentucky Supreme Court, <i>see</i> Ky. Const. § 121, enforces the Code of Judicial Conduct. It may impose sanctions on violators of the Code, which run the gamut from a private reprimand to a public censure to removal from office to a referral to the Kentucky Bar Association for disbarment from the practice of law. Rules of Supreme Court of Kentucky 4.020. The Kentucky Inquiry Commission and the Office of Bar Counsel also police ethical violations by Kentucky attorneys, including violations of the rule that \"[a] lawyer who is a candidate for judicial office shall comply with the applicable provisions of the Code of Judicial Conduct.\" Rules of Supreme Court of Kentucky 3.130(8.2); 3.160(1).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B.</h2>\n<p>In June 2006, Marcus Carey, then a candidate for a seat on the Kentucky Supreme Court, filed a complaint in federal district court claiming that the party affiliation, solicitation and commits clauses violated his speech and associational rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution. The named defendants sit on the Kentucky Judicial Conduct Commission, sit on the Kentucky Inquiry Commission or serve as Bar Counsel.</p>\n<p>Carey complained that he wanted to disclose his party status, yet he feared the party affiliation clause barred him from doing so. He wanted to ask for campaign contributions by signing fund-raising letters, yet he feared the solicitation clause barred him from doing so. And he wished to respond to a judicial questionnaire distributed by Kentucky Right to Life, raising questions for the candidates about their judicial philosophy and about their positions on specific issues, yet he feared the commits clause barred him from doing so. He asked the court to declare the clauses unconstitutional on their face and to enjoin their enforcement.</p>\n<p>In October 2006, roughly one month before the election, the district court preliminarily enjoined enforcement of the party affiliation and the solicitation clauses but dismissed Carey's challenge to the commits clause on ripeness and standing grounds. On November 2, Carey moved to amend his complaint, re-challenging the commits clause, this time detailing the statements he proposed to make in possible violation of the clause. About a week later, Carey lost the election.</p>\n<p>In September 2007, the court ruled that Carey's amended challenge to the commits <span class=\"star-pagination\">*196</span> clause was ripe for review and allowed it to proceed along with Carey's challenges to the party affiliation and solicitation clauses. The parties all moved for summary judgment. In ruling on the motions, the district court determined that strict scrutiny applied to all of the challenges. It then invalidated the party affiliation and solicitation clauses on their face but rejected Carey's facial challenge to the commits clause. The state defendants appeal the court's ruling on the party affiliation and solicitation clauses, and Carey appeals the court's ruling on the commits clause.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>Before turning to the merits, we must consider two jurisdictional questions implicated by these challenges: Did Carey file his claims too early, making them unripe for judicial review, or too late, making them moot? <i>See </i><i>Warshak v. United States,</i> 532 F.3d 521, 525 (6th Cir.2008) (en banc).</p>\n<p><i>Ripeness.</i> Designed to ensure that the federal courts resolve \"existing, substantial controversies,\" <i>Norton v. Ashcroft,</i> 298 F.3d 547, 554 (6th Cir.2002), not disputes \"anchored in future events that may not occur as anticipated\" or may not occur \"at all,\" <i>Nat'l Rifle Ass'n of Am. v. Magaw,</i> 132 F.3d 272, 284 (6th Cir.1997), the ripeness doctrine ensures that a dispute is concrete and real before the judicial branch resolves it. Three considerations inform the doctrine: Is the alleged injury likely to occur? Is the factual record sufficiently developed to resolve the question? And what kinds of hardships, if any, will the parties face if the court delays resolution of the question? <i>Warshak,</i> 532 F.3d at 525. In the context of a free-speech overbreadth challenge like this one, a relaxed ripeness standard applies to steer clear of the risk that the law \"may cause others not before the court to refrain from constitutionally protected speech or expression.\" <i>Broadrick v. Oklahoma,</i> 413 U.S. 601, 612, 93 S.Ct. 2908, 37 L.Ed.2d 830 (1973).</p>\n<p>Carey meets these requirements. In future judicial elections, as in prior ones, he claims an interest in engaging in protected speech that implicates, if not violates, each clause. He wants to let voters know his party affiliation. He wants to solicit campaign funds directly, as opposed to indirectly via an election committee. And he wants to answer judicial questionnaires propounded by a local right-to-life organization. These aspects of the canon at least chill, and in some instances prohibit, these forms of communication, and in the course of the November 2006 election, at least until the entry of the October 2006 injunction, Carey censored himself on each topic. All of this establishes a \"credible fear of enforcement,\" <i>Norton,</i> 298 F.3d at 554, sufficient to overcome any ripeness concerns.</p>\n<p>The Kentucky Judicial Conduct Commission persists that the Kentucky Supreme Court and its ethics branch, the Kentucky Judicial Ethics Committee, have yet to apply these clauses to Carey, noting that \"an authoritative construction of the canons may significantly alter the constitutional questions.\" Commission's Opening Br. at 22. That is all true, but it is a peculiar ground for staying our hand now with respect to <i>all</i> of these challenges, some of which involve clauses with little ambiguity. <i>See </i><i>City of Lakewood v. Plain Dealer Pub. Co.,</i> 486 U.S. 750, 770 n. 11, 108 S.Ct. 2138, 100 L.Ed.2d 771 (1988). This challenge dates from July 2006, and a related challenge, supported by the same counsel, dates from September 2004, <i>see </i><i>Family Trust Found. of Ky., Inc. v. Wolnitzek,</i> 345 F.Supp.2d 672 (E.D.Ky.2004). The Commission has had ample time to request interpretations or modifications of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*197</span> Canon 5 by the Committee or the Court, yet apparently has not done so. Nor has the Commission, or anyone else in this case, asked the federal courts to certify any questions to the Kentucky Supreme Court. These claims are ripe for review.</p>\n<p><i>Mootness.</i> In one sense, Carey's original challenge seems moot because the November 2006 election has come and gone. Carey filed his original complaint months ahead of the election, and moved to amend it a week before the election, yet here we are more than three years after the election, still considering his claims. Carey, however, retains the right to run for judicial office again, and all candidates for judicial office in Kentucky, whether sitting judges or not, are subject to Canon 5. Under these circumstances, the claims may proceed: The alleged wrongs are \"capable of repetition, yet evading review,\" saving them from mootness, as the district court correctly held and as the parties do not dispute. <i>See </i><i>Fed. Election Comm'n v. Wis. Right to Life, Inc.,</i> 551 U.S. 449, 462, 127 S.Ct. 2652, 168 L.Ed.2d 329 (2007); <i>Briggs v. Ohio Elections Comm'n,</i> 61 F.3d 487, 492-93 (6th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A.</h2>\n<p>Two recent decisions of the Supreme Court<i>White</i> and <i>Caperton</i>set the stage for resolving the merits of this dispute. At issue in <i>White</i> was a judicial canon, first promulgated by Minnesota in 1974, providing that \"a candidate for a judicial office, including an incumbent judge,\" shall not \"announce his or her views on disputed legal or political issues.\" Minn.Code of Judicial Conduct, Canon 5(A)(3)(d)(i); <i>White,</i> 536 U.S. at 768, 122 S.Ct. 2528. Applying strict scrutiny, the Court rejected Minnesota's contention that the canon preserved judicial \"impartiality\" in a permissible way.</p>\n<p>To the extent the Minnesota announce clause sought to preserve judicial \"impartiality\" in one sensea \"lack of bias for or against either <i>party</i> to the proceeding,\" <i>id.</i> at 775, 122 S.Ct. 2528the Court accepted the State's interest as a compelling one. <i>Id.</i> at 777 n. 7, 122 S.Ct. 2528. But the clause suffered from a means-end problem because it did \"not restrict speech for or against particular <i>parties,</i> but rather speech for or against particular <i>issues.</i>\" <i>Id.</i> at 776, 122 S.Ct. 2528. It may be, the Court acknowledged, that, \"when a case arises that turns on a legal issue on which the judge (as a candidate) had taken a particular stand, the party taking the opposite stand is likely to lose,\" but that is not due to \"any bias against that party\" for \"[<i>a</i>]<i>ny</i> party taking that position is just as likely to lose.\" <i>Id.</i> at 776-77, 122 S.Ct. 2528.</p>\n<p>To the extent the State meant to advance \"impartiality\" in another sensean absence of judicial \"preconception in favor of or against a particular <i>legal view</i>\"that was not a compelling interest. <i>Id.</i> at 777, 122 S.Ct. 2528. \"[S]ince avoiding judicial preconceptions on legal issues is neither possible nor desirable, pretending otherwise by attempting to preserve the `appearance' of that type of impartiality can hardly be a compelling state interest either.\" <i>Id.</i> at 778, 122 S.Ct. 2528.</p>\n<p>And to the extent the State meant to promote \"impartiality\" in the sense of judicial \"open-mindedness\"the \"willing[ness] to consider views that oppose [one's] preconceptions\"the Court found it unnecessary to decide whether this \"desirable\" quality amounted to a compelling interest. <i>Id.</i> at 778, 122 S.Ct. 2528. It held that the clause was so poorly tailored to any interest in open-mindedness that the Minnesota Supreme Court could not have \"adopted <span class=\"star-pagination\">*198</span> the announce clause for that purpose.\" <i>Id.</i> Judges, both incumbent and prospective, it reasoned, retained so many ways to communicate their views on legal issues other than through election statements that the clause gratuitously limited speech while \"leav[ing] appreciable damage to that supposedly vital interest unprohibited.\" <i>Id.</i> at 780, 122 S.Ct. 2528.</p>\n<p><i>Caperton</i> dealt with a sitting state supreme court justice whose top campaign donor in the previous election, the head of a mining company, had spent $3 million on his behalfmore than all of his other supporters combined. <i>See </i><i>Caperton,</i> 129 S.Ct. at 2257. When a high-stakes dispute involving the mining company came before the court, the justice refused to recuse himself from hearing it and ultimately joined the 3-2 majority in ruling for the company. <i>See id.</i> at 2258. The losing party claimed that the justice's participation in the case violated its due process rights. The Supreme Court agreed, holding that, by refusing to disqualify himself, the justice had unconstitutionally deprived the parties of a fair hearing. <i>See id.</i> at 2265. When \"there is a serious risk of actual bias,\" the Court reasoned, the Constitution requires judges to disqualify themselves, though the Court cautioned that this was \"an extraordinary situation,\" emphasizing the size of the mining company's support relative to other donors' support, the apparently decisive effect of this support on the justice's election and the close temporal connection between the justice's election and the company's case. <i>Id.</i> at 2263, 2265.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B.</h2>\n<p>Strict scrutiny applies to all three aspects of this First Amendment challenge. <i>White,</i> for one, suggests as much, even if the decision does not compel that conclusion. In striking down Minnesota's announce clause, the Court said the following about the standard of review:</p>\n<blockquote>As the Court of Appeals recognized, the announce clause both prohibits speech on the basis of its content and burdens a category of speech that is \"at the core of our First Amendment freedoms\"speech about the qualifications of candidates for public office. [<i>Republican Party of Minn. v. Kelly</i><i>,</i>] 247 F.3d [854] at 861, 863 [ (2001) ]. The Court of Appeals concluded that the proper test to be applied to determine the constitutionality of such a restriction is what our cases have called strict scrutiny, <i>id.,</i> at 864; the parties do not dispute that this is correct.</blockquote>\n<p>536 U.S. at 774, 122 S.Ct. 2528.</p>\n<p>The state defendants seize on the modest length of the Court's analysis and Minnesota's concession, arguing that we need not apply strict scrutiny here. But <i>White's</i> brevity on this score and Minnesota's concession may suggest something else: that the counter-argument has little to support it. The multi-State amicus brief filed in support of Minnesota did not question the applicability of strict scrutiny in <i>White. See</i> Brief Amicus Curiae of California, <i>et al.</i> in Support of Respondents, <i>Republican Party of Minn. v. Kelly,</i> 536 U.S. 765 (2002). Not one of the Justices, not even one of the four dissenters, objected to the application of strict scrutiny. And if strict scrutiny does not apply to judicial canons like this one and the one at issue in <i>White,</i> it is difficult to understand why the Court exercised its discretion in reviewing <i>White,</i> given that virtually the entire analysis is premised on the applicability of strict scrutiny and given that the outcome of the case under a lower level of scrutiny is far from clear.</p>\n<p>Free-speech first principles also suggest that strict scrutiny <i>should</i> apply. The three canons censor speech based on its <span class=\"star-pagination\">*199</span> content in the most basic of ways: They prevent candidates from speaking about some subjects (judicial philosophy, the legal issues of the day, party affiliation) but not others (experience); and they prevent candidates from asking for support in some ways (campaign funds) but not others (a vote, yard signs). The canons refer directly to, and are \"justified with[ ] reference to,\" the content of candidates' speech, meaning they are not eligible for the relaxed review that content-neutral restrictions receive. <i>Ward v. Rock Against Racism,</i> 491 U.S. 781, 791, 109 S.Ct. 2746, 105 L.Ed.2d 661 (1989).</p>\n<p>Content-based restrictions on speech generally face strict scrutiny, <i>see </i><i>United States v. Playboy Entm't Group, Inc.,</i> 529 U.S. 803, 813, 120 S.Ct. 1878, 146 L.Ed.2d 865 (2000), and thus are \"presumptively invalid\" unless the restriction discriminates on the basis of categorically \"proscribable\" speech, <i>see </i><i>R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul,</i> 505 U.S. 377, 382-83, 112 S.Ct. 2538, 120 L.Ed.2d 305 (1992). <i>See also </i><i>United States v. Stevens,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 130 S.Ct. 1577, 1584, 176 L.Ed.2d 435 (2010). None of the categorical carve-outs apply. The canons do not address \"fighting words\" or incitement, <i>see </i><i>Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire,</i> 315 U.S. 568, 572, 62 S.Ct. 766, 86 L.Ed. 1031 (1942), defamation, <i>see </i><i>Beauharnais v. Illinois,</i> 343 U.S. 250, 72 S.Ct. 725, 96 L.Ed. 919 (1952), obscenity, <i>see </i><i>Roth v. United States,</i> 354 U.S. 476, 77 S.Ct. 1304, 1 L.Ed.2d 1498 (1957), or child pornography, <i>see </i><i>New York v. Ferber,</i> 458 U.S. 747, 764, 102 S.Ct. 3348, 73 L.Ed.2d 1113 (1982). Far from implicating these exceptions, today's regulations implicate a core area of free-speech protection: elections. <i>See </i><i>Brown,</i> 456 U.S. at 53-54, 102 S.Ct. 1523; <i>see also </i><i>Stevens,</i> 130 S.Ct. at 1586 (declining to declare \"depictions of animal cruelty\" as a \"new categor[y] of speech outside the scope of the First Amendment\").</p>\n<p>Nor does the nature of the restrictions implicate any of the other areas or types of regulationtime, place and manner restrictions, commercial speech, expressive conductin which the Court has applied less-than-rigorous review. The canons instead are of a piece with the kinds of speech regulationtelling candidates what they can and cannot say before an electionthat the courts have scrutinized most rigorously. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Brown,</i> 456 U.S. at 53-54, 102 S.Ct. 1523; <i>see also</i> Erwin Chemerinsky, <i>Restrictions on the Speech of Judicial Candidates are Unconstitutional,</i> 35 Ind. L. Rev. 735, 740-742 (2002) (explaining that strict scrutiny should apply to First Amendment challenges to judicial canons like these); Mark Spottswood, Comment, <i>Free Speech and Due Process Problems in the Regulation and Financing of Judicial Election Campaigns,</i> 101 Nw. U. L. REV. 331, 347 (2007) (same).</p>\n<p>The Commission does not cite a single case, and we have not found one on our own, applying anything less than strict scrutiny to comparable free-speech challenges to judicial election canons. After <i>White,</i> the Eighth Circuit applied strict scrutiny to Minnesota's party affiliation and solicitation clauses. <i>See </i><i>Republican Party of Minn. v. White,</i> 416 F.3d 738, 749 (8th Cir.2005) (en banc) (<i>\"White II\"</i>). After <i>White,</i> the Eleventh Circuit did the same in invalidating Georgia's rules prohibiting judicial candidates from soliciting campaign funds. <i>See </i><i>Weaver v. Bonner,</i> 309 F.3d 1312, 1319 (11th Cir.2002). After <i>White,</i> the Seventh Circuit applied strict scrutiny to Wisconsin's party affiliation clause and held that Wisconsin's solicitation clause survived both intermediate and strict scrutiny. <i>See </i><i>Siefert v. Alexander,</i> 608 F.3d 974, 978, 981 (7th Cir.2010). And, before <i>White,</i> the Third Circuit applied <span class=\"star-pagination\">*200</span> strict scrutiny in upholding some judicial speech restrictions. <i>See </i><i>Stretton v. Disciplinary Bd. of Supreme Court of Pa.,</i> 944 F.2d 137, 141-42 (3d Cir.1991).</p>\n<p>The Commission urges us to apply a form of intermediate scrutiny, which balances the \"competing fundamental rights\" of some judicial candidates (who have a right to engage in campaign speech) and some litigants (who have a right to an impartial judiciary). Commission's Opening Br. at 10. But the reality that judicial impartiality is a \"vital state interest,\" protected by the Due Process Clause, <i>Caperton,</i> 129 S.Ct. at 2266-67, does not require us to dilute the First Amendment. It establishes instead that Kentucky has a compelling interest in preserving the canon, proving that the State can satisfy the first requirement of strict scrutiny, not that, having satisfied this requirement, it may water down the remaining requirements.</p>\n<p>The Commission's analogy to <i>Gentile v. State Bar of Nevada,</i> 501 U.S. 1030, 111 S.Ct. 2720, 115 L.Ed.2d 888 (1991), does not hold up. <i>Gentile</i> \"balance[d]\" litigants' fair trial rights with attorneys' free speech rights in upholding a rule prohibiting attorneys involved in a pending trial from making statements likely to prejudice the proceedings. <i>Id.</i> at 1075, 111 S.Ct. 2720. As these features of the decision suggest, <i>Gentile</i> applies only to speech restrictions imposed on attorneys during a pending case, <i>see id.</i> at 1073 n. 5, 111 S.Ct. 2720, which is one reasonthere are otherswhy a comparable law restricting judges from telling the press about the outcome of a pending case would not be an unconstitutional prior restraint on speech. Today, however, we have a speech restriction aimed not at judges performing court functions but at judges and judicial candidates making campaign statements or solicitations outside of court and outside of the process of deciding cases in their official capacityall for the purpose of communicating information to voters about whom they should elect. That <i>Gentile</i> upholds a law restricting a lawyer's speech during a trial does not mean that it allows restrictions on lawyers in all settings. Otherwise, a lawyer running to be the Attorney General or Governor of a State could be censored simply because she is an \"officer of the court.\" That is not the case.</p>\n<p>The Commission insists that the solicitation clause is an especially poor candidate for strict scrutiny review, because the Supreme Court applies a \"lesser\" standard of review to restrictions on political donations. <i>See </i><i>McConnell v. Fed. Election Comm'n,</i> 540 U.S. 93, 136, 124 S.Ct. 619, 157 L.Ed.2d 491 (2003). But this argument gives analogy a bad name. The solicitation clause does not set a contribution limit, as in <i>McConnell</i> and similar cases. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Fed. Election Comm'n v. Nat'l Right to Work Comm.,</i> 459 U.S. 197, 208, 103 S.Ct. 552, 74 L.Ed.2d 364 (1982). It flatly prohibits <i>speech,</i> not donations, based on the topic (solicitation of a contribution) and speaker (a judge or judicial candidate)precisely the kind of content-based regulations that traditionally warrant strict scrutiny.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C.</h2>\n<p>Because strict scrutiny applies, the Commission faces a daunting gauntlet, as \"it is the rare\" law that \"survives\" this kind of review. <i>Burson v. Freeman,</i> 504 U.S. 191, 211, 112 S.Ct. 1846, 119 L.Ed.2d 5 (1992). To survive, the three canons must be \"narrowly tailored\" to advance a \"compelling state interest.\" <i>Eu v. San Francisco County Democratic Cent. Comm.,</i> 489 U.S. 214, 222, 109 S.Ct. 1013, 103 L.Ed.2d 271 (1989).</p>\n<p>At the same time, Carey seeks to invalidate these clauses not just as applied <span class=\"star-pagination\">*201</span> to him but in all of their applications, which is to say on their face. In most constitutional cases, that exceptional remedy requires the claimant to \"show one of two things: (1) that there truly are `no' or at least few `circumstances' in `which the Act would be valid,' <i>United States v. Salerno,</i> 481 U.S. 739, 745, 107 S.Ct. 2095, 95 L.Ed.2d 697 (1987); <i>see also </i><i>Wash. State Grange v. Wash. State Republican Party,</i> 552 U.S. 442, 449-50, 128 S.Ct. 1184, 170 L.Ed.2d 151 (2008); or (2) that a court cannot sever the unconstitutional textual provisions of the law or enjoin its unconstitutional applications.\" <i>Connection Distrib. Co. v. Holder,</i> 557 F.3d 321, 335 (6th Cir.2009) (en banc). The courts, however, \"rightly lighten this load in the context of free-speech challenges to the facial validity of a law.\" <i>Id.</i> In view of the risk that \"enforcement of an overbroad law\" may \"deter[ ] people from engaging in constitutionally protected speech\" and may \"inhibit[ ] the free exchange of ideas,\" the overbreadth doctrine permits courts to invalidate a law on its face \"if `a substantial number of its applications are unconstitutional, judged in relation to the statute's plainly legitimate sweep.'\" <i>Stevens,</i> 130 S.Ct. at 1587 (quoting <i>Wash. State Grange,</i> 552 U.S. at 449 n. 6, 128 S.Ct. 1184).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV.</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A.</h2>\n<p><i>Party affiliation clause.</i> This clause prohibits judges and candidates from disclosing their party affiliation \"in any form of advertising, or when speaking to a gathering,\" save in answer to a question by a voter in one-on-one or \"very small private informal\" settings. Rules of Supreme Court of Kentucky 4.300, Canon 5(A)(2); Kentucky Judicial Ethics Opinion JE-105 (2004). The clause advances at least two interests, both sufficiently compelling to satisfy the First Amendment. It furthers the Commonwealth's goal of having a judiciary that is biased neither in fact nor in appearance. <i>See </i><i>White,</i> 536 U.S. at 775-79, 122 S.Ct. 2528. And it furthers the Commonwealth's interest in diminishing reliance on political parties in judicial selection, a policy grounded in the Kentucky Constitution's requirement that judicial elections be nonpartisan in nature.</p>\n<p>The problem, however, is not the Commonwealth's laudable interests in promulgating this canon; it is the Commonwealth's methods in furthering them. The Court frequently says that censoring speech must be a government's measure of \"lastnot firstresort\" in advancing its policy interests, <i>e.g., </i><i>Thompson v. W. States Med. Ctr.,</i> 535 U.S. 357, 373, 122 S.Ct. 1497, 152 L.Ed.2d 563 (2002), and the narrow-tailoring requirement is proof that the Court means it. If a law does too much, or does too little, to advance the government's objectives, it will fail. <i>See </i><i>Eu,</i> 489 U.S. at 222, 109 S.Ct. 1013. This canon does both.</p>\n<p>The canon's first problem is a <i>White</i> problemthat it suppresses too much speech to advance the government's interest. In invalidating Minnesota's announce clause, <i>White</i> established that a State may not prohibit a judicial candidate from disclosing, say, that \"I am for limited government,\" \"I support a woman's right to choose,\" \"I prefer tough-on-crime laws,\" or, to use an example from <i>White,</i> \"I think it is constitutional for the legislature to prohibit same-sex marriage.\" 536 U.S. at 779, 122 S.Ct. 2528. The party affiliation clause prohibits all of this, only more so. It prohibits candidates from announcing their position on one issue of potential importance to voters: the party they support. And it prohibits them from announcing their position on many issues of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*202</span> potential importance to voters: the party platform with which they affiliate. A party platform after all is nothing more than an aggregation of political and legal positions, a shorthand way of announcing one's views on <i>many</i> topics of the day. If the single-issue announce canon at play in <i>White</i> prevented candidates from \"communicating relevant information to voters\" on \"matters of current public importance,\" and did not narrowly advance the State's interest in a non-partisan judiciary, <i>id.</i> at 781-82, 122 S.Ct. 2528, the same is true of Kentucky's canon, which potentially prevents candidates from announcing their views on <i>many</i> issues at once. <i>See id.</i> at 782, 122 S.Ct. 2528 (\"We have never allowed the government to prohibit candidates from communicating relevant information to voters during an election.\").</p>\n<p>At the same time, the canon does too little to advance the State's interest in impartiality and the avoidance of partisan influence. Party affiliation, as it turns out, is not a forbidden topic. It is forbidden only when the candidate raises the point. If, by contrast, a voter asks the question in a one-on-one setting or in a small gathering, the candidate is free to say what she wants. That reality undermines the suggestion that a candidate deals a fatal blow to judicial impartiality by revealing her party affiliations. And of course, once that information is disclosed, whether in answer to a question or based on prior publicly known affiliations (including holding other elected offices), nothing in the canon prohibits <i>others,</i> whether newspapers or political parties or interest groups, from disclosing to the world the candidate's party affiliation. \"A law cannot be regarded as protecting an interest of the highest order, and thus as justifying a restriction upon truthful speech, when it leaves appreciable damage to that supposedly vital interest unprohibited.\" <i>Id.</i> at 780, 122 S.Ct. 2528.</p>\n<p>The clause undershoots its target in another respect. Although candidates may not reveal their party affiliation, they may discuss their membership in, affiliation with or support of any other type of organization, including organizations that take positions on judges and judicial philosophy. Although the two major political parties take positions on a wide array of issues, many interest groups advance a narrower set of positions and often do so more vocally, particularly with respect to judges. By identifying themselves with such groups, candidates can communicate more about their political and judicial convictions than they ever could by carrying a party membership cardand, in the process, may do as much to call judicial open-mindedness into question as any party affiliation ever would.</p>\n<p>The canon also prohibits only <i>disclosure</i> of a candidate's party membership, not party membership itself. Yet the appearance of judicial closed-mindedness is part and parcel of its reality, not a device designed to disguise reality. If concern over judicial partisanship and the influence of political parties on judging truly underlies the clause, the authorization to belong (secretly) to a political party amounts to a gaping omission. A party's undisclosed potential influence on candidates is far worse than its disclosed influence, as the one allows a full airing of the issue before the voters while the other helps to shield it from public view.</p>\n<p>Kentucky responds that the restriction supports the Kentucky Constitution's requirement that judicial elections be nonpartisanthat they operate with no partisan primaries and with no partisan identifiers at the ballot booth. <i>See</i> Ky. Const. § 117; Ky.Rev.Stat. § 118A.060. The point, however, cuts both ways. In one sense, it establishes the bona fides of the Commonwealth's policy. But in another <span class=\"star-pagination\">*203</span> sense, it undermines the Commonwealth's professed need to suppress speech in the process. Carey does not challenge the validity of prohibiting party identifiers on the ballot or the validity of holding non-partisan primaries. He just wishes to communicate about a matter of potential interest to the voters and one that is often already a point of public knowledgeparty affiliationon his own terms.</p>\n<p>Most States have not made the choice Kentucky did. Fifteen States choose their Supreme Court justices in contested, \"nonpartisan\" elections, and only five, including Kentucky, prohibit candidates in those elections from revealing their partisan affiliations. <i>See App'x A.</i> (Three more prohibit candidates from claiming to be \"a candidate of a political organization\" but do not prohibit revealing membership or affiliation. <i>Id.</i>) And two of these five canonsthis one and Wisconsin'shave been invalidated. <i>See </i><i>Siefert,</i> 608 F.3d at 983. That a majority of the States with nonpartisan Supreme Court elections have opted not to censor their candidates in this way of course does not establish the invalidity of the clause, but it does call into question the necessity of implementing Kentucky's nonpartisan judicial election system in this way and whether it amounts to the \"least restrictive means\" of protecting the Commonwealth's interests. <i>Playboy Entm't Group,</i> 529 U.S. at 813, 120 S.Ct. 1878.</p>\n<p>The Commission says that the clause restricts as little speech as possible while preventing Kentucky's elections from turning into ultra-partisan affairs. It allows judges, the Commission adds, to join political parties, to participate in them and to disclose party affiliation if asked in the proper settingallowing voters who care about a candidate's partisan affiliation to discover it while preventing widespread advertisement of a candidate's party membership and preventing \"judicial races [from] turning into partisan political campaigns.\" Commission's Opening Br. at 66. Yet this argument looks at the problem through the wrong end of the telescope: It merely demonstrates that the clause does not restrict as much speech as it might, not that the clause restricts no more speech than is necessary.</p>\n<p>We do not doubt one of the premises of the canonthat party affiliation may not be a reliable indicator of the qualities that make a good judge. Yet \"[i]t is simply not the function of government to select which issues are worth discussing or debating in the course of a political campaign,\" <i>White,</i> 536 U.S. at 782, 122 S.Ct. 2528 (quotation omitted), and it is difficult to see how Kentucky's speech restriction does not do just that. Informational bans premised on the fear that voters cannot handle the disclosure have a long history of being legislatively tried and judicially struck, whether in the election setting or elsewhere. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Brown,</i> 456 U.S. at 60, 102 S.Ct. 1523 (\"The State's fear that voters might make an ill-advised choice does not provide the State with a compelling justification for limiting speech.\"); <i>Va. State Bd. of Pharmacy v. Va. Citizens Consumer Council, Inc.,</i> 425 U.S. 748, 773, 96 S.Ct. 1817, 48 L.Ed.2d 346 (1976). Voters often resort to a variety of proxies in selecting judges and other office holders, some good, some bad. And while political identification may be an unhelpful way to pick judges, it assuredly beats other grounds, such as the all-too-familiar formula of running candidates with familiar or popular last names. In that respect, this informational ban increases the likelihood that one of the least relevant grounds for judicial selectionthe fortuity of one's surnameis all that the voters will have to go on. As the district court correctly concluded, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*204</span> this clause violates the First Amendment on its face.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B.</h2>\n<p><i>Solicitation clause.</i> Kentucky prohibits judicial candidates from \"solicit[ing] campaign funds,\" a restriction that extends to all fundraising by the candidate, including in-person solicitations, group solicitations, telephone calls and letters. Rules of Supreme Court of Kentucky 4.300, Canon 5(B)(2). The clause permits the candidate to establish a committee that may solicit campaign donations, and it permits the committee to disclose to the candidate the names of people who donated to the campaign and those who declined. <i>See id.</i> Kentucky says that the clause satisfies the First Amendment, but we, like the district court, conclude that it does not.</p>\n<p>As with the party affiliation clause, we do not doubt the bona fides of the solicitation clause: that it serves Kentucky's compelling interest in an impartial judiciary. The same goes for its interest in preserving the appearance and reality of a non-corrupt judiciary, an objective often served by fundraising limitations. <i>See </i><i>Fed. Election Comm'n v. Nat'l Conservative Political Action Comm.,</i> 470 U.S. 480, 496-97, 105 S.Ct. 1459, 84 L.Ed.2d 455 (1985). Litigants have a due process right to a trial before a judge with no \"direct, personal, substantial pecuniary interest\" in the outcome, <i>Tumey v. Ohio,</i> 273 U.S. 510, 523, 47 S.Ct. 437, 71 L.Ed. 749 (1927), and the legitimacy of the judiciary rests on delivering on that promise and in furthering the public's trust in the integrity of its judges, <i>see </i><i>Mistretta v. United States,</i> 488 U.S. 361, 407, 109 S.Ct. 647, 102 L.Ed.2d 714 (1989). <i>See generally </i><i>Caperton,</i> 129 S.Ct. 2252.</p>\n<p>Preserving these interests, we also acknowledge, grows more complicated when a State exercises its sovereign right to select judges through popular elections. Judicial elections, like most elections, require moneyoften a lot of it. Kentucky's 2006 Supreme Court election, which featured four contested races and one uncontested race, saw ten candidates raise a total of $2,119,871, of which the candidates spent $772,563 on 2,357 television commercials. Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of Law, <i>The New Politics of Judicial Elections 2006</i> at 3, 16. \"Unless the pool of judicial candidates is limited to those wealthy enough to independently fund their campaigns, a limitation unrelated to judicial skill, the cost of campaigning requires judicial candidates to engage in fundraising.\" <i>White,</i> 536 U.S. at 789-90, 122 S.Ct. 2528 (O'Connor, J., concurring). Complicating matters further, the general public often, though not invariably, pays less attention to judicial elections than other elections, forcing judicial candidates to focus their fundraising efforts on the segment of the population most likely to have an interest in judicial races: the bar. \"This leads to the unseemly situation in which judges preside over cases in which the parties are represented by counsel who have contributed in varying amounts to the judicial campaigns.\" <i>Stretton,</i> 944 F.2d at 145.</p>\n<p>That the clause advances important government interests, however, does not establish that it does so narrowly. Prohibiting candidates from asking for money suppresses speech in the most conspicuous of ways and, in the process, favors some candidates over othersincumbent judges (who benefit from their current status) over non-judicial candidates, the well-to-do (who may not need to raise any money at all) over lower-income candidates, and the well-connected (who have an army of potential fundraisers) over outsiders. For these reasons, it is tempting to say that <i>any</i> limitation on <span class=\"star-pagination\">*205</span> a candidate's right to ask for a campaign contribution is one limitation too many. But there are at least two areas covered by the clause that test such an interpretationface-to-face solicitations, particularly by sitting judges, and solicitations of individuals with cases pending in front of the court. Yet we need not decide the validity of such restrictions today because Kentucky goes well beyond them.</p>\n<p>Besides covering in-person solicitations and those directed at individuals with pending cases, the canon prohibits a range of other solicitations, including speeches to large groups and signed mass mailings. Such indirect methods of solicitation present little or no risk of undue pressure or the appearance of a quid pro quo. No one could reasonably believe that a failure to respond to a signed mass mailing asking for donations would result in unfair treatment in future dealings with the judge. Nor would a speech requesting donations from a large gathering have a \"coercive effect\" on reasonable attendees. Commission's Opening Br. at 55; <i>compare </i><i>Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Ass'n,</i> 436 U.S. 447, 465-66, 98 S.Ct. 1912, 56 L.Ed.2d 444 (1978) (State may regulate lawyers' in-person for-profit solicitation of clients because of \"intrusive[ness]\" of \"persuasion under circumstances conducive to uninformed acquiescence\") <i>with </i><i>In re Primus,</i> 436 U.S. 412, 435-36, 98 S.Ct. 1893, 56 L.Ed.2d 417 (1978) (regulation of lawyer's written, not-for-profit solicitation merited heightened scrutiny because it did not \"afford any significant opportunity for overreaching or coercion\") <i>and </i><i>Shapero v. Ky. Bar Ass'n,</i> 486 U.S. 466, 475, 108 S.Ct. 1916, 100 L.Ed.2d 475 (1988) (\"Targeted, direct-mail solicitation is distinguishable from the in-person solicitation\" because there is no \"badgering advocate breathing down [a potential client's] neck,\" asking for \"an immediate yes-or-no answer.\").</p>\n<p>At the same time, the clause does too little to protect the Commonwealth's interests. Although the candidate himself may not solicit donations, his campaign committee may. And nothing prevents a committee member from soliciting donations in person. That leaves a rule preventing a candidate from sending a signed mass mailing to every voter in the district but permitting the candidate's best friend to ask for a donation directly from an attorney who frequently practices before the court. Are not the risks of coercion and undue appearance far less with the first (prohibited) solicitation than the second (permitted) one?</p>\n<p>Although the clause prevents judicial candidates from saying \"please, give me a donation,\" it does not prevent them from saying \"thank you\" for a donation given. The clause bars any solicitation, whether in a large group or small one, whether by letter or one on one, but it does not bar the candidate from learning how individuals responded to the committee's solicitations. That omission suggests that the only interest at play is the impolitic interpersonal dynamics of a candidate's request for money, not the more corrosive reality of who gives and how much. If the purported risk addressed by the clause is that the judge or candidate will treat donors and non-donors differently, it is knowing who contributed and who balked that makes the difference, not who asked for the contribution. If Kentucky fears that judges will allow campaign donations to affect their rulings, it must believe that \"[s]uccessful candidates will feel beholden to the people who helped them get elected regardless of who did the soliciting of support.\" <i>Weaver,</i> 309 F.3d at 1323.</p>\n<p>Two other circuits have considered the validity of similar canons and have come to similar conclusions. In <i>Weaver,</i> the Eleventh Circuit considered a Georgia rule providing <span class=\"star-pagination\">*206</span> that judicial candidates \"shall not themselves solicit campaign funds.\" 309 F.3d at 1315. Relying on many of the same means-end problems identified here, the court concluded that the canon was \"not narrowly tailored to serve Georgia's compelling interest in judicial impartiality.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1322. In <i>White II,</i> on remand after the Supreme Court invalidated Minnesota's \"announce\" clause, the Eighth Circuit invalidated a canon that prohibited judicial candidates from \"personally solicit[ing] or accept[ing] campaign contributions.\" 416 F.3d at 745. In <i>Siefert,</i> 608 F.3d 974, the Seventh Circuit upheld Wisconsin's prohibition on judges' \"personal[ ] solicit[ation]\" of campaign contributions. <i>See</i> 608 F.3d at 990. But, in doing so, it focused on the problems associated with \"direct\" solicitation and did not consider the validity of applying the canon to mass mailings and group solicitationsthe most troubling scenarios here. <i>See id.</i> at 989-90.</p>\n<p>The state defendants push back, arguing that, even though a candidate may discover her donors' identities from the campaign committee, the solicitation clause makes \"favoritism\" toward contributors \"more difficult.\" Commission's Opening Br. at 57. After all, they reason, when a candidate asks for a donation in person, she immediately will find out whether the donor gives and how much. <i>Id.</i> That may or may not be true. But even if we grant the Commonwealth's premisethat in-person solicitations always lead to more immediate information about donations or rejectionsthat suggests only that the solicitation clause may be constitutional in some settings. It does not resolve the clause's considerable overbreadth: its application to mass-mailing solicitations or speeches to a large audience.</p>\n<p>But the solicitation clause must be constitutional, the state defendants add, because most other States with judicial elections also prevent candidates from soliciting funds. <i>See</i> Commission's Opening Br. at 53. The argument is not as helpful as they suggest. By our count, twenty-two States currently elect judges to their highest courts in contested elections. (States with retention elections are less relevant because by definition they do not involve two candidates competing for the same seat.) Of these twenty-two States, thirteen, including Kentucky, prohibit candidates from soliciting campaign contributions. <i>See App'x B.</i> (Two more have hortatory canons telling candidates they \"should not\" or are \"strongly discouraged\" from personally soliciting. <i>Id.</i>) Yet this bare majority is no more dispositive here than it was in <i>White,</i> where twenty-six States had some form of announce clause. <i>See </i><i>White,</i> 536 U.S. at 786, 122 S.Ct. 2528. No less importantly, we do not decide today whether a State <i>could</i> enact a narrowly tailored solicitation clausesay, one focused on one-on-one solicitations or solicitations from individuals with cases pending before the courtonly that this clause does not do so narrowly.</p>\n<p>The Commonwealth to its credit wishes to avoid cases like <i>Simes v. Ark. Judicial Discipline &amp; Disability Comm'n,</i> 368 Ark. 577, 247 S.W.3d 876 (2007), where a judge \"made direct, personal solicitations\" to attorneys who \"had cases currently pending in the judge's court.\" <i>Id.</i> at 880. But Kentucky's clause goes well beyond these sorts of solicitations. Kentucky has chosen to elect its judges in competitive elections and must abide by some of the risks that go with that decision. <i>See </i><i>White,</i> 536 U.S. at 792, 122 S.Ct. 2528 (O'Connor, J., concurring). While we do not question Kentucky's right to select judges through popular elections, the Commonwealth cannot exempt itself from the demands of the First Amendment in the process. <i>See id.</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*207</span> at 788, 122 S.Ct. 2528 (majority); <i>Geary v. Renne,</i> 911 F.2d 280, 294 (9th Cir.1990) (en banc) (Reinhardt, J., concurring) (\"The State ... cannot have it both ways. If it wants to elect its judges, it cannot deprive its citizens of a full and robust election debate.\"), <i>vacated on other grounds by </i><i>Renne v. Geary,</i> 501 U.S. 312, 111 S.Ct. 2331, 115 L.Ed.2d 288 (1991). The solicitation clause is overbroad and thus invalid on its face.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C.</h2>\n<p><i>The commits clause.</i> In prohibiting judicial candidates from \"intentionally or recklessly mak[ing] a statement that a reasonable person would perceive as committing a judge or candidate to rule a certain way in a case, controversy, or issue that is likely to come before the court,\" Canon 5(B)(1)(c), the commits clause covers a range of campaign statements. Some of those restrictions are legitimate. Others may not be. And there is a \"vast middle ground of uncertainty\" between the two. <i>Outlaw v. Airtech Air Conditioning &amp; Heating, Inc.,</i> 412 F.3d 156, 161 (D.C.Cir. 2005) (Roberts, J.).</p>\n<p>In what seems to be its core sense, the clause, found in one form or another in 39 States, <i>see App'x C,</i> runs the gauntlet of strict scrutiny. By preventing candidates from making \"statement[s]\" that \"commit[ ]\" them \"to rule a certain way in a case [or] controversy,\" the clause secures a basic objective of the judiciary, one so basic that due process requires it: that litigants have a right to air their disputes before judges who have not committed to rule against them before the opening brief is read. <i>See </i><i>Caperton,</i> 129 S.Ct. at 2266-67; <i>Bracy v. Gramley,</i> 520 U.S. 899, 904-05, 117 S.Ct. 1793, 138 L.Ed.2d 97 (1997). Whatever else a fair adjudication requires, it demands that judges decide cases based on the law and facts before them, not based on \"express ... commitments that they may have made to their campaign supporters.\" <i>Buckley v. Ill. Judicial Inquiry Bd.,</i> 997 F.2d 224, 227 (7th Cir.1993). No one, Carey included, disputes that the Commonwealth has a compelling interest in \"prohibit[ing] candidates from promising to rule a certain way on cases.\" Carey's Opening Br. at 14-15.</p>\n<p>Nor does Carey dispute that the clause narrowly advances this interestif, that is, the clause is confined to campaign \"commitments\" with respect to \"cases\" or \"controversies.\" So limited, the clause targets the kinds of interests <i>White</i> suggests the States may protect, as judicial commitments with respect to cases and controversies implicate not just a lack of open mindedness about the law but a lack of impartiality in its most essential sensea commitment to rule for one <i>party</i> over another. <i>See </i><i>White,</i> 536 U.S. at 775-76, 122 S.Ct. 2528 (\"[I]mpartiality\" in \"the traditional sense\" means \"apply[ing] the law to [one party] in the same way [one] applies it to any other party.\"). The First Amendment permits a State to limit speech when the Due Process Clause demands nothing less.</p>\n<p>But the canon does not stop there. It also prevents candidates from making commitments about \"issues.\" A commitment to rule a certain way on \"issues likely to come before the court\" covers a raft of electioneering stands, and it unmoors the prohibition from \"cases\" or \"controversies\" and the party-specific connotations that come with those terms. As <i>White</i> reminds us, \"there is almost no legal or political <i>issue</i> that is unlikely to come before a judge of an American court, state or federal, of general jurisdiction.\" <i>White,</i> 536 U.S. at 772, 122 S.Ct. 2528 (emphasis added and quotation omitted). To make matters worse, the commentary to the clause says that it covers the \"appearance\" of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*208</span> making \"issue\"-related commitments. Canon 5(B)(1)(c), Cmt.</p>\n<p>Think back to <i>White.</i> How is a judicial candidate's \"announcement\" of a position on a legal \"issue\" during an election campaign not likely to create the \"appearance\" that the candidate has \"committed\" to \"rule a certain way\" on the \"issue\"? And, if that is so, how can this aspect of the canon survive <i>White,</i> given that it seems to ban what <i>White</i> permits? These are good questions, but they prompt an even more basic one: what exactly does the \"issues\" prohibition cover?</p>\n<p>The clause contains a serious level-of-generality problem. At the broadest level of meaning, it would seem to cover issue-related promises like these: \"I commit to follow <i>stare decisis</i>\"; \"I commit to follow an originalist theory of constitutional interpretation\" or for that matter \"a living constitutionalist theory\"; \"I commit to a purposive method of statutory interpretation\" or for that matter a \"textual\" one; \"I commit to use (or not to use) legislative history\"; or \"I commit to be a rule-of-law judge.\" One might reasonably say that the clause covers all of these statements, as they all relate to \"issues\" likely to come before a court and they all create an \"appearance\" of commitment. Yet if that is what the clause means, it is hard to square with the Constitution. A restriction on such promises does nothing to prevent the kind of \"impartiality\" that the States have an interest in securingdefined as bias (or the appearance of bias) toward particular parties or cases. <i>See </i><i>White,</i> 536 U.S. at 776-77, 122 S.Ct. 2528.</p>\n<p>In a narrower sense, however, the \"issues\" prohibition may serve that interest. In <i>White</i> itself, the Court contemplated that a State could prevent a candidate from highlighting an \"unbroken record of affirming convictions for rape\" because such statements would \"exhibit a bias against parties,\" namely against these types of criminal defendants and in favor of the prosecutor in these types of appeals. 536 U.S. at 777 n. 7, 122 S.Ct. 2528; <i>id.</i> at 800-01, 122 S.Ct. 2528 (Stevens, J., dissenting). An interpretation of the clause confined to these kinds of statements thus might advance a compelling state interest and do so narrowly.</p>\n<p>In a facial challenge like this one, the ultimate question is one of overbreadth: Does the law \"prohibit[] a substantial amount of protected speech both in an absolute sense and relative to [the canons'] plainly legitimate sweep\"? <i>Connection Distrib. Co.,</i> 557 F.3d at 336 (internal quotations omitted). To determine the extent of a law's illegitimate reach, one needs to know what it means, as \"it is impossible to determine whether a statute reaches too far without first knowing what the statute covers.\" <i>United States v. Williams,</i> 553 U.S. 285, 293, 128 S.Ct. 1830, 170 L.Ed.2d 650 (2008).</p>\n<p>That inquiry has not happened hereat least with respect to the \"issues\" prohibition. In upholding this clause, the district court focused on its application to \"cases\" and \"controversies\" and, to that extent, we agree with its analysis for the reasons noted. But the district court did not explore the clause's applicability to \"issues,\" the array of settings in which that part of the clause and commentary may apply and the tension of several of them with <i>White.</i> At oral argument, we asked the parties about the point. Carey agreed that the commits clause would satisfy the First Amendment if the clause did not contain an \"issues\" component to it, and saw the addition of the \"issues\" language (together with the commentary) as having two impermissible effects: chilling candidates' free-speech rights to discuss their legal philosophies freely, and effectively sidestepping <i>White</i> by prohibiting candidates <span class=\"star-pagination\">*209</span> from announcing their positions on legal issues. The state defendants suggested that a narrowing construction of the \"issues\" clause could save it.</p>\n<p>Under these circumstances, discretion, to say nothing of respect for a co-equal sovereign, is the better part of valor. At this point it is not clear what the Commonwealth's position on the term is, and the district court has not yet explored these issues. If we remand this aspect of the case to the district court, the court will have that chance. So too will the partiesparticularly the state defendants, who retain considerable authority over shaping the clause and the commentary that goes with it. The state defendants may be able to obtain authority to remove the \"issues\" language; they may be able to identify an acceptable narrowing construction of the \"issues\" language along with a modification to the commentary; or they may suggest certification to the Kentucky Supreme Court. Any of these options may spare the federal courts the task of resolving a difficult constitutional question, and at a minimum they will give the Commonwealth a first shot at addressing the question.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>There is room for debate about whether the election of state court judges is a good idea or a bad one. Yet there is no room for debate that, if a State opts to select its judges through popular elections, it must comply with the First Amendment in doing so. In this case, we have upheld some components of Kentucky's Code of Judicial Conduct, invalidated others and sought clarification of still one other provision. Through it all, no one should lose sight of the reality that a judicial candidate's right to engage in certain types of speech says nothing about the desirability of that speech. The First Amendment protects the meek and brazen, the \"offensive\" and agreeable. <i>Texas v. Johnson,</i> 491 U.S. 397, 414, 109 S.Ct. 2533, 105 L.Ed.2d 342 (1989). Today's case is about the meaning of the First Amendment, not about the virtues of some types of judicial campaign speech relative to others.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>V.</h2>\n<p>For these reasons, we affirm the district court's judgment as to the party affiliation and solicitation clauses and vacate its judgment as to the commits clause and remand the case for further consideration of the meaning and validity of that clause.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>APPENDIX A</h2>\n<p></p>\n<pre>\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nState                   Party Affiliation Clause\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nKentucky                \"A judge or candidate shall not identify himself or herself as a member\n                        of a political party in any form of advertising, or when speaking to a\n                        gathering.\" Ky.Code of Jud.

I would go further and affirm the District Court in upholding the entire commits clause, including the issues portion. The majority's concern with an overly broad interpretation of what constitutes a commitment to vote a certain way or bias toward a party based on campaign promises regarding an \"issue,\" amounts to the construction of a straw man. I believe a candidate for judge knows exactly when she is making a commitment, or giving the appearance of such a commitment. I believe the same is true of the enforcer of the canons. Is there any doubt about commitment when a candidate professes to believe that life begins at conception? Is there any committed bias in favor of a potential party when a candidate for judge states a \"strong belief in the right to keep and bear arms?\" Maybe the definition of <i>White-permitted</i> issue commitments is like the definition of pornography. Anyone with common sense knows the portent of a campaign commitment when he hears it. Yet by remand we are asking the District Court to do what the Supreme Court could not do in <i>White</i> and we are unable to do here.</p>\n<p>Maintenance of public confidence that a litigant will receive an unbiased hearing in the courts is as compelling an interest as any possessed by the Commonwealth of Kentucky. The canon here appropriately addresses that interest. Definitional disagreements, if they arise, can be addressed when they arise.</p>\n<p>I respectfully dissent from the holding of the majority vacating the District Court in respect to the commits clause.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  The Honorable Thomas A.

A court faced with a First (and Fourteenth) Amendment challenge to the law would make short work of it.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">732</span></a></span> (1982). It is doubtful that a single federal or state court judge in the country would see it differently.</p>\n<p>Yet what happens if the same restrictions apply to judicial elections, not legislative elections? Some say the answer is the same. Elections are elections, and the same First Amendment applies to all of them. When the government suppresses election speech based on its contentprohibiting candidates from mentioning a political party with whom they affiliate, barring them from putting their name on a fund-raising letter or telling them what they can and cannot say about their judicial philosophythe most rigorous form of constitutional second-guessing applies, and no categorical exemption from the First Amendment spares the government from this burden. In modern America, judicial elections are no less relevant to the public policy concerns of the citizenry than legislative elections, and the First Amendment protects electioneering speech in the one context as vigorously as it does in the other. Concerns about impartiality and open-mindedness that might result from unfettered judicial campaigning can be handled after the elections, not before, through the application of case-by-case judicial recusal rules that all States require their judges to follow before they agree to hear a case. Any remaining concerns flow not from the absence of speech restrictions on judicial candidates but from the State's insistence on holding elections for judicial office in the first place. A State cannot simultaneously insist that judges be held accountable to the electorate at regular intervals but deny to sitting judges and candidates alike the communicative tools for explaining how they will be held to account.</p>\n<p>Others say it is not that easy. Judges do not represent constituents. They apply the law to the facts one case at a time, and, if they represent anyone or anything, it is the rule of law, which is why they sometimes must rule <i>against</i> the policy preferences of a majority of the voters. The judicial process works only when it is done in a disinterested manner, which is inconsistent with campaigns in which judges commit to rule, or appear to commit to rule, in a certain way in certain cases. It <span class=\"star-pagination\">*194</span> is one thing when a legislator solicits money during a campaign; it is quite another when a judicial candidate, a sitting judge above all, does the same. With a few modest exceptions, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co.,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145867\"><a href=\"/opinion/145867/caperton-v-at-massey-coal-co-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1208</span></a></span> (2009); Mich. Court Rule 2.003, judicial-recusal rules are self-enforced and therefore may not provide adequate safeguards against the risks that flow from treating judicial elections like legislative ones. Unlike the other branches of government, the authority of the judiciary turns almost exclusively on its credibility and the respect warranted by its rulings, both of which are likely to be diminished by free-flowing electoral speech that permits the malignant inference that there is such a thing as caucus-bound blue-robed judges and caucus-bound red-robed judges. In some settings, there can be too much of a good thing, and unfettered free speech in judicial elections is one of them.</p>\n<p>This is a complicated debate, and today's case requires us to take a side on some of these issues. Most recently in 2005, the Kentucky Supreme Court promulgated a judicial canon along the lines of the hypothetical legislative campaign rules mentioned above. As sitting judges ourselves, we have considerable sympathy for the concerns that prompted the canon, so much so that we embrace a central premise of it: Judicial elections differ from legislative elections, and the Kentucky Supreme Court has a compelling interest in regulating judicial campaign speech to ensure the reality and appearance of an impartial judiciary. Yet because two clauses of the canon overlooked narrower ways of advancing this interest and because, as written, they remain incompatible with the United States Supreme Court's decision in <i>Republican Party of Minnesota v. White,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121170\"><a href=\"/opinion/121170/republican-party-of-minn-v-white/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">765</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121170\"><a href=\"/opinion/121170/republican-party-of-minn-v-white/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The third clause is constitutional in the main but contains a material ambiguity, which requires further consideration by the district court. The district court's decision is affirmed in part and vacated in part.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A.</h2>\n<p>In 1792, Kentucky became the fifteenth State (and the fourth Commonwealth). The original Kentucky Constitution permitted the Governor to appoint judges, <i>see</i> Ky. Const. art. 2, § 8 (1792), but the Commonwealth, in the aftermath of the Age of Jackson, amended its Constitution in 1850 to require its judges to stand for popular election to eight-year terms. <i>See</i> Ky. Const. § 117; Ky. Const. art. 4, §§ 4, 6 (1850). Since 1975, judicial elections in Kentucky have been \"nonpartisan,\" <i>compare</i> Ky. Const. § 116 (1891) <i>with</i> Ky. Const. § 117 (1976), meaning that political parties have no formal role in any stage of the judicial selection process. Prospective candidates submit petitions for nomination to the Secretary of State. Ky.Rev.Stat. Ann. § 118A.060. The Commonwealth holds a single primary election for each judicial seat with no party identifiers and random ballot positioning. <i>Id.</i> The top two vote-getters in the primary election receive a spot on the general election ballot, which also is held without any party identifier. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>In competing for judicial seats, all candidates must abide by the Kentucky Code of Judicial Conduct. Promulgated by the Kentucky Supreme Court, it generally prohibits \"a judge or judicial candidate\" from \"inappropriate political activity.\" Rules of Supreme Court of Kentucky 3.130(8.2); 4.300, Canon 5. Sitting judges or judicial candidates violate this admonition, the Code says, if they fail to follow these clauses of Canon 5, among others:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*195</span> <i>The party affiliation clause.</i> \"A judge or candidate shall not identify himself or herself as a member of a political party in any form of advertising, or when speaking to a gathering. If not initiated by the judge or candidate for such office, and only in answer to a direct question, the judge or candidate may identify himself or herself as a member of a particular political party.\" Canon 5(A)(2).</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<i>The solicitation clause.</i> \"A judge or a candidate for judicial office shall not solicit campaign funds, but may establish committees of responsible persons to secure and manage the expenditure of funds for the campaign and to obtain public statements of support for the candidacy.\" Canon 5(B)(2).</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<i>The commits clause.</i> \"A judge or candidate for election to judicial office ... shall not intentionally or recklessly make a statement that a reasonable person would perceive as committing the judge or candidate to rule a certain way in a case, controversy, or issue that is likely to come before the court....\" Canon 5(B)(1)(c).</blockquote>\n<p>The Kentucky Judicial Conduct Commission, a constitutionally mandated state body subject to judicial review by the Kentucky Supreme Court, <i>see</i> Ky. Const. § 121, enforces the Code of Judicial Conduct. It may impose sanctions on violators of the Code, which run the gamut from a private reprimand to a public censure to removal from office to a referral to the Kentucky Bar Association for disbarment from the practice of law. Rules of Supreme Court of Kentucky 4.020. The Kentucky Inquiry Commission and the Office of Bar Counsel also police ethical violations by Kentucky attorneys, including violations of the rule that \"[a] lawyer who is a candidate for judicial office shall comply with the applicable provisions of the Code of Judicial Conduct.\" Rules of Supreme Court of Kentucky 3.130(8.2); 3.160(1).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B.</h2>\n<p>In June 2006, Marcus Carey, then a candidate for a seat on the Kentucky Supreme Court, filed a complaint in federal district court claiming that the party affiliation, solicitation and commits clauses violated his speech and associational rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution. The named defendants sit on the Kentucky Judicial Conduct Commission, sit on the Kentucky Inquiry Commission or serve as Bar Counsel.</p>\n<p>Carey complained that he wanted to disclose his party status, yet he feared the party affiliation clause barred him from doing so. He wanted to ask for campaign contributions by signing fund-raising letters, yet he feared the solicitation clause barred him from doing so. And he wished to respond to a judicial questionnaire distributed by Kentucky Right to Life, raising questions for the candidates about their judicial philosophy and about their positions on specific issues, yet he feared the commits clause barred him from doing so. He asked the court to declare the clauses unconstitutional on their face and to enjoin their enforcement.</p>\n<p>In October 2006, roughly one month before the election, the district court preliminarily enjoined enforcement of the party affiliation and the solicitation clauses but dismissed Carey's challenge to the commits clause on ripeness and standing grounds. On November 2, Carey moved to amend his complaint, re-challenging the commits clause, this time detailing the statements he proposed to make in possible violation of the clause. About a week later, Carey lost the election.</p>\n<p>In September 2007, the court ruled that Carey's amended challenge to the commits <span class=\"star-pagination\">*196</span> clause was ripe for review and allowed it to proceed along with Carey's challenges to the party affiliation and solicitation clauses. The parties all moved for summary judgment. In ruling on the motions, the district court determined that strict scrutiny applied to all of the challenges. It then invalidated the party affiliation and solicitation clauses on their face but rejected Carey's facial challenge to the commits clause. The state defendants appeal the court's ruling on the party affiliation and solicitation clauses, and Carey appeals the court's ruling on the commits clause.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>Before turning to the merits, we must consider two jurisdictional questions implicated by these challenges: Did Carey file his claims too early, making them unripe for judicial review, or too late, making them moot? <i>See </i><i>Warshak v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1425282\"><a href=\"/opinion/1425282/warshak-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">532</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">521</span></a></span>, 525 (6th Cir.2008) (en banc).</p>\n<p><i>Ripeness.</i> Designed to ensure that the federal courts resolve \"existing, substantial controversies,\" <i>Norton v.

Magaw,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"749810\"><a href=\"/opinion/749810/national-rifle-association-of-america-a-new-york-not-for-profit/\"><span class=\"volume\">132</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">272</span></a></span>, 284 (6th Cir.1997), the ripeness doctrine ensures that a dispute is concrete and real before the judicial branch resolves it. Three considerations inform the doctrine: Is the alleged injury likely to occur? Is the factual record sufficiently developed to resolve the question? And what kinds of hardships, if any, will the parties face if the court delays resolution of the question? <i>Warshak,</i> 532 F.3d at 525. In the context of a free-speech overbreadth challenge like this one, a relaxed ripeness standard applies to steer clear of the risk that the law \"may cause others not before the court to refrain from constitutionally protected speech or expression.\" <i>Broadrick v. Oklahoma,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108858\"><a href=\"/opinion/108858/broadrick-v-oklahoma/\"><span class=\"volume\">413</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">601</span></a></span>, 612, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108858\"><a href=\"/opinion/108858/broadrick-v-oklahoma/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">830</span></a></span> (1973).</p>\n<p>Carey meets these requirements. In future judicial elections, as in prior ones, he claims an interest in engaging in protected speech that implicates, if not violates, each clause. He wants to let voters know his party affiliation. He wants to solicit campaign funds directly, as opposed to indirectly via an election committee. And he wants to answer judicial questionnaires propounded by a local right-to-life organization. These aspects of the canon at least chill, and in some instances prohibit, these forms of communication, and in the course of the November 2006 election, at least until the entry of the October 2006 injunction, Carey censored himself on each topic. All of this establishes a \"credible fear of enforcement,\" <i>Norton,</i> 298 F.3d at 554, sufficient to overcome any ripeness concerns.</p>\n<p>The Kentucky Judicial Conduct Commission persists that the Kentucky Supreme Court and its ethics branch, the Kentucky Judicial Ethics Committee, have yet to apply these clauses to Carey, noting that \"an authoritative construction of the canons may significantly alter the constitutional questions.\" Commission's Opening Br. at 22. That is all true, but it is a peculiar ground for staying our hand now with respect to <i>all</i> of these challenges, some of which involve clauses with little ambiguity. <i>See </i><i>City of Lakewood v. Plain Dealer Pub. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112103\"><a href=\"/opinion/112103/city-of-lakewood-v-plain-dealer-publishing-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">486</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">750</span></a></span>, 770 n. 11, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112103\"><a href=\"/opinion/112103/city-of-lakewood-v-plain-dealer-publishing-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">771</span></a></span> (1988). This challenge dates from July 2006, and a related challenge, supported by the same counsel, dates from September 2004, <i>see </i><i>Family Trust Found. of Ky., Inc. v. Wolnitzek,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2572929\"><a href=\"/opinion/2572929/family-trust-foundation-of-kentucky-inc-v-wolnitzek/\"><span class=\"volume\">345</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">672</span></a></span> (E.D.Ky.2004). The Commission has had ample time to request interpretations or modifications of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*197</span> Canon 5 by the Committee or the Court, yet apparently has not done so. Nor has the Commission, or anyone else in this case, asked the federal courts to certify any questions to the Kentucky Supreme Court. These claims are ripe for review.</p>\n<p><i>Mootness.</i> In one sense, Carey's original challenge seems moot because the November 2006 election has come and gone. Carey filed his original complaint months ahead of the election, and moved to amend it a week before the election, yet here we are more than three years after the election, still considering his claims. Carey, however, retains the right to run for judicial office again, and all candidates for judicial office in Kentucky, whether sitting judges or not, are subject to Canon 5. Under these circumstances, the claims may proceed: The alleged wrongs are \"capable of repetition, yet evading review,\" saving them from mootness, as the district court correctly held and as the parties do not dispute. <i>See </i><i>Fed.

At issue in <i>White</i> was a judicial canon, first promulgated by Minnesota in 1974, providing that \"a candidate for a judicial office, including an incumbent judge,\" shall not \"announce his or her views on disputed legal or political issues.\" Minn.Code of Judicial Conduct, Canon 5(A)(3)(d)(i); <i>White,</i> 536 U.S. at 768, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121170\"><a href=\"/opinion/121170/republican-party-of-minn-v-white/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Applying strict scrutiny, the Court rejected Minnesota's contention that the canon preserved judicial \"impartiality\" in a permissible way.</p>\n<p>To the extent the Minnesota announce clause sought to preserve judicial \"impartiality\" in one sensea \"lack of bias for or against either <i>party</i> to the proceeding,\" <i>id.</i> at 775, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121170\"><a href=\"/opinion/121170/republican-party-of-minn-v-white/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

It may be, the Court acknowledged, that, \"when a case arises that turns on a legal issue on which the judge (as a candidate) had taken a particular stand, the party taking the opposite stand is likely to lose,\" but that is not due to \"any bias against that party\" for \"[<i>a</i>]<i>ny</i> party taking that position is just as likely to lose.\" <i>Id.</i> at 776-77, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121170\"><a href=\"/opinion/121170/republican-party-of-minn-v-white/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

When a high-stakes dispute involving the mining company came before the court, the justice refused to recuse himself from hearing it and ultimately joined the 3-2 majority in ruling for the company. <i>See id.</i> at 2258. The losing party claimed that the justice's participation in the case violated its due process rights. The Supreme Court agreed, holding that, by refusing to disqualify himself, the justice had unconstitutionally deprived the parties of a fair hearing. <i>See id.</i> at 2265. When \"there is a serious risk of actual bias,\" the Court reasoned, the Constitution requires judges to disqualify themselves, though the Court cautioned that this was \"an extraordinary situation,\" emphasizing the size of the mining company's support relative to other donors' support, the apparently decisive effect of this support on the justice's election and the close temporal connection between the justice's election and the company's case. <i>Id.</i> at 2263, 2265.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B.</h2>\n<p>Strict scrutiny applies to all three aspects of this First Amendment challenge. <i>White,</i> for one, suggests as much, even if the decision does not compel that conclusion. In striking down Minnesota's announce clause, the Court said the following about the standard of review:</p>\n<blockquote>As the Court of Appeals recognized, the announce clause both prohibits speech on the basis of its content and burdens a category of speech that is \"at the core of our First Amendment freedoms\"speech about the qualifications of candidates for public office. [<i>Republican Party of Minn. v. Kelly</i><i>,</i>] 247 F.3d [854] at 861, 863 [ (2001) ]. The Court of Appeals concluded that the proper test to be applied to determine the constitutionality of such a restriction is what our cases have called strict scrutiny, <i>id.,</i> at 864; the parties do not dispute that this is correct.</blockquote>\n<p>536 U.S. at 774, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121170\"><a href=\"/opinion/121170/republican-party-of-minn-v-white/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2528</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>The state defendants seize on the modest length of the Court's analysis and Minnesota's concession, arguing that we need not apply strict scrutiny here. But <i>White's</i> brevity on this score and Minnesota's concession may suggest something else: that the counter-argument has little to support it. The multi-State amicus brief filed in support of Minnesota did not question the applicability of strict scrutiny in <i>White. See</i> Brief Amicus Curiae of California, <i>et al.</i> in Support of Respondents, <i>Republican Party of Minn. v. Kelly,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121170\"><a href=\"/opinion/121170/republican-party-of-minn-v-white/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">765</span></a></span> (2002). Not one of the Justices, not even one of the four dissenters, objected to the application of strict scrutiny. And if strict scrutiny does not apply to judicial canons like this one and the one at issue in <i>White,</i> it is difficult to understand why the Court exercised its discretion in reviewing <i>White,</i> given that virtually the entire analysis is premised on the applicability of strict scrutiny and given that the outcome of the case under a lower level of scrutiny is far from clear.</p>\n<p>Free-speech first principles also suggest that strict scrutiny <i>should</i> apply. The three canons censor speech based on its <span class=\"star-pagination\">*199</span> content in the most basic of ways: They prevent candidates from speaking about some subjects (judicial philosophy, the legal issues of the day, party affiliation) but not others (experience); and they prevent candidates from asking for support in some ways (campaign funds) but not others (a vote, yard signs). The canons refer directly to, and are \"justified with[ ] reference to,\" the content of candidates' speech, meaning they are not eligible for the relaxed review that content-neutral restrictions receive. <i>Ward v.

The canons instead are of a piece with the kinds of speech regulationtelling candidates what they can and cannot say before an electionthat the courts have scrutinized most rigorously. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Brown,</i> 456 U.S. at 53-54, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110689\"><a href=\"/opinion/110689/brown-v-hartlage/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

U. L. REV. 331, 347 (2007) (same).</p>\n<p>The Commission does not cite a single case, and we have not found one on our own, applying anything less than strict scrutiny to comparable free-speech challenges to judicial election canons. After <i>White,</i> the Eighth Circuit applied strict scrutiny to Minnesota's party affiliation and solicitation clauses. <i>See </i><i>Republican Party of Minn. v. White,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">416</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">738</span></span>, 749 (8th Cir.2005) (en banc) (<i>\"White II\"</i>). After <i>White,</i> the Eleventh Circuit did the same in invalidating Georgia's rules prohibiting judicial candidates from soliciting campaign funds. <i>See </i><i>Weaver v.

After <i>White,</i> the Seventh Circuit applied strict scrutiny to Wisconsin's party affiliation clause and held that Wisconsin's solicitation clause survived both intermediate and strict scrutiny. <i>See </i><i>Siefert v. Alexander,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"148492\"><a href=\"/opinion/148492/siefert-v-alexander/\"><span class=\"volume\">608</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">974</span></a></span>, 978, 981 (7th Cir.2010). And, before <i>White,</i> the Third Circuit applied <span class=\"star-pagination\">*200</span> strict scrutiny in upholding some judicial speech restrictions. <i>See </i><i>Stretton v. Disciplinary Bd. of Supreme Court of Pa.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"567937\"><a href=\"/opinion/567937/samuel-c-stretton-in-91-1439-v-disciplinary-board-of-the-supreme-court-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">944</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">137</span></a></span>, 141-42 (3d Cir.1991).</p>\n<p>The Commission urges us to apply a form of intermediate scrutiny, which balances the \"competing fundamental rights\" of some judicial candidates (who have a right to engage in campaign speech) and some litigants (who have a right to an impartial judiciary). Commission's Opening Br. at 10. But the reality that judicial impartiality is a \"vital state interest,\" protected by the Due Process Clause, <i>Caperton,</i> 129 S.Ct. at 2266-67, does not require us to dilute the First Amendment. It establishes instead that Kentucky has a compelling interest in preserving the canon, proving that the State can satisfy the first requirement of strict scrutiny, not that, having satisfied this requirement, it may water down the remaining requirements.</p>\n<p>The Commission's analogy to <i>Gentile v. State Bar of Nevada,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112647\"><a href=\"/opinion/112647/gentile-v-state-bar-of-nev/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1030</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112647\"><a href=\"/opinion/112647/gentile-v-state-bar-of-nev/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">888</span></a></span> (1991), does not hold up. <i>Gentile</i> \"balance[d]\" litigants' fair trial rights with attorneys' free speech rights in upholding a rule prohibiting attorneys involved in a pending trial from making statements likely to prejudice the proceedings. <i>Id.</i> at 1075, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112647\"><a href=\"/opinion/112647/gentile-v-state-bar-of-nev/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2720</span></a></span>. As these features of the decision suggest, <i>Gentile</i> applies only to speech restrictions imposed on attorneys during a pending case, <i>see id.</i> at 1073 n. 5, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112647\"><a href=\"/opinion/112647/gentile-v-state-bar-of-nev/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2720</span></a></span>, which is one reasonthere are otherswhy a comparable law restricting judges from telling the press about the outcome of a pending case would not be an unconstitutional prior restraint on speech. Today, however, we have a speech restriction aimed not at judges performing court functions but at judges and judicial candidates making campaign statements or solicitations outside of court and outside of the process of deciding cases in their official capacityall for the purpose of communicating information to voters about whom they should elect. That <i>Gentile</i> upholds a law restricting a lawyer's speech during a trial does not mean that it allows restrictions on lawyers in all settings. Otherwise, a lawyer running to be the Attorney General or Governor of a State could be censored simply because she is an \"officer of the court.\" That is not the case.</p>\n<p>The Commission insists that the solicitation clause is an especially poor candidate for strict scrutiny review, because the Supreme Court applies a \"lesser\" standard of review to restrictions on political donations. <i>See </i><i>McConnell v. Fed. Election Comm'n,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"131149\"><a href=\"/opinion/131149/mcconnell-v-federal-election-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">540</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">93</span></a></span>, 136, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"131149\"><a href=\"/opinion/131149/mcconnell-v-federal-election-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">491</span></a></span> (2003). But this argument gives analogy a bad name. The solicitation clause does not set a contribution limit, as in <i>McConnell</i> and similar cases. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Fed. Election Comm'n v. Nat'l Right to Work Comm.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110819\"><a href=\"/opinion/110819/fec-v-national-right-to-work-committee/\"><span class=\"volume\">459</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">197</span></a></span>, 208, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110819\"><a href=\"/opinion/110819/fec-v-national-right-to-work-committee/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Rules of Supreme Court of Kentucky 4.300, Canon 5(A)(2); Kentucky Judicial Ethics Opinion JE-105 (2004). The clause advances at least two interests, both sufficiently compelling to satisfy the First Amendment. It furthers the Commonwealth's goal of having a judiciary that is biased neither in fact nor in appearance. <i>See </i><i>White,</i> 536 U.S. at 775-79, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121170\"><a href=\"/opinion/121170/republican-party-of-minn-v-white/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2528</span></a></span>. And it furthers the Commonwealth's interest in diminishing reliance on political parties in judicial selection, a policy grounded in the Kentucky Constitution's requirement that judicial elections be nonpartisan in nature.</p>\n<p>The problem, however, is not the Commonwealth's laudable interests in promulgating this canon; it is the Commonwealth's methods in furthering them. The Court frequently says that censoring speech must be a government's measure of \"lastnot firstresort\" in advancing its policy interests, <i>e.g., </i><i>Thompson v. W. States Med. Ctr.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118499\"><a href=\"/opinion/118499/thompson-v-western-states-medical-center/\"><span class=\"volume\">535</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">357</span></a></span>, 373, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118499\"><a href=\"/opinion/118499/thompson-v-western-states-medical-center/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">563</span></a></span> (2002), and the narrow-tailoring requirement is proof that the Court means it. If a law does too much, or does too little, to advance the government's objectives, it will fail. <i>See </i><i>Eu,</i> 489 U.S. at 222, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112203\"><a href=\"/opinion/112203/eu-v-san-francisco-county-democratic-central-comm/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1013</span></a></span>. This canon does both.</p>\n<p>The canon's first problem is a <i>White</i> problemthat it suppresses too much speech to advance the government's interest. In invalidating Minnesota's announce clause, <i>White</i> established that a State may not prohibit a judicial candidate from disclosing, say, that \"I am for limited government,\" \"I support a woman's right to choose,\" \"I prefer tough-on-crime laws,\" or, to use an example from <i>White,</i> \"I think it is constitutional for the legislature to prohibit same-sex marriage.\" 536 U.S. at 779, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121170\"><a href=\"/opinion/121170/republican-party-of-minn-v-white/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2528</span></a></span>. The party affiliation clause prohibits all of this, only more so. It prohibits candidates from announcing their position on one issue of potential importance to voters: the party they support. And it prohibits them from announcing their position on many issues of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*202</span> potential importance to voters: the party platform with which they affiliate. A party platform after all is nothing more than an aggregation of political and legal positions, a shorthand way of announcing one's views on <i>many</i> topics of the day. If the single-issue announce canon at play in <i>White</i> prevented candidates from \"communicating relevant information to voters\" on \"matters of current public importance,\" and did not narrowly advance the State's interest in a non-partisan judiciary, <i>id.</i> at 781-82, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121170\"><a href=\"/opinion/121170/republican-party-of-minn-v-white/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2528</span></a></span>, the same is true of Kentucky's canon, which potentially prevents candidates from announcing their views on <i>many</i> issues at once. <i>See id.</i> at 782, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121170\"><a href=\"/opinion/121170/republican-party-of-minn-v-white/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2528</span></a></span> (\"We have never allowed the government to prohibit candidates from communicating relevant information to voters during an election.\").</p>\n<p>At the same time, the canon does too little to advance the State's interest in impartiality and the avoidance of partisan influence. Party affiliation, as it turns out, is not a forbidden topic. It is forbidden only when the candidate raises the point. If, by contrast, a voter asks the question in a one-on-one setting or in a small gathering, the candidate is free to say what she wants. That reality undermines the suggestion that a candidate deals a fatal blow to judicial impartiality by revealing her party affiliations. And of course, once that information is disclosed, whether in answer to a question or based on prior publicly known affiliations (including holding other elected offices), nothing in the canon prohibits <i>others,</i> whether newspapers or political parties or interest groups, from disclosing to the world the candidate's party affiliation. \"A law cannot be regarded as protecting an interest of the highest order, and thus as justifying a restriction upon truthful speech, when it leaves appreciable damage to that supposedly vital interest unprohibited.\" <i>Id.</i> at 780, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121170\"><a href=\"/opinion/121170/republican-party-of-minn-v-white/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2528</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>The clause undershoots its target in another respect. Although candidates may not reveal their party affiliation, they may discuss their membership in, affiliation with or support of any other type of organization, including organizations that take positions on judges and judicial philosophy. Although the two major political parties take positions on a wide array of issues, many interest groups advance a narrower set of positions and often do so more vocally, particularly with respect to judges. By identifying themselves with such groups, candidates can communicate more about their political and judicial convictions than they ever could by carrying a party membership cardand, in the process, may do as much to call judicial open-mindedness into question as any party affiliation ever would.</p>\n<p>The canon also prohibits only <i>disclosure</i> of a candidate's party membership, not party membership itself. Yet the appearance of judicial closed-mindedness is part and parcel of its reality, not a device designed to disguise reality. If concern over judicial partisanship and the influence of political parties on judging truly underlies the clause, the authorization to belong (secretly) to a political party amounts to a gaping omission. A party's undisclosed potential influence on candidates is far worse than its disclosed influence, as the one allows a full airing of the issue before the voters while the other helps to shield it from public view.</p>\n<p>Kentucky responds that the restriction supports the Kentucky Constitution's requirement that judicial elections be nonpartisanthat they operate with no partisan primaries and with no partisan identifiers at the ballot booth. <i>See</i> Ky. Const. § 117; Ky.Rev.Stat. § 118A.060. The point, however, cuts both ways. In one sense, it establishes the bona fides of the Commonwealth's policy. But in another <span class=\"star-pagination\">*203</span> sense, it undermines the Commonwealth's professed need to suppress speech in the process. Carey does not challenge the validity of prohibiting party identifiers on the ballot or the validity of holding non-partisan primaries. He just wishes to communicate about a matter of potential interest to the voters and one that is often already a point of public knowledgeparty affiliationon his own terms.</p>\n<p>Most States have not made the choice Kentucky did. Fifteen States choose their Supreme Court justices in contested, \"nonpartisan\" elections, and only five, including Kentucky, prohibit candidates in those elections from revealing their partisan affiliations. <i>See App'x A.</i> (Three more prohibit candidates from claiming to be \"a candidate of a political organization\" but do not prohibit revealing membership or affiliation. <i>Id.</i>) And two of these five canonsthis one and Wisconsin'shave been invalidated. <i>See </i><i>Siefert,</i> 608 F.3d at 983. That a majority of the States with nonpartisan Supreme Court elections have opted not to censor their candidates in this way of course does not establish the invalidity of the clause, but it does call into question the necessity of implementing Kentucky's nonpartisan judicial election system in this way and whether it amounts to the \"least restrictive means\" of protecting the Commonwealth's interests. <i>Playboy Entm't Group,</i> 529 U.S. at 813, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118369\"><a href=\"/opinion/118369/united-states-v-playboy-entertainment-group-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1878</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>The Commission says that the clause restricts as little speech as possible while preventing Kentucky's elections from turning into ultra-partisan affairs. It allows judges, the Commission adds, to join political parties, to participate in them and to disclose party affiliation if asked in the proper settingallowing voters who care about a candidate's partisan affiliation to discover it while preventing widespread advertisement of a candidate's party membership and preventing \"judicial races [from] turning into partisan political campaigns.\" Commission's Opening Br. at 66. Yet this argument looks at the problem through the wrong end of the telescope: It merely demonstrates that the clause does not restrict as much speech as it might, not that the clause restricts no more speech than is necessary.</p>\n<p>We do not doubt one of the premises of the canonthat party affiliation may not be a reliable indicator of the qualities that make a good judge. Yet \"[i]t is simply not the function of government to select which issues are worth discussing or debating in the course of a political campaign,\" <i>White,</i> 536 U.S. at 782, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121170\"><a href=\"/opinion/121170/republican-party-of-minn-v-white/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2528</span></a></span> (quotation omitted), and it is difficult to see how Kentucky's speech restriction does not do just that. Informational bans premised on the fear that voters cannot handle the disclosure have a long history of being legislatively tried and judicially struck, whether in the election setting or elsewhere. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Brown,</i> 456 U.S. at 60, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110689\"><a href=\"/opinion/110689/brown-v-hartlage/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

And while political identification may be an unhelpful way to pick judges, it assuredly beats other grounds, such as the all-too-familiar formula of running candidates with familiar or popular last names. In that respect, this informational ban increases the likelihood that one of the least relevant grounds for judicial selectionthe fortuity of one's surnameis all that the voters will have to go on. As the district court correctly concluded, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*204</span> this clause violates the First Amendment on its face.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B.</h2>\n<p><i>Solicitation clause.</i> Kentucky prohibits judicial candidates from \"solicit[ing] campaign funds,\" a restriction that extends to all fundraising by the candidate, including in-person solicitations, group solicitations, telephone calls and letters. Rules of Supreme Court of Kentucky 4.300, Canon 5(B)(2). The clause permits the candidate to establish a committee that may solicit campaign donations, and it permits the committee to disclose to the candidate the names of people who donated to the campaign and those who declined. <i>See id.</i> Kentucky says that the clause satisfies the First Amendment, but we, like the district court, conclude that it does not.</p>\n<p>As with the party affiliation clause, we do not doubt the bona fides of the solicitation clause: that it serves Kentucky's compelling interest in an impartial judiciary. The same goes for its interest in preserving the appearance and reality of a non-corrupt judiciary, an objective often served by fundraising limitations. <i>See </i><i>Fed. Election Comm'n v. Nat'l Conservative Political Action Comm.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111370\"><a href=\"/opinion/111370/federal-election-commn-v-national-conservative-political-action-comm/\"><span class=\"volume\">470</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">480</span></a></span>, 496-97, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111370\"><a href=\"/opinion/111370/federal-election-commn-v-national-conservative-political-action-comm/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Litigants have a due process right to a trial before a judge with no \"direct, personal, substantial pecuniary interest\" in the outcome, <i>Tumey v.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2252</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>Preserving these interests, we also acknowledge, grows more complicated when a State exercises its sovereign right to select judges through popular elections. Judicial elections, like most elections, require moneyoften a lot of it. Kentucky's 2006 Supreme Court election, which featured four contested races and one uncontested race, saw ten candidates raise a total of $2,119,871, of which the candidates spent $772,563 on 2,357 television commercials. Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of Law, <i>The New Politics of Judicial Elections 2006</i> at 3, 16. \"Unless the pool of judicial candidates is limited to those wealthy enough to independently fund their campaigns, a limitation unrelated to judicial skill, the cost of campaigning requires judicial candidates to engage in fundraising.\" <i>White,</i> 536 U.S. at 789-90, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121170\"><a href=\"/opinion/121170/republican-party-of-minn-v-white/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2528</span></a></span> (O'Connor, J., concurring). Complicating matters further, the general public often, though not invariably, pays less attention to judicial elections than other elections, forcing judicial candidates to focus their fundraising efforts on the segment of the population most likely to have an interest in judicial races: the bar. \"This leads to the unseemly situation in which judges preside over cases in which the parties are represented by counsel who have contributed in varying amounts to the judicial campaigns.\" <i>Stretton,</i> 944 F.2d at 145.</p>\n<p>That the clause advances important government interests, however, does not establish that it does so narrowly. Prohibiting candidates from asking for money suppresses speech in the most conspicuous of ways and, in the process, favors some candidates over othersincumbent judges (who benefit from their current status) over non-judicial candidates, the well-to-do (who may not need to raise any money at all) over lower-income candidates, and the well-connected (who have an army of potential fundraisers) over outsiders. For these reasons, it is tempting to say that <i>any</i> limitation on <span class=\"star-pagination\">*205</span> a candidate's right to ask for a campaign contribution is one limitation too many. But there are at least two areas covered by the clause that test such an interpretationface-to-face solicitations, particularly by sitting judges, and solicitations of individuals with cases pending in front of the court. Yet we need not decide the validity of such restrictions today because Kentucky goes well beyond them.</p>\n<p>Besides covering in-person solicitations and those directed at individuals with pending cases, the canon prohibits a range of other solicitations, including speeches to large groups and signed mass mailings. Such indirect methods of solicitation present little or no risk of undue pressure or the appearance of a quid pro quo. No one could reasonably believe that a failure to respond to a signed mass mailing asking for donations would result in unfair treatment in future dealings with the judge. Nor would a speech requesting donations from a large gathering have a \"coercive effect\" on reasonable attendees. Commission's Opening Br. at 55; <i>compare </i><i>Ohralik v.

Although the candidate himself may not solicit donations, his campaign committee may. And nothing prevents a committee member from soliciting donations in person. That leaves a rule preventing a candidate from sending a signed mass mailing to every voter in the district but permitting the candidate's best friend to ask for a donation directly from an attorney who frequently practices before the court. Are not the risks of coercion and undue appearance far less with the first (prohibited) solicitation than the second (permitted) one?</p>\n<p>Although the clause prevents judicial candidates from saying \"please, give me a donation,\" it does not prevent them from saying \"thank you\" for a donation given. The clause bars any solicitation, whether in a large group or small one, whether by letter or one on one, but it does not bar the candidate from learning how individuals responded to the committee's solicitations. That omission suggests that the only interest at play is the impolitic interpersonal dynamics of a candidate's request for money, not the more corrosive reality of who gives and how much. If the purported risk addressed by the clause is that the judge or candidate will treat donors and non-donors differently, it is knowing who contributed and who balked that makes the difference, not who asked for the contribution. If Kentucky fears that judges will allow campaign donations to affect their rulings, it must believe that \"[s]uccessful candidates will feel beholden to the people who helped them get elected regardless of who did the soliciting of support.\" <i>Weaver,</i> 309 F.3d at 1323.</p>\n<p>Two other circuits have considered the validity of similar canons and have come to similar conclusions. In <i>Weaver,</i> the Eleventh Circuit considered a Georgia rule providing <span class=\"star-pagination\">*206</span> that judicial candidates \"shall not themselves solicit campaign funds.\" 309 F.3d at 1315. Relying on many of the same means-end problems identified here, the court concluded that the canon was \"not narrowly tailored to serve Georgia's compelling interest in judicial impartiality.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1322. In <i>White II,</i> on remand after the Supreme Court invalidated Minnesota's \"announce\" clause, the Eighth Circuit invalidated a canon that prohibited judicial candidates from \"personally solicit[ing] or accept[ing] campaign contributions.\" 416 F.3d at 745. In <i>Siefert,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"148492\"><a href=\"/opinion/148492/siefert-v-alexander/\"><span class=\"volume\">608</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">974</span></a></span>, the Seventh Circuit upheld Wisconsin's prohibition on judges' \"personal[ ] solicit[ation]\" of campaign contributions. <i>See</i> 608 F.3d at 990. But, in doing so, it focused on the problems associated with \"direct\" solicitation and did not consider the validity of applying the canon to mass mailings and group solicitationsthe most troubling scenarios here. <i>See id.</i> at 989-90.</p>\n<p>The state defendants push back, arguing that, even though a candidate may discover her donors' identities from the campaign committee, the solicitation clause makes \"favoritism\" toward contributors \"more difficult.\" Commission's Opening Br. at 57. After all, they reason, when a candidate asks for a donation in person, she immediately will find out whether the donor gives and how much. <i>Id.</i> That may or may not be true. But even if we grant the Commonwealth's premisethat in-person solicitations always lead to more immediate information about donations or rejectionsthat suggests only that the solicitation clause may be constitutional in some settings. It does not resolve the clause's considerable overbreadth: its application to mass-mailing solicitations or speeches to a large audience.</p>\n<p>But the solicitation clause must be constitutional, the state defendants add, because most other States with judicial elections also prevent candidates from soliciting funds. <i>See</i> Commission's Opening Br. at 53. The argument is not as helpful as they suggest. By our count, twenty-two States currently elect judges to their highest courts in contested elections. (States with retention elections are less relevant because by definition they do not involve two candidates competing for the same seat.) Of these twenty-two States, thirteen, including Kentucky, prohibit candidates from soliciting campaign contributions. <i>See App'x B.</i> (Two more have hortatory canons telling candidates they \"should not\" or are \"strongly discouraged\" from personally soliciting. <i>Id.</i>) Yet this bare majority is no more dispositive here than it was in <i>White,</i> where twenty-six States had some form of announce clause. <i>See </i><i>White,</i> 536 U.S. at 786, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121170\"><a href=\"/opinion/121170/republican-party-of-minn-v-white/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

No less importantly, we do not decide today whether a State <i>could</i> enact a narrowly tailored solicitation clausesay, one focused on one-on-one solicitations or solicitations from individuals with cases pending before the courtonly that this clause does not do so narrowly.</p>\n<p>The Commonwealth to its credit wishes to avoid cases like <i>Simes v.

The solicitation clause is overbroad and thus invalid on its face.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C.</h2>\n<p><i>The commits clause.</i> In prohibiting judicial candidates from \"intentionally or recklessly mak[ing] a statement that a reasonable person would perceive as committing a judge or candidate to rule a certain way in a case, controversy, or issue that is likely to come before the court,\" Canon 5(B)(1)(c), the commits clause covers a range of campaign statements. Some of those restrictions are legitimate. Others may not be. And there is a \"vast middle ground of uncertainty\" between the two. <i>Outlaw v. Airtech Air Conditioning &amp; Heating, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"186462\"><a href=\"/opinion/186462/outlaw-phyllis-j-v-airtech-air-condtng/\"><span class=\"volume\">412</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">156</span></a></span>, 161 (D.C.Cir. 2005) (Roberts, J.).</p>\n<p>In what seems to be its core sense, the clause, found in one form or another in 39 States, <i>see App'x C,</i> runs the gauntlet of strict scrutiny. By preventing candidates from making \"statement[s]\" that \"commit[ ]\" them \"to rule a certain way in a case [or] controversy,\" the clause secures a basic objective of the judiciary, one so basic that due process requires it: that litigants have a right to air their disputes before judges who have not committed to rule against them before the opening brief is read. <i>See </i><i>Caperton,</i> 129 S.Ct. at 2266-67; <i>Bracy v.

Whatever else a fair adjudication requires, it demands that judges decide cases based on the law and facts before them, not based on \"express ... commitments that they may have made to their campaign supporters.\" <i>Buckley v. Ill. Judicial Inquiry Bd.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"610615\"><a href=\"/opinion/610615/robert-c-buckley-and-illinois-judges-association-intervening-v-illinois/\"><span class=\"volume\">997</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">224</span></a></span>, 227 (7th Cir.1993). No one, Carey included, disputes that the Commonwealth has a compelling interest in \"prohibit[ing] candidates from promising to rule a certain way on cases.\" Carey's Opening Br. at 14-15.</p>\n<p>Nor does Carey dispute that the clause narrowly advances this interestif, that is, the clause is confined to campaign \"commitments\" with respect to \"cases\" or \"controversies.\" So limited, the clause targets the kinds of interests <i>White</i> suggests the States may protect, as judicial commitments with respect to cases and controversies implicate not just a lack of open mindedness about the law but a lack of impartiality in its most essential sensea commitment to rule for one <i>party</i> over another. <i>See </i><i>White,</i> 536 U.S. at 775-76, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121170\"><a href=\"/opinion/121170/republican-party-of-minn-v-white/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2528</span></a></span> (\"[I]mpartiality\" in \"the traditional sense\" means \"apply[ing] the law to [one party] in the same way [one] applies it to any other party.\"). The First Amendment permits a State to limit speech when the Due Process Clause demands nothing less.</p>\n<p>But the canon does not stop there. It also prevents candidates from making commitments about \"issues.\" A commitment to rule a certain way on \"issues likely to come before the court\" covers a raft of electioneering stands, and it unmoors the prohibition from \"cases\" or \"controversies\" and the party-specific connotations that come with those terms. As <i>White</i> reminds us, \"there is almost no legal or political <i>issue</i> that is unlikely to come before a judge of an American court, state or federal, of general jurisdiction.\" <i>White,</i> 536 U.S. at 772, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121170\"><a href=\"/opinion/121170/republican-party-of-minn-v-white/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2528</span></a></span> (emphasis added and quotation omitted). To make matters worse, the commentary to the clause says that it covers the \"appearance\" of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*208</span> making \"issue\"-related commitments. Canon 5(B)(1)(c), Cmt.</p>\n<p>Think back to <i>White.</i> How is a judicial candidate's \"announcement\" of a position on a legal \"issue\" during an election campaign not likely to create the \"appearance\" that the candidate has \"committed\" to \"rule a certain way\" on the \"issue\"? And, if that is so, how can this aspect of the canon survive <i>White,</i> given that it seems to ban what <i>White</i> permits? These are good questions, but they prompt an even more basic one: what exactly does the \"issues\" prohibition cover?</p>\n<p>The clause contains a serious level-of-generality problem. At the broadest level of meaning, it would seem to cover issue-related promises like these: \"I commit to follow <i>stare decisis</i>\"; \"I commit to follow an originalist theory of constitutional interpretation\" or for that matter \"a living constitutionalist theory\"; \"I commit to a purposive method of statutory interpretation\" or for that matter a \"textual\" one; \"I commit to use (or not to use) legislative history\"; or \"I commit to be a rule-of-law judge.\" One might reasonably say that the clause covers all of these statements, as they all relate to \"issues\" likely to come before a court and they all create an \"appearance\" of commitment. Yet if that is what the clause means, it is hard to square with the Constitution. A restriction on such promises does nothing to prevent the kind of \"impartiality\" that the States have an interest in securingdefined as bias (or the appearance of bias) toward particular parties or cases. <i>See </i><i>White,</i> 536 U.S. at 776-77, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121170\"><a href=\"/opinion/121170/republican-party-of-minn-v-white/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2528</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>In a narrower sense, however, the \"issues\" prohibition may serve that interest. In <i>White</i> itself, the Court contemplated that a State could prevent a candidate from highlighting an \"unbroken record of affirming convictions for rape\" because such statements would \"exhibit a bias against parties,\" namely against these types of criminal defendants and in favor of the prosecutor in these types of appeals. 536 U.S. at 777 n. 7, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121170\"><a href=\"/opinion/121170/republican-party-of-minn-v-white/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2528</span></a></span> (Stevens, J., dissenting). An interpretation of the clause confined to these kinds of statements thus might advance a compelling state interest and do so narrowly.</p>\n<p>In a facial challenge like this one, the ultimate question is one of overbreadth: Does the law \"prohibit[] a substantial amount of protected speech both in an absolute sense and relative to [the canons'] plainly legitimate sweep\"? <i>Connection Distrib. Co.,</i> 557 F.3d at 336 (internal quotations omitted). To determine the extent of a law's illegitimate reach, one needs to know what it means, as \"it is impossible to determine whether a statute reaches too far without first knowing what the statute covers.\" <i>United States v. Williams,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145810\"><a href=\"/opinion/145810/united-states-v-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">553</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">285</span></a></span>, 293, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145810\"><a href=\"/opinion/145810/united-states-v-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">650</span></a></span> (2008).</p>\n<p>That inquiry has not happened hereat least with respect to the \"issues\" prohibition. In upholding this clause, the district court focused on its application to \"cases\" and \"controversies\" and, to that extent, we agree with its analysis for the reasons noted. But the district court did not explore the clause's applicability to \"issues,\" the array of settings in which that part of the clause and commentary may apply and the tension of several of them with <i>White.</i> At oral argument, we asked the parties about the point. Carey agreed that the commits clause would satisfy the First Amendment if the clause did not contain an \"issues\" component to it, and saw the addition of the \"issues\" language (together with the commentary) as having two impermissible effects: chilling candidates' free-speech rights to discuss their legal philosophies freely, and effectively sidestepping <i>White</i> by prohibiting candidates <span class=\"star-pagination\">*209</span> from announcing their positions on legal issues. The state defendants suggested that a narrowing construction of the \"issues\" clause could save it.</p>\n<p>Under these circumstances, discretion, to say nothing of respect for a co-equal sovereign, is the better part of valor. At this point it is not clear what the Commonwealth's position on the term is, and the district court has not yet explored these issues. If we remand this aspect of the case to the district court, the court will have that chance. So too will the partiesparticularly the state defendants, who retain considerable authority over shaping the clause and the commentary that goes with it. The state defendants may be able to obtain authority to remove the \"issues\" language; they may be able to identify an acceptable narrowing construction of the \"issues\" language along with a modification to the commentary; or they may suggest certification to the Kentucky Supreme Court. Any of these options may spare the federal courts the task of resolving a difficult constitutional question, and at a minimum they will give the Commonwealth a first shot at addressing the question.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>There is room for debate about whether the election of state court judges is a good idea or a bad one. Yet there is no room for debate that, if a State opts to select its judges through popular elections, it must comply with the First Amendment in doing so. In this case, we have upheld some components of Kentucky's Code of Judicial Conduct, invalidated others and sought clarification of still one other provision. Through it all, no one should lose sight of the reality that a judicial candidate's right to engage in certain types of speech says nothing about the desirability of that speech. The First Amendment protects the meek and brazen, the \"offensive\" and agreeable. <i>Texas v.

I would go further and affirm the District Court in upholding the entire commits clause, including the issues portion. The majority's concern with an overly broad interpretation of what constitutes a commitment to vote a certain way or bias toward a party based on campaign promises regarding an \"issue,\" amounts to the construction of a straw man. I believe a candidate for judge knows exactly when she is making a commitment, or giving the appearance of such a commitment. I believe the same is true of the enforcer of the canons. Is there any doubt about commitment when a candidate professes to believe that life begins at conception? Is there any committed bias in favor of a potential party when a candidate for judge states a \"strong belief in the right to keep and bear arms?\" Maybe the definition of <i>White-permitted</i> issue commitments is like the definition of pornography. Anyone with common sense knows the portent of a campaign commitment when he hears it. Yet by remand we are asking the District Court to do what the Supreme Court could not do in <i>White</i> and we are unable to do here.</p>\n<p>Maintenance of public confidence that a litigant will receive an unbiased hearing in the courts is as compelling an interest as any possessed by the Commonwealth of Kentucky. The canon here appropriately addresses that interest. Definitional disagreements, if they arise, can be addressed when they arise.</p>\n<p>I respectfully dissent from the holding of the majority vacating the District Court in respect to the commits clause.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  The Honorable Thomas A. Wiseman, Jr., Senior United States District Judge for the Middle District of Tennessee, sitting by designation.</p>\n\n</div>",
