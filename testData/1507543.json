We agree with the Tax Court that in considering the separation instrument as a whole it becomes clear that of the $6,000 paid to the wife for the taxable year, a minimum of $200 per month is earmarked for the support of the petitioner's minor son.</p>\n<p>Wherefore, the decision of the Tax Court sustaining the deficiency assessment of the respondent is hereby affirmed upon the reasoning of the Tax Court's opinion.</p>\n</div>",
