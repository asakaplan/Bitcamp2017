In this diversity case, the city of Cleveland, Ohio\n(“Cleveland”), brings a public nuisance suit against twenty-two financial entities\n(“Defendants”) that it claims are responsible for a large portion of the subprime lending\n                                        1\nmarket in Cleveland and nationally. Cleveland argues that the Defendants’ financing of\nsubprime mortgages, the alleged public nuisance, led to a foreclosure crisis in Cleveland\nthat devastated its neighborhoods and economy. On appeal, Cleveland initially contends\n\n\n        1\n          In Ohio, a public nuisance is defined as “an unreasonable interference with a right common to\nthe general public.” Cincinnati v. Beretta U.S.A. Corp., 768 N.E.2d 1136, 1142 (Ohio 2002) (quoting\nRestatement (Second) of Torts § 821B(1)).\n\fNo. 09-3608         City of Cleveland v. Ameriquest Mortgage                          Page 3\n                    Securities, et al.\n\n\nthat the district court erred when it refused to remand this suit to Ohio state court. It also\nappeals, on the merits, the district court’s four independent reasons for dismissing this\nsuit pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure: (1) preemption,\n(2) the economic loss rule, (3) unreasonable interference of a public right, and\n(4) proximate cause. The district court considered each reason to be dispositive in favor\nof all Defendants. For the reasons that follow, we AFFIRM.\n\n                                      I. Background\n\n                                 A. Factual Background\n\n        In its complaint, Cleveland acknowledges that, for the most part, the Defendants\ndid not originate the subprime mortgages at issue in this appeal. Nevertheless, it alleges\nthat the Defendants’ financing, purchasing, and pooling of vast amounts of these loans,\nto create mortgage-backed securities to sell to their customers, constituted a public\nnuisance. Cleveland puts forward the following factual pattern to support its claim:\n\n        (1) Wall Street made cash available to subprime lenders, which (2) used\n        the funds to make subprime loans to consumers, then (3) sold the related\n        mortgages back to the same cadre of Wall Street, which (4) packaged\n        them and sold the income they generated to investors in the form of\n        mortgage-backed securities, and (5) used the proceeds to repeat the\n        process.\n\n        Cleveland maintains that, beginning in 2003, the Defendants became more\nbrazen in their lending activities and began to direct lenders on the types of loans to issue\nto meet the Defendants’ securitization needs. These pressures “subverted the normal\noperation of the mortgage market and inevitably led to the abandonment of meaningful\nunderwriting standards.” Because of growth in the real-estate market, the Defendants\nignored these issues and turned a blind-eye even when loans made no economic sense.\nThe complaint concludes that these “securitizers” were principally responsible for the\nfinancial crisis.\n\n        Cleveland alleges that the factors that led to the housing bubble never\nmaterialized in Cleveland because of its high rate of poverty, sluggish job market,\n\fNo. 09-3608           City of Cleveland v. Ameriquest Mortgage                  Page 4\n                      Securities, et al.\n\n\nstruggling Rust-Belt economy, declining manufacturing sector, sparse housing demand,\nand difficulty fostering new industries. Cleveland’s unique economic plight and its\nstagnant housing market made mass foreclosures the foreseeable and inevitable result\nof the subprime financing provided by the Defendants. The Defendants knew about\nthese unique issues but nevertheless continued to finance subprime mortgages in\nCleveland. These activities led to thousands of foreclosed homes in neighborhoods\nthroughout Cleveland that became “eyesores, fire hazards, and easy prey for looters and\ndrug dealers in search of a place to conduct their business.”\n\n       Cleveland claims that each foreclosure creates tangible costs for the city,\nincluding increased expenditures for fire and police protection and maintenance and\ndemolition costs. Tax revenues also plummeted because of the decline in housing values\ndue to the foreclosed homes. Cleveland seeks to recover millions in municipal\nexpenditures and diminished tax revenues as damages.\n\n                                 B. Procedural Background\n\n       Cleveland filed suit on January 10, 2008, in the Court of Common Pleas for\nCuyahoga County, Ohio. It brought a single claim of public nuisance against twenty-one\ndefendants—some of which are current Defendants. Asserting diversity of citizenship,\nLehman Brothers Holdings, Inc. (“Lehman Brothers”),2 removed the suit to the Northern\nDistrict of Ohio on January 16, 2008. Cleveland moved the next day to remand the case\nto state court. It argued that Lehman Brothers’s removal was improper because Lehman\nBrothers was required to either obtain the unanimous consent of all of the defendants\nbefore removing the case or explain in its Notice of Removal why it did not pursue this\ncourse of action. All of the defendants joined a motion opposing the motion to remand\nshortly thereafter. After supplemental briefing and oral argument, the district court\ndenied Cleveland’s motion to remand on August 8, 2008. City of Cleveland v. Deutsche\nBank Trust Co., 571 F. Supp. 2d 807 (N.D. Ohio 2008).\n\n\n\n       2\n           Lehman Brothers is no longer a Defendant.\n\fNo. 09-3608           City of Cleveland v. Ameriquest Mortgage                                  Page 5\n                      Securities, et al.\n\n\n         Subsequently, Cleveland filed a new public nuisance claim in state court. It\nmade allegations similar to those found in the original complaint but brought the suit\nagainst some new defendants and some affiliates of the original defendants. For\nexample, Countrywide Financial Corp. was a defendant in the original suit, but\nCleveland sued Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. and Countrywide Securities Corp. in its\nnew state court suit. A Joint Motion for Entry of Agreed Order Regarding Plaintiff’s\nMotion for Leave to Amend (“Joint Motion”) was then agreed to,3 which the district\ncourt approved. The Joint Motion was intended “to resolve the disagreement that has\narisen between the parties and to avoid protracted litigation . . . .” City of Cleveland v.\nDeutsche Bank Trust Co., No. 1:08-CV-00139 (N.D. Ohio September 29, 2008) (order\napproving Joint Motion). Among other things, it limited which defendants Cleveland\ncould sue. Afterwards, Cleveland filed its Second Amended complaint in federal\ncourt—the complaint at issue in this appeal—against the current Defendants.\n\n         Defendants filed eight separate motions to dismiss—some individually and some\ncollectively. The district court dismissed the complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) on\nMay 15, 2009, for four independent reasons. City of Cleveland v. Ameriquest Mortg.\nSec., Inc., 621 F. Supp. 2d 513 (N.D. Ohio 2009). First, the court held that Ohio Rev.\nCode § 1.63, an Ohio state law that forbids municipalities from engaging in mortgage\nregulation, preempted Cleveland’s public nuisance claim. Id. at 520. Second, the court\nheld that Ohio’s economic loss rule barred Cleveland’s claim. Id. at 526. Third, the\ncourt held that subprime lending cannot form the basis of a public nuisance claim\nbecause it is legal, and that, by extension, funding subprime lending also cannot be a\npublic nuisance. Id. at 531. Fourth, the court held that the assertions in Cleveland’s\ncomplaint were insufficient to satisfy the directness requirement of proximate cause\nbecause its allegations did not “demonstrate any direct relationship between its alleged\ninjury and [the] Defendants’ conduct.” Id. at 533. The court declined to rule on the\n\n\n\n         3\n          Cleveland entered into a separate agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and Wells Fargo\nAsset Securities Corporation, where it also agreed to pursue all claims “in federal court in the federal\nnuisance action.” GMAC-RFC was not a party to the Joint Motion.\n\fNo. 09-3608            City of Cleveland v. Ameriquest Mortgage                                   Page 6\n                       Securities, et al.\n\n\nother four motions because it found its rulings on the four issues it considered to be\ndispositive for all of the Defendants. Id. at 516. Cleveland appeals.\n\n                                            II. Analysis\n\n                                      A. Motion to Remand\n\n         Cleveland argues that the district court should have remanded this case to Ohio\ncourt because the Defendants’ removal was defective. However, Cleveland waived its\nright to pursue this issue on appeal because the Joint Motion contained a clause that\nstated: “Plaintiff shall prosecute the public nuisance claim against the Eliminated\nDefendants and the Amended Defendants, if at all, exclusively in this Court and as part\nof this case . . . .”4 It is well-established that the waiver of a party’s right to removal\nmust be clear and unequivocal. See, e.g., Cadle Co. v. Reiner, Reiner & Bendett, P.C.,\n307 F. App’x 884, 886 (6th Cir. 2009). Further, “[g]eneral principles of contract\ninterpretation apply when determining whether a clause explicitly waives the right of\nremoval.” Id. (citing In re Delta Am. Re Ins. Co., 900 F.2d 890, 892 (6th Cir. 1990)).\n\n         Here, there is no plausible way to read this language as anything other than a\nclear and unequivocal waiver of Cleveland’s right to further pursue its motion to remand\non appeal, and Cleveland neither contests the validity of the Joint Motion nor suggests\nan alternative reading of this clause.5 Instead, Cleveland contends that, despite the\nexpress language in the Joint Motion, it did not waive its right to appeal this ruling\nbecause it made a tactical decision based on time and money to enter into the agreement.\nThese reasons are inadequate to void the agreement under the general principles of\ncontract law. Therefore, the Joint Motion precludes Cleveland from now arguing that\n\n\n\n         4\n         All of the current Defendants were parties in the Joint Motion and were listed as either Amended\nDefendants or Eliminated Defendants, except for GMAC-RFC. GMAC-RFC was not a party to the Joint\nMotion, and was neither an Amended Defendant nor an Eliminated Defendant.\n         5\n          Cleveland could have contested the effect of the Joint Motion on its claim against GMAC-RFC.\nHowever, Cleveland has not made this argument in its briefs or at oral argument, so it is waived. See Farm\nLabor Org. Comm. v. Ohio State Highway Patrol, 308 F.3d 523, 544 n.8 (6th Cir. 2002) (“It is well\nestablished that an issue not raised in a party’s briefs on appeal may be deemed waived.”).\n\fNo. 09-3608         City of Cleveland v. Ameriquest Mortgage                         Page 7\n                    Securities, et al.\n\n\nthe district court should have remanded this suit, and the district court properly permitted\nthis case to proceed in federal court.\n\n        Furthermore, even if we ignore the Joint Motion, the district court still properly\ndeclined to remand this case. We review a district court’s refusal to remand de novo.\nHarper v. AutoAlliance Int’l, Inc., 392 F.3d 195, 200 (6th Cir. 2004). Cleveland argues\nthat the district court’s ruling did not conform with the rule of unanimity. The “rule of\nunanimity demands that all defendants must join in a petition to remove a state case to\nfederal court.” Loftis v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 342 F.3d 509, 516 (6th Cir. 2003).\nThis circuit has identified at least three ways to satisfy this rule: all parties that have\nbeen served or otherwise properly joined may (1) join in the removal, (2) file a written\nconsent to removal, or (3) oppose a motion to remand. Brierly v. Alusuisse Flexible\nPackaging, Inc., 184 F.3d 527, 533 n.3 (6th Cir. 1999) (the first two options); Harper,\n392 F.3d at 202 (the third option). The Defendants met two of these conditions. First,\nafter Lehman Brothers filed its notice of removal on January 16, 2008, each Defendant\nfiled a consent to removal, the last of which was filed February 1, 2008, within the thirty\nday period. Second, after Cleveland filed its motion to remand on January 17, 2008, all\nof the Defendants opposed Cleveland’s motion to remand on February 1, 2008, also\nwithin the thirty day period.\n\n        We note that Cleveland has waived its argument that the rule of unanimity was\nviolated because Bear Stearns’s consent to removal was invalid. At oral argument,\nCleveland conceded that it had purposefully waited to raise this argument until oral\nargument for its motion to remand, while believing that its general motion for remand\nwould allow it to challenge Bear Stearns’s consent after thirty days. Cleveland\nemployed this suspect approach despite indicating in its Reply Brief in Support of\nMotion for Remand, filed on February 8, 2008, that “[a]ll of the defendants did\neventually give their consent to removal.” Because the argument raised by Cleveland\nat oral argument is inconsistent with the arguments it made during the thirty day period,\nit has waived its objection to Bear Stearns’s consent. See Mellon v. Int’l Shoe Co., 32\nF.2d 390, 391 (D. Mass. 1929) (“This action was entirely inconsistent with the position\n\fNo. 09-3608        City of Cleveland v. Ameriquest Mortgage                        Page 8\n                   Securities, et al.\n\n\ntaken in the motion to remand, and, having been done without any reservation of rights\nunder the motion, had the effect of waiving the motion.”). In any case, Bear Stearns also\njoined the opposition to remand, as did all of the Defendants, and this action alone was\nsufficient to satisfy the rule of unanimity.\n\n       Thus, we now turn to the district court’s dismissal of this suit pursuant to Rule\n12(b)(6). For the sake of judicial efficiency, we begin, and end, our analysis with the\ndistrict court’s proximate cause ruling.\n\n                                B. Standard of Review\n\n       We review de novo the district court’s dismissal pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).\nMezibov v. Allen, 411 F.3d 712, 716 (6th Cir. 2005). We construe the complaint in a\nlight most favorable to the nonmoving party and accept all plausible well-pled factual\nallegations as true. Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 556 (2007), and\nCommercial Money Ctr., Inc. v. Ill. Union Ins. Co., 508 F.3d 327, 336 (6th Cir. 2007).\n“To state a valid claim, a complaint must contain direct or inferential allegations\nrespecting all the material elements under some viable legal theory.” Id. at 336-37\n(citing Mezibov, 411 F.3d at 716).\n\n                                  C. Applicable Law\n\n       Because this suit is before us pursuant to our diversity jurisdiction, we apply the\nsubstantive law of Ohio and federal procedural law. Biegas v. Quickway Carriers, Inc.,\n573 F.3d 365, 374 (6th Cir. 2009). When applying the substantive law of Ohio, we must\n“follow the decisions of the state’s highest court when that court has addressed the\nrelevant issue.” Savedoff v. Access Group, Inc., 524 F.3d 754, 762 (6th Cir. 2008)\n(quoting Talley v. State Farm Fire & Cas. Co., 223 F.3d 323, 326 (6th Cir. 2000)). “If\nthe issue has not been directly addressed, we must ‘anticipate how the relevant state’s\nhighest court would rule in the case and are bound by controlling decisions of that\ncourt.” Id. (quoting In re Dow Corning Corp., 419 F.3d 543, 549 (6th Cir. 2005)).\n\fNo. 09-3608        City of Cleveland v. Ameriquest Mortgage                       Page 9\n                   Securities, et al.\n\n\n                                D. Proximate Cause\n\n       Cleveland argues that its complaint alleged facts sufficient to satisfy the\ndirectness requirement. The directness requirement “requires some direct relation\nbetween the injury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged.” Holmes v. Sec. Investor\nProt. Corp., 503 U.S. 258, 268 (1992). Although not the sole element, the requirement\nof a direct injury is a “central element” of proximate cause. Perry v. Am. Tobacco Co.,\n324 F.3d 845, 848 (6th Cir. 2003).        Notably, this requirement is distinct from\nforeseeability and applies even if the Defendants intentionally caused the alleged course\nof events. Id. at 850. Accordingly, although Cleveland asserts that the Defendants knew\nabout the consequences of subprime lending, this allegation is not relevant to our\ndirectness requirement analysis.\n\n       Holmes is the seminal United States Supreme Court decision that discusses the\ndirectness requirement, and the Ohio Supreme Court has adopted the Holmes Court’s\nproximate cause analysis. Cincinnati v. Beretta U.S.A. Corp., 768 N.E.2d 1136, 1148-49\n(Ohio 2002). Holmes is therefore the focus of our directness requirement analysis. In\nHolmes, the plaintiff, Securities Investor Protection Corporation (“SIPC”), brought suit\nagainst several defendants under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations\nAct (“RICO”). Holmes, 503 U.S. at 262. SIPC alleged that these defendants conspired\nto fraudulently manipulate stocks, which led to the insolvency of two securities broker-\ndealers. Id. at 261. As a result, the broker-dealers failed to satisfy their financial\nobligations to their customers, and SIPC, a provider of insurance to bankrupt broker-\ndealers that could no longer pay their customers, was forced to cover the broker-dealers’\ndebts. Id. at 262-63. SIPC sued for reimbursement, but the Court declined to find\nliability because “the link [was] too remote between the stock manipulation alleged and\nthe customers’ harm, being purely contingent on the harm suffered by the broker-\ndealers.” Id. at 271.\n\n        In Beretta, the Ohio Supreme Court summarized the three reasons given in\nHolmes for a directness requirement:\n\fNo. 09-3608         City of Cleveland v. Ameriquest Mortgage                       Page 10\n                    Securities, et al.\n\n\n        (1) indirectness adds to the difficulty in determining which of the\n        plaintiff’s damages can be attributed to the defendant’s misconduct,\n        (2) recognizing the claims of the indirectly injured would complicate the\n        apportionment of damages among plaintiffs to avoid multiple recoveries,\n        and (3) these complications are unwarranted given the availability of\n        other parties who are directly injured and who can remedy the harm\n        without these associated problems.\n\nBeretta, 768 N.E.2d at 1148 (citing Holmes, 503 U.S. at 269-70). The United States\nSupreme Court has since noted that these factors in Holmes are relevant to determine\nwhether a plaintiff has sufficiently pleaded proximate cause, but all three factors do not\nneed to be present for remoteness to bar recovery. Anza v. Ideal Steel Supply Corp., 547\nU.S. 451, 459 (2006) (noting that the second factor was not implicated yet still holding\nthat the plaintiff had failed to sufficiently allege proximate cause).\n\n        As an initial matter, Cleveland contends that the district court’s proximate cause\nanalysis at the motion to dismiss stage was premature. As support, it cites this court’s\ndecision in Trollinger v. Tyson Foods, Inc., 370 F.3d 602 (6th Cir. 2004). In that case,\nformer employees of a poultry plant sued under RICO, and alleged that the defendant,\nthe poultry plant owner, schemed with employment agencies to depress wages by hiring\nillegal immigrants. Id. We refrained from engaging in a proximate cause analysis at the\npleadings stage because we perceived that the analysis would be too speculative. Id. at\n619. However, contrary to Cleveland’s suggestions otherwise, there is no per se rule\nagainst dismissing a complaint for failure to adequately plead proximate cause. In fact,\nsubsequent to Trollinger, the Supreme Court dismissed the complaint in Anza at the\nmotion to dismiss stage for failure to plead proximate cause. See Anza, 547 U.S. at 453.\nCleveland still has an obligation to file a complaint that is “plausible on its face.” Bell,\n550 U.S. at 556. Accordingly, we, just as the Supreme Court in Anza, proceed to the\nquestion of whether the complaint sufficiently pleaded proximate cause and, specifically,\nwhether the allegations in the complaint satisfy the directness requirement.\n\n        For the purposes of answering this question, the Supreme Court’s application of\nHolmes in its subsequent decision Anza is instructive and consistent with how we believe\n\fNo. 09-3608         City of Cleveland v. Ameriquest Mortgage                        Page 11\n                    Securities, et al.\n\n\nthe Ohio Supreme Court would consider this matter because the Ohio Supreme Court has\npreviously adopted the directness requirement precedent of the United States Supreme\nCourt. See Savedoff, 524 F.3d at 762 (when a state’s highest court has not addressed an\nissue, we anticipate how that court would rule). In Anza, the United States Supreme\nCourt considered the private RICO claim of the plaintiff, Ideal, which alleged that the\ndefendant, National, engaged in mail and wire fraud that led to lost sales at the plaintiff’s\nbusiness. Anza, 547 U.S. at 453. Specifically, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant\ndefrauded the New York tax authority and used the proceeds from this fraud to offer\nlower prices to its customers, which led to the plaintiff’s lower sales because Ideal and\nNational were competitors. Id. at 457-58. The Court held that the complaint did not\nsatisfy the directness requirement because the alleged violation did not lead directly to\nthe plaintiff’s injuries. Id. at 461. It reasoned: “The cause of Ideal’s asserted harms . . .\nis a set of actions (offering lower prices) entirely distinct from the alleged RICO\nviolation (defrauding the State).” Id. at 458.\n\n        Similarly, here, the cause of the alleged harms is a set of actions (neglect of\nproperty, starting fires, looting, and dealing drugs) that is completely distinct from the\nasserted misconduct (financing subprime loans). See id.; see also Canyon County v.\nSyngenta Seeds, Inc., 519 F.3d 969, 982 (9th Cir. 2008) (“Here, just as in Anza, the cause\nof the plaintiff’s asserted harms is a set of actions (increased demand by people within\nCanyon County for public health care and law enforcement services) entirely distinct\nfrom the alleged RICO violation (the defendants’ knowing hiring of undocumented\nworkers).”). This lack of directness exposes “the difficulty that can arise when a court\nattempts to ascertain the damages caused by some remote action.” Id. (citing Holmes,\n503 U.S. at 269 (“[T]he less direct an injury is, the more difficult it becomes to ascertain\nthe amount of a plaintiff’s damages attributable to the violation, as distinct from other,\nindependent, factors.”)).\n\n        Just as in Anza, “[t]his conclusion is confirmed by considering the directness\nrequirement’s underlying premises.” Id. Of the three Holmes factors, the first and third\nfactors are squarely implicated by the facts alleged in the complaint. We begin with an\n\fNo. 09-3608          City of Cleveland v. Ameriquest Mortgage                       Page 12\n                     Securities, et al.\n\n\nanalysis of the first factor, which states that indirectness adds to the difficulty of\ndetermining which damages can be attributed to the defendant’s misconduct. See\nBeretta, 768 N.E.2d at 1148 (summarizing the first Holmes factor). Again, Anza\nprovides a useful comparison. In Anza, the Court noted that “[t]he injury Ideal alleges\nis its own loss of sales resulting from National’s decreased prices for cash-paying\ncustomers. National, however, could have lowered its prices for any number of reasons\nunconnected to the asserted pattern of fraud.” Anza, 547 U.S. at 458-59 (emphasis\nadded).\n\n          Likewise, in this case, the injuries that Cleveland alleges could have been caused\nby many other factors unconnected to the Defendants’ conduct. Companies that sold\nmortgages to home buyers decided which loans should be made and on what conditions.\nAlthough the complaint alleges that the Defendants sometimes dictated which types of\nloans to make, these companies ultimately made the decisions regarding where they\nwould seek financing, which types of loans they would market and sell, and, once the\nmortgagee, whether to keep the mortgage or sell it to another buyer, such as one of the\nDefendants. Moreover, home buyers chose to enter into a subprime mortgage and to\ndefault on their loans. And, once the mortgagor defaulted, the mortgagee or his assigns\nchose to begin the foreclosure process. These voluntary choices were made for a variety\nof reasons unrelated to the Defendants.\n\n          The alleged damages that subsequently occurred—eyesores, fires, drug deals, and\nlooting—were also not directly caused by the Defendants. Homeowners, whether the\ninitial buyers or mortgagees that later took possession of a home, were responsible for\nmaintaining their properties. Fires were likely started by negligent or malicious\nindividuals or occurred because a home was poorly built. Drug dealers and looters made\nindependent decisions to engage in that criminal conduct. Additionally, other companies\nnot listed in the complaint financed subprime loans and properties not subject to a\nsubprime loan nevertheless entered into foreclosure. Similar to Holmes and Anza,\nCleveland has not stated a viable claim when these actions could have occurred for “any\nnumber of reasons unconnected to the asserted pattern of [misconduct].” Id. at 458.\n\fNo. 09-3608             City of Cleveland v. Ameriquest Mortgage                                    Page 13\n                        Securities, et al.\n\n\n         The involvement of so many independent actors also reveals why Cleveland’s\nreliance on Beretta is misplaced. In that case, the Ohio Supreme Court allowed a lawsuit\nagainst handgun manufacturers, brought under numerous theories of liability including\npublic nuisance, to proceed past the motion to dismiss stage. Beretta, 768 N.E.2d at\n1140. But, in Beretta, the plaintiffs accused the defendants of creating and supplying\nan illegal firearms market in Cincinnati through their marketing, distribution, and selling\nof firearms. Id. at 1143. By contrast, the complaint concedes that, for the most part, the\nDefendants did not directly make subprime loans to the homeowners of Cleveland. The\nDefendants are instead accused of financing a legal market for these loans. Thus, for\nBeretta to be analogous to the instant case, the Ohio Supreme Court would have had to\nallow a suit against the banks that provided financing to the gun manufacturers that\nallegedly created the illegal secondary market.                   Because there is another set of\nindependent actors between the alleged misconduct and the alleged injury, the proximate\ncause holding in that case does not logically extend to this one.6\n\n         Another similar reason that the complaint does not satisfy the directness\nrequirement, which also touches on the concerns implicated by the first Holmes factor,\nis that the remote connection between the alleged misconduct and the alleged injury\nmakes it impossible “to ascertain the amount of [Cleveland’s] damages attributable to\nthe violation.” See Holmes, 503 U.S. at 269. The Court’s reasoning in Anza is once\nmore instructive:\n\n                 There is, in addition, a second discontinuity between the RICO\n         violation and the asserted injury. Ideal’s lost sales could have resulted\n         from factors other than petitioners’ alleged acts of fraud. Businesses lose\n         and gain customers for many reasons, and it would require a complex\n         assessment to establish what portion of Ideal’s lost sales were the product\n         of National’s decreased prices. . . . The attenuated connection between\n         Ideal’s injury and the Anzas’ injurious conduct thus implicates\n         fundamental concerns expressed in Holmes.\n\n\n\n         6\n          Although not relevant to the directness requirement, there is at least one other critical difference\nbetween this case and Beretta. The complaint in Beretta accused the defendants of financing an illegal\nmarket for guns, whereas, here, the Defendants allegedly financed a legal subprime mortgage market.\n\fNo. 09-3608        City of Cleveland v. Ameriquest Mortgage                      Page 14\n                   Securities, et al.\n\n\nAnza, 547 U.S. at 459 (internal citations omitted).\n\n       Just as in Anza, this case “implicates fundamental concerns expressed in\nHolmes.” Id. A “complex assessment” would be needed to determine which municipal\nexpenditures increased and tax revenues decreased because of the ills caused by\nforeclosed homes rather than, inter alia, job losses due to the decline in manufacturing,\nfickle consumer tastes, deteriorating schools, a national recession, or increases in crime\nnot related to foreclosures. Id. Cleveland points to many of these factors in its brief to\ndemonstrate why the Defendants should have known to avoid financing subprime loans\nin Cleveland, but these same reasons make it impossible for Cleveland to plead\nproximate cause under Ohio law. See id. (“Further illustrating this point is the\nspeculative nature of the proceedings that would follow if Ideal were permitted to\nmaintain its claim.”); see also Canyon County, 519 F.3d at 983 (“The causal chain would\nalso be difficult to ascertain because there are numerous alternative causes that might be\nthe actual source or sources of the County’s alleged harm.”).\n\n       Finally, Cleveland’s claim fails because, in accordance with Holmes’s third\nfactor, more immediate victims can sue to the extent that the Defendants violated any\nlaws. See Anza, 547 U.S. at 460 (“The requirement of a direct causal connection is\nespecially warranted where the immediate victims . . . can be expected to vindicate the\nlaws by pursuing their own claims.”). The Supreme Court explained in Anza that when\nthe adjudication of another party’s claim would be “relatively straightforward” and\n“considerably easier,” “[t]here is no need to broaden the universe of actionable harms\nto permit . . . suits by parties who have been injured only indirectly.” Id. Here, a suit\nbrought by a mortgagor whose home has been foreclosed on would be “relatively\nstraighforward” and damages would be “considerably easier” to calculate because the\nmortgagor could limit his suit to the the specific Defendants that financed his subprime\nloan or loans. Additionally, other home owners who were injured because their\nneighborhood declined due to foreclosed homes, while not necessarily immediate\nvictims, are closer in the alleged chain of causation than Cleveland. It would be easier\nto calculate the damages suffered by property owners in a specific neighborhood, where\n\fNo. 09-3608        City of Cleveland v. Ameriquest Mortgage                    Page 15\n                   Securities, et al.\n\n\nthe court could more readily ascertain how many foreclosures occurred and what caused\nthem, than to calculate the damages to the whole city of Cleveland. And, to the extent\nthat misconduct occurred when the Defendants sold mortgages to create mortgage-\nbacked securities, the buyers of these securities can bring their own causes of action.\nThese other potential claims obviate the need for this court to allow Cleveland’s claim\nto proceed.\n\n       In sum, even when viewing the assertions in the complaint in a light most\nfavorable to Cleveland, the connection between the alleged harm and the alleged\nmisconduct is too indirect to warrant recovery. Although the facts are different than\nthose before the Supreme Court in Holmes and Anza, the same directness concerns are\nimplicated.\n\n                                   III. Conclusion\n\n       Our proximate cause holding clearly resolves this case, and we therefore do not\nneed to address the district court’s remaining reasons for dismissing the complaint.\nAccordingly, we AFFIRM.\n\f",

On appeal, Cleveland initially contends that the district court erred when it refused to remand this suit to Ohio state court. It also appeals, on the merits, the district court's four independent reasons for dismissing this suit pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure: (1) preemption, (2) the economic loss rule, (3) unreasonable interference of a public right, and (4) proximate cause. The district court considered each reason to be dispositive in favor of all Defendants. For the reasons that follow, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. Background</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Factual Background</h2>\n<p>In its complaint, Cleveland acknowledges that, for the most part, the Defendants did not originate the subprime mortgages at issue in this appeal. Nevertheless, it alleges that the Defendants' financing, purchasing, and pooling of vast amounts of these loans, to create mortgage-backed securities to sell to their customers, constituted a public nuisance. Cleveland puts forward the following factual pattern to support its claim:</p>\n<blockquote>(1) Wall Street made cash available to subprime lenders, which (2) used the funds to make subprime loans to consumers, then (3) sold the related mortgages back to the same cadre of Wall Street, which (4) packaged them and sold the income they generated to investors in the form of mortgage-backed securities, and (5) used the proceeds to repeat the process.</blockquote>\n<p>Cleveland maintains that, beginning in 2003, the Defendants became more brazen in their lending activities and began to direct lenders on the types of loans to issue to meet the Defendants' securitization needs. These pressures \"subverted the normal operation of the mortgage market and inevitably led to the abandonment of meaningful underwriting standards.\" Because of growth in the real-estate market, the Defendants ignored these issues and turned a blind-eye even when loans made no economic sense. The complaint concludes that these \"securitizers\" were principally responsible for the financial crisis.</p>\n<p>Cleveland alleges that the factors that led to the housing bubble never materialized in Cleveland because of its high rate of poverty, sluggish job market, struggling Rust-Belt economy, declining manufacturing sector, sparse housing demand, and difficulty fostering new industries. Cleveland's unique economic plight and its stagnant housing market made mass foreclosures the foreseeable and inevitable result of the subprime financing provided by the Defendants. The Defendants knew about these unique issues but nevertheless continued to finance subprime mortgages in Cleveland. These activities led to thousands of foreclosed homes in neighborhoods throughout Cleveland that became \"eyesores, fire hazards, and easy prey for looters and drug dealers in search of a place to conduct their business.\"</p>\n<p>Cleveland claims that each foreclosure creates tangible costs for the city, including increased expenditures for fire and police protection and maintenance and demolition costs. Tax revenues also plummeted because of the decline in housing values due to the foreclosed homes. Cleveland seeks to recover millions in municipal expenditures and diminished tax revenues as damages.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Procedural Background</h2>\n<p>Cleveland filed suit on January 10, 2008, in the Court of Common Pleas for Cuyahoga County, Ohio. It brought a single claim of public nuisance against twenty-one <span class=\"star-pagination\">*500</span> defendantssome of which are current Defendants. Asserting diversity of citizenship, Lehman Brothers Holdings, Inc. (\"Lehman Brothers\"),<sup>[2]</sup> removed the suit to the Northern District of Ohio on January 16, 2008. Cleveland moved the next day to remand the case to state court. It argued that Lehman Brothers's removal was improper because Lehman Brothers was required to either obtain the unanimous consent of all of the defendants before removing the case or explain in its Notice of Removal why it did not pursue this course of action. All of the defendants joined a motion opposing the motion to remand shortly thereafter. After supplemental briefing and oral argument, the district court denied Cleveland's motion to remand on August 8, 2008. <i>City of Cleveland v. Deutsche Bank Trust Co.,</i> 571 F.Supp.2d 807 (N.D.Ohio 2008).</p>\n<p>Subsequently, Cleveland filed a new public nuisance claim in state court. It made allegations similar to those found in the original complaint but brought the suit against some new defendants and some affiliates of the original defendants. For example, Countrywide Financial Corp. was a defendant in the original suit, but Cleveland sued Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. and Countrywide Securities Corp. in its new state court suit. A Joint Motion for Entry of Agreed Order Regarding Plaintiff's Motion for Leave to Amend (\"Joint Motion\") was then agreed to,<sup>[3]</sup> which the district court approved. The Joint Motion was intended \"to resolve the disagreement that has arisen between the parties and to avoid protracted litigation....\" <i>City of Cleveland v. Deutsche Bank Trust Co.,</i> No. 1:08-CV-00139 (N.D.Ohio September 29, 2008) (order approving Joint Motion). Among other things, it limited which defendants Cleveland could sue. Afterwards, Cleveland filed its Second Amended complaint in federal courtthe complaint at issue in this appealagainst the current Defendants.</p>\n<p>Defendants filed eight separate motions to dismisssome individually and some collectively. The district court dismissed the complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) on May 15, 2009, for four independent reasons. <i>City of Cleveland v. Ameriquest Mortg. Sec., Inc.,</i> 621 F.Supp.2d 513 (N.D.Ohio 2009). First, the court held that Ohio Rev.Code § 1.63, an Ohio state law that forbids municipalities from engaging in mortgage regulation, preempted Cleveland's public nuisance claim. <i>Id.</i> at 520. Second, the court held that Ohio's economic loss rule barred Cleveland's claim. <i>Id.</i> at 526. Third, the court held that subprime lending cannot form the basis of a public nuisance claim because it is legal, and that, by extension, funding subprime lending also cannot be a public nuisance. <i>Id.</i> at 531. Fourth, the court held that the assertions in Cleveland's complaint were insufficient to satisfy the directness requirement of proximate cause because its allegations did not \"demonstrate any direct relationship between its alleged injury and [the] Defendants' conduct.\" <i>Id.</i> at 533. The court declined to rule on the other four motions because it found its rulings on the four issues it considered to be dispositive for all of the Defendants. <i>Id.</i> at 516. Cleveland appeals.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. Analysis</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Motion to Remand</h2>\n<p>Cleveland argues that the district court should have remanded this case <span class=\"star-pagination\">*501</span> to Ohio court because the Defendants' removal was defective. However, Cleveland waived its right to pursue this issue on appeal because the Joint Motion contained a clause that stated: \"Plaintiff shall prosecute the public nuisance claim against the Eliminated Defendants and the Amended Defendants, if at all, exclusively in this Court and as part of this case....\"<sup>[4]</sup> It is well-established that the waiver of a party's right to removal must be clear and unequivocal. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Cadle Co. v. Reiner, Reiner &amp; Bendett, P.C.,</i> 307 Fed.Appx. 884, 886 (6th Cir.2009). Further, \"[g]eneral principles of contract interpretation apply when determining whether a clause explicitly waives the right of removal.\" <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>In re Delta Am. Re Ins. Co.,</i> 900 F.2d 890, 892 (6th Cir.1990)).</p>\n<p>Here, there is no plausible way to read this language as anything other than a clear and unequivocal waiver of Cleveland's right to further pursue its motion to remand on appeal, and Cleveland neither contests the validity of the Joint Motion nor suggests an alternative reading of this clause.<sup>[5]</sup> Instead, Cleveland contends that, despite the express language in the Joint Motion, it did not waive its right to appeal this ruling because it made a tactical decision based on time and money to enter into the agreement. These reasons are inadequate to void the agreement under the general principles of contract law. Therefore, the Joint Motion precludes Cleveland from now arguing that the district court should have remanded this suit, and the district court properly permitted this case to proceed in federal court.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, even if we ignore the Joint Motion, the district court still properly declined to remand this case. We review a district court's refusal to remand de novo. <i>Harper v. AutoAlliance Int'l, Inc.,</i> 392 F.3d 195, 200 (6th Cir.2004). Cleveland argues that the district court's ruling did not conform with the rule of unanimity. The \"rule of unanimity demands that all defendants must join in a petition to remove a state case to federal court.\" <i>Loftis v. United Parcel Serv., Inc.,</i> 342 F.3d 509, 516 (6th Cir.2003). This circuit has identified at least three ways to satisfy this rule: all parties that have been served or otherwise properly joined may (1) join in the removal, (2) file a written consent to removal, or (3) oppose a motion to remand. <i>Brierly v. Alusuisse Flexible Packaging, Inc.,</i> 184 F.3d 527, 533 n. 3 (6th Cir.1999) (the first two options); <i>Harper,</i> 392 F.3d at 202 (the third option). The Defendants met two of these conditions. First, after Lehman Brothers filed its notice of removal on January 16, 2008, each Defendant filed a consent to removal, the last of which was filed February 1, 2008, within the thirty day period. Second, after Cleveland filed its motion to remand on January 17, 2008, all of the Defendants opposed Cleveland's motion to remand on February 1, 2008, also within the thirty day period.</p>\n<p>We note that Cleveland has waived its argument that the rule of unanimity was violated because Bear Stearns's consent <span class=\"star-pagination\">*502</span> to removal was invalid. At oral argument, Cleveland conceded that it had purposefully waited to raise this argument until oral argument for its motion to remand, while believing that its general motion for remand would allow it to challenge Bear Stearns's consent after thirty days. Cleveland employed this suspect approach despite indicating in its Reply Brief in Support of Motion for Remand, filed on February 8, 2008, that \"[a]ll of the defendants did eventually give their consent to removal.\" Because the argument raised by Cleveland at oral argument is inconsistent with the arguments it made during the thirty day period, it has waived its objection to Bear Stearns's consent. <i>See </i><i>Mellon v. Int'l Shoe Co.,</i> 32 F.2d 390, 391 (D.Mass.1929) (\"This action was entirely inconsistent with the position taken in the motion to remand, and, having been done without any reservation of rights under the motion, had the effect of waiving the motion.\"). In any case, Bear Stearns also joined the opposition to remand, as did all of the Defendants, and this action alone was sufficient to satisfy the rule of unanimity.</p>\n<p>Thus, we now turn to the district court's dismissal of this suit pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6). For the sake of judicial efficiency, we begin, and end, our analysis with the district court's proximate cause ruling.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Standard of Review</h2>\n<p>We review de novo the district court's dismissal pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6). <i>Mezibov v. Allen,</i> 411 F.3d 712, 716 (6th Cir.2005). We construe the complaint in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party and accept all plausible well-pled factual allegations as true. <i>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly,</i> 550 U.S. 544, 556, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007), and <i>Commercial Money Ctr., Inc. v. Ill. Union Ins. Co.,</i> 508 F.3d 327, 336 (6th Cir.2007). \"To state a valid claim, a complaint must contain direct or inferential allegations respecting all the material elements under some viable legal theory.\" <i>Id.</i> at 336-37 (citing <i>Mezibov,</i> 411 F.3d at 716).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. Applicable Law</h2>\n<p>Because this suit is before us pursuant to our diversity jurisdiction, we apply the substantive law of Ohio and federal procedural law. <i>Biegas v. Quickway Carriers, Inc.,</i> 573 F.3d 365, 374 (6th Cir. 2009). When applying the substantive law of Ohio, we must \"follow the decisions of the state's highest court when that court has addressed the relevant issue.\" <i>Savedoff v. Access Group, Inc.,</i> 524 F.3d 754, 762 (6th Cir.2008) (quoting <i>Talley v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co.,</i> 223 F.3d 323, 326 (6th Cir.2000)). \"If the issue has not been directly addressed, we must `anticipate how the relevant state's highest court would rule in the case and are bound by controlling decisions of that court.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>In re Dow Corning Corp.,</i> 419 F.3d 543, 549 (6th Cir.2005)).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. Proximate Cause</h2>\n<p>Cleveland argues that its complaint alleged facts sufficient to satisfy the directness requirement. The directness requirement \"requires some direct relation between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged.\" <i>Holmes v. Sec. Investor Prot. Corp.,</i> 503 U.S. 258, 268, 112 S.Ct. 1311, 117 L.Ed.2d 532 (1992). Although not the sole element, the requirement of a direct injury is a \"central element\" of proximate cause. <i>Perry v. Am. Tobacco Co.,</i> 324 F.3d 845, 848 (6th Cir. 2003). Notably, this requirement is distinct from foreseeability and applies even if the Defendants intentionally caused the alleged course of events. <i>Id.</i> at 850. Accordingly, although Cleveland asserts that the Defendants knew about the consequences <span class=\"star-pagination\">*503</span> of subprime lending, this allegation is not relevant to our directness requirement analysis.</p>\n<p><i>Holmes</i> is the seminal United States Supreme Court decision that discusses the directness requirement, and the Ohio Supreme Court has adopted the <i>Holmes</i> Court's proximate cause analysis. <i>Cincinnati v. Beretta U.S.A. Corp.,</i> 95 Ohio St.3d 416, 768 N.E.2d 1136, 1148-49 (2002). <i>Holmes</i> is therefore the focus of our directness requirement analysis. In <i>Holmes,</i> the plaintiff, Securities Investor Protection Corporation (\"SIPC\"), brought suit against several defendants under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\"RICO\"). <i>Holmes,</i> 503 U.S. at 262, 112 S.Ct. 1311. SIPC alleged that these defendants conspired to fraudulently manipulate stocks, which led to the insolvency of two securities broker-dealers. <i>Id.</i> at 261, 112 S.Ct. 1311. As a result, the broker-dealers failed to satisfy their financial obligations to their customers, and SIPC, a provider of insurance to bankrupt broker-dealers that could no longer pay their customers, was forced to cover the broker-dealers' debts. <i>Id.</i> at 262-63, 112 S.Ct. 1311. SIPC sued for reimbursement, but the Court declined to find liability because \"the link [was] too remote between the stock manipulation alleged and the customers' harm, being purely contingent on the harm suffered by the broker-dealers.\" <i>Id.</i> at 271, 112 S.Ct. 1311.</p>\n<p>In <i>Beretta,</i> the Ohio Supreme Court summarized the three reasons given in <i>Holmes</i> for a directness requirement:</p>\n<blockquote>(1) indirectness adds to the difficulty in determining which of the plaintiff's damages can be attributed to the defendant's misconduct, (2) recognizing the claims of the indirectly injured would complicate the apportionment of damages among plaintiffs to avoid multiple recoveries, and (3) these complications are unwarranted given the availability of other parties who are directly injured and who can remedy the harm without these associated problems.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Beretta,</i> 768 N.E.2d at 1148 (citing <i>Holmes,</i> 503 U.S. at 269-70, 112 S.Ct. 1311). The United States Supreme Court has since noted that these factors in Holmes are relevant to determine whether a plaintiff has sufficiently pleaded proximate cause, but all three factors do not need to be present for remoteness to bar recovery. <i>Anza v. Ideal Steel Supply Corp.,</i> 547 U.S. 451, 459, 126 S.Ct. 1991, 164 L.Ed.2d 720 (2006) (noting that the second factor was not implicated yet still holding that the plaintiff had failed to sufficiently allege proximate cause).</p>\n<p>As an initial matter, Cleveland contends that the district court's proximate cause analysis at the motion to dismiss stage was premature. As support, it cites this court's decision in <i>Trollinger v. Tyson Foods, Inc.,</i> 370 F.3d 602 (6th Cir.2004). In that case, former employees of a poultry plant sued under RICO, and alleged that the defendant, the poultry plant owner, schemed with employment agencies to depress wages by hiring illegal immigrants. <i>Id.</i> We refrained from engaging in a proximate cause analysis at the pleadings stage because we perceived that the analysis would be too speculative. <i>Id.</i> at 619. However, contrary to Cleveland's suggestions otherwise, there is no per se rule against dismissing a complaint for failure to adequately plead proximate cause. In fact, subsequent to <i>Trollinger,</i> the Supreme Court dismissed the complaint in <i>Anza</i> at the motion to dismiss stage for failure to plead proximate cause. <i>See </i><i>Anza,</i> 547 U.S. at 453, 126 S.Ct. 1991. Cleveland still has an obligation to file a complaint that is \"plausible on its face.\" <i>Bell,</i> 550 U.S. at 556, 127 S.Ct. 1955. Accordingly, we, just as the Supreme Court <span class=\"star-pagination\">*504</span> in <i>Anza,</i> proceed to the question of whether the complaint sufficiently pleaded proximate cause and, specifically, whether the allegations in the complaint satisfy the directness requirement.</p>\n<p>For the purposes of answering this question, the Supreme Court's application of <i>Holmes</i> in its subsequent decision <i>Anza</i> is instructive and consistent with how we believe the Ohio Supreme Court would consider this matter because the Ohio Supreme Court has previously adopted the directness requirement precedent of the United States Supreme Court. <i>See </i><i>Savedoff,</i> 524 F.3d at 762 (when a state's highest court has not addressed an issue, we anticipate how that court would rule). In <i>Anza,</i> the United States Supreme Court considered the private RICO claim of the plaintiff, Ideal, which alleged that the defendant, National, engaged in mail and wire fraud that led to lost sales at the plaintiff's business. <i>Anza,</i> 547 U.S. at 453, 126 S.Ct. 1991. Specifically, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant defrauded the New York tax authority and used the proceeds from this fraud to offer lower prices to its customers, which led to the plaintiff's lower sales because Ideal and National were competitors. <i>Id.</i> at 457-58, 126 S.Ct. 1991. The Court held that the complaint did not satisfy the directness requirement because the alleged violation did not lead directly to the plaintiff's injuries. <i>Id.</i> at 461, 126 S.Ct. 1991. It reasoned: \"The cause of Ideal's asserted harms ... is a set of actions (offering lower prices) entirely distinct from the alleged RICO violation (defrauding the State).\" <i>Id.</i> at 458, 126 S.Ct. 1991.</p>\n<p>Similarly, here, the cause of the alleged harms is a set of actions (neglect of property, starting fires, looting, and dealing drugs) that is completely distinct from the asserted misconduct (financing subprime loans). <i>See id.; see also </i><i>Canyon County v. Syngenta Seeds, Inc.,</i> 519 F.3d 969, 982 (9th Cir.2008) (\"Here, just as in <i>Anza,</i> the cause of the plaintiff's asserted harms is a set of actions (increased demand by people within Canyon County for public health care and law enforcement services) entirely distinct from the alleged RICO violation (the defendants' knowing hiring of undocumented workers).\"). This lack of directness exposes \"the difficulty that can arise when a court attempts to ascertain the damages caused by some remote action.\" <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>Holmes,</i> 503 U.S. at 269, 112 S.Ct. 1311 (\"[T]he less direct an injury is, the more difficult it becomes to ascertain the amount of a plaintiff's damages attributable to the violation, as distinct from other, independent, factors.\")).</p>\n<p>Just as in <i>Anza,</i> \"[t]his conclusion is confirmed by considering the directness requirement's underlying premises.\" <i>Id.</i> Of the three <i>Holmes</i> factors, the first and third factors are squarely implicated by the facts alleged in the complaint. We begin with an analysis of the first factor, which states that indirectness adds to the difficulty of determining which damages can be attributed to the defendant's misconduct. <i>See </i><i>Beretta,</i> 768 N.E.2d at 1148 (summarizing the first <i>Holmes</i> factor). Again, <i>Anza</i> provides a useful comparison. In <i>Anza,</i> the Court noted that \"[t]he injury Ideal alleges is its own loss of sales resulting from National's decreased prices for cash-paying customers. National, however, could have lowered its prices <i>for any number of reasons unconnected to the asserted pattern of fraud.</i>\" <i>Anza,</i> 547 U.S. at 458-59, 126 S.Ct. 1991 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>Likewise, in this case, the injuries that Cleveland alleges could have been caused by many other factors unconnected to the Defendants' conduct. Companies that sold mortgages to home buyers decided which loans should be made and on what conditions. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*505</span> Although the complaint alleges that the Defendants sometimes dictated which types of loans to make, these companies ultimately made the decisions regarding where they would seek financing, which types of loans they would market and sell, and, once the mortgagee, whether to keep the mortgage or sell it to another buyer, such as one of the Defendants. Moreover, home buyers chose to enter into a subprime mortgage and to default on their loans. And, once the mortgagor defaulted, the mortgagee or his assigns chose to begin the foreclosure process. These voluntary choices were made for a variety of reasons unrelated to the Defendants.</p>\n<p>The alleged damages that subsequently occurredeyesores, fires, drug deals, and lootingwere also not directly caused by the Defendants. Homeowners, whether the initial buyers or mortgagees that later took possession of a home, were responsible for maintaining their properties. Fires were likely started by negligent or malicious individuals or occurred because a home was poorly built. Drug dealers and looters made independent decisions to engage in that criminal conduct. Additionally, other companies not listed in the complaint financed subprime loans and properties not subject to a subprime loan nevertheless entered into foreclosure. Similar to <i>Holmes</i> and <i>Anza,</i> Cleveland has not stated a viable claim when these actions could have occurred for \"any number of reasons unconnected to the asserted pattern of [misconduct].\" <i>Id.</i> at 458, 126 S.Ct. 1991.</p>\n<p>The involvement of so many independent actors also reveals why Cleveland's reliance on <i>Beretta</i> is misplaced. In that case, the Ohio Supreme Court allowed a lawsuit against handgun manufacturers, brought under numerous theories of liability including public nuisance, to proceed past the motion to dismiss stage. <i>Beretta,</i> 768 N.E.2d at 1140. But, in <i>Beretta,</i> the plaintiffs accused the defendants of creating and supplying an illegal firearms market in Cincinnati through their marketing, distribution, and selling of firearms. <i>Id.</i> at 1143. By contrast, the complaint concedes that, for the most part, the Defendants did not directly make subprime loans to the homeowners of Cleveland. The Defendants are instead accused of financing a legal market for these loans. Thus, for <i>Beretta</i> to be analogous to the instant case, the Ohio Supreme Court would have had to allow a suit against the banks that provided financing to the gun manufacturers that allegedly created the illegal secondary market. Because there is another set of independent actors between the alleged misconduct and the alleged injury, the proximate cause holding in that case does not logically extend to this one.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>Another similar reason that the complaint does not satisfy the directness requirement, which also touches on the concerns implicated by the first <i>Holmes</i> factor, is that the remote connection between the alleged misconduct and the alleged injury makes it impossible \"to ascertain the amount of [Cleveland's] damages attributable to the violation.\" <i>See </i><i>Holmes,</i> 503 U.S. at 269, 112 S.Ct. 1311. The Court's reasoning in <i>Anza</i> is once more instructive:</p>\n<blockquote>There is, in addition, a second discontinuity between the RICO violation and the asserted injury. Ideal's lost sales could have resulted from factors other than petitioners' alleged acts of fraud. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*506</span> Businesses lose and gain customers for many reasons, and it would require a complex assessment to establish what portion of Ideal's lost sales were the product of National's decreased prices.... The attenuated connection between Ideal's injury and the Anzas' injurious conduct thus implicates fundamental concerns expressed in <i>Holmes.</i>\n</blockquote>\n<p><i>Anza,</i> 547 U.S. at 459, 126 S.Ct. 1991 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p>Just as in <i>Anza,</i> this case \"implicates fundamental concerns expressed in <i>Holmes.</i>\" <i>Id.</i> A \"complex assessment\" would be needed to determine which municipal expenditures increased and tax revenues decreased because of the ills caused by foreclosed homes rather than, <i>inter alia,</i> job losses due to the decline in manufacturing, fickle consumer tastes, deteriorating schools, a national recession, or increases in crime not related to foreclosures. <i>Id.</i> Cleveland points to many of these factors in its brief to demonstrate why the Defendants should have known to avoid financing subprime loans in Cleveland, but these same reasons make it impossible for Cleveland to plead proximate cause under Ohio law. <i>See id.</i> (\"Further illustrating this point is the speculative nature of the proceedings that would follow if Ideal were permitted to maintain its claim.\"); <i>see also </i><i>Canyon County,</i> 519 F.3d at 983 (\"The causal chain would also be difficult to ascertain because there are numerous alternative causes that might be the actual source or sources of the County's alleged harm.\").</p>\n<p>Finally, Cleveland's claim fails because, in accordance with <i>Holmes's</i> third factor, more immediate victims can sue to the extent that the Defendants violated any laws. <i>See </i><i>Anza,</i> 547 U.S. at 460, 126 S.Ct. 1991 (\"The requirement of a direct causal connection is especially warranted where the immediate victims ... can be expected to vindicate the laws by pursuing their own claims.\"). The Supreme Court explained in <i>Anza</i> that when the adjudication of another party's claim would be \"relatively straightforward\" and \"considerably easier,\" \"[t]here is no need to broaden the universe of actionable harms to permit ... suits by parties who have been injured only indirectly.\" <i>Id.</i> Here, a suit brought by a mortgagor whose home has been foreclosed on would be \"relatively straightforward\" and damages would be \"considerably easier\" to calculate because the mortgagor could limit his suit to the specific Defendants that financed his subprime loan or loans. Additionally, other home owners who were injured because their neighborhood declined due to foreclosed homes, while not necessarily immediate victims, are closer in the alleged chain of causation than Cleveland. It would be easier to calculate the damages suffered by property owners in a specific neighborhood, where the court could more readily ascertain how many foreclosures occurred and what caused them, than to calculate the damages to the whole city of Cleveland. And, to the extent that misconduct occurred when the Defendants sold mortgages to create mortgage-backed securities, the buyers of these securities can bring their own causes of action. These other potential claims obviate the need for this court to allow Cleveland's claim to proceed.</p>\n<p>In sum, even when viewing the assertions in the complaint in a light most favorable to Cleveland, the connection between the alleged harm and the alleged misconduct is too indirect to warrant recovery. Although the facts are different than those before the Supreme Court in <i>Holmes</i> and <i>Anza,</i> the same directness concerns are implicated.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*507</span> III. Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Our proximate cause holding clearly resolves this case, and we therefore do not need to address the district court's remaining reasons for dismissing the complaint. Accordingly, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  In Ohio, a public nuisance is defined as \"an unreasonable interference with a right common to the general public.\" <i>Cincinnati v. Beretta U.S.A. Corp.,</i> 95 Ohio St.3d 416, 768 N.E.2d 1136, 1142 (2002) (quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts § 821B(1)).</p>\n<p>[2]  Lehman Brothers is no longer a Defendant.</p>\n<p>[3]  Cleveland entered into a separate agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and Wells Fargo Asset Securities Corporation, where it also agreed to pursue all claims \"in federal court in the federal nuisance action.\" GMAC-RFC was not a party to the Joint Motion.</p>\n<p>[4]  All of the current Defendants were parties in the Joint Motion and were listed as either Amended Defendants or Eliminated Defendants, except for GMAC-RFC. GMAC-RFC was not a party to the Joint Motion, and was neither an Amended Defendant nor an Eliminated Defendant.</p>\n<p>[5]  Cleveland could have contested the effect of the Joint Motion on its claim against GMACRFC. However, Cleveland has not made this argument in its briefs or at oral argument, so it is waived. <i>See </i><i>Farm Labor Org. Comm. v. Ohio State Highway Patrol,</i> 308 F.3d 523, 544 n. 8 (6th Cir.2002) (\"It is well established that an issue not raised in a party's briefs on appeal may be deemed waived.\").</p>\n<p>[6]  Although not relevant to the directness requirement, there is at least one other critical difference between this case and <i>Beretta.</i> The complaint in <i>Beretta</i> accused the defendants of financing an <i>illegal</i> market for guns, whereas, here, the Defendants allegedly financed a <i>legal</i> subprime mortgage market.</p>\n\n</div>",

On appeal, Cleveland initially contends that the district court erred when it refused to remand this suit to Ohio state court. It also appeals, on the merits, the district court's four independent reasons for dismissing this suit pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure: (1) preemption, (2) the economic loss rule, (3) unreasonable interference of a public right, and (4) proximate cause. The district court considered each reason to be dispositive in favor of all Defendants. For the reasons that follow, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. Background</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Factual Background</h2>\n<p>In its complaint, Cleveland acknowledges that, for the most part, the Defendants did not originate the subprime mortgages at issue in this appeal. Nevertheless, it alleges that the Defendants' financing, purchasing, and pooling of vast amounts of these loans, to create mortgage-backed securities to sell to their customers, constituted a public nuisance. Cleveland puts forward the following factual pattern to support its claim:</p>\n<blockquote>(1) Wall Street made cash available to subprime lenders, which (2) used the funds to make subprime loans to consumers, then (3) sold the related mortgages back to the same cadre of Wall Street, which (4) packaged them and sold the income they generated to investors in the form of mortgage-backed securities, and (5) used the proceeds to repeat the process.</blockquote>\n<p>Cleveland maintains that, beginning in 2003, the Defendants became more brazen in their lending activities and began to direct lenders on the types of loans to issue to meet the Defendants' securitization needs. These pressures \"subverted the normal operation of the mortgage market and inevitably led to the abandonment of meaningful underwriting standards.\" Because of growth in the real-estate market, the Defendants ignored these issues and turned a blind-eye even when loans made no economic sense. The complaint concludes that these \"securitizers\" were principally responsible for the financial crisis.</p>\n<p>Cleveland alleges that the factors that led to the housing bubble never materialized in Cleveland because of its high rate of poverty, sluggish job market, struggling Rust-Belt economy, declining manufacturing sector, sparse housing demand, and difficulty fostering new industries. Cleveland's unique economic plight and its stagnant housing market made mass foreclosures the foreseeable and inevitable result of the subprime financing provided by the Defendants. The Defendants knew about these unique issues but nevertheless continued to finance subprime mortgages in Cleveland. These activities led to thousands of foreclosed homes in neighborhoods throughout Cleveland that became \"eyesores, fire hazards, and easy prey for looters and drug dealers in search of a place to conduct their business.\"</p>\n<p>Cleveland claims that each foreclosure creates tangible costs for the city, including increased expenditures for fire and police protection and maintenance and demolition costs. Tax revenues also plummeted because of the decline in housing values due to the foreclosed homes. Cleveland seeks to recover millions in municipal expenditures and diminished tax revenues as damages.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Procedural Background</h2>\n<p>Cleveland filed suit on January 10, 2008, in the Court of Common Pleas for Cuyahoga County, Ohio. It brought a single claim of public nuisance against twenty-one <span class=\"star-pagination\">*500</span> defendantssome of which are current Defendants. Asserting diversity of citizenship, Lehman Brothers Holdings, Inc. (\"Lehman Brothers\"),<sup>[2]</sup> removed the suit to the Northern District of Ohio on January 16, 2008. Cleveland moved the next day to remand the case to state court. It argued that Lehman Brothers's removal was improper because Lehman Brothers was required to either obtain the unanimous consent of all of the defendants before removing the case or explain in its Notice of Removal why it did not pursue this course of action. All of the defendants joined a motion opposing the motion to remand shortly thereafter. After supplemental briefing and oral argument, the district court denied Cleveland's motion to remand on August 8, 2008. <i>City of Cleveland v. Deutsche Bank Trust Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1494437\"><a href=\"/opinion/1494437/city-of-cleveland-v-deutsche-bank-trust-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">571</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">807</span></a></span> (N.D.Ohio 2008).</p>\n<p>Subsequently, Cleveland filed a new public nuisance claim in state court. It made allegations similar to those found in the original complaint but brought the suit against some new defendants and some affiliates of the original defendants. For example, Countrywide Financial Corp. was a defendant in the original suit, but Cleveland sued Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. and Countrywide Securities Corp. in its new state court suit. A Joint Motion for Entry of Agreed Order Regarding Plaintiff's Motion for Leave to Amend (\"Joint Motion\") was then agreed to,<sup>[3]</sup> which the district court approved. The Joint Motion was intended \"to resolve the disagreement that has arisen between the parties and to avoid protracted litigation....\" <i>City of Cleveland v. Deutsche Bank Trust Co.,</i> No. 1:08-CV-00139 (N.D.Ohio September 29, 2008) (order approving Joint Motion). Among other things, it limited which defendants Cleveland could sue. Afterwards, Cleveland filed its Second Amended complaint in federal courtthe complaint at issue in this appealagainst the current Defendants.</p>\n<p>Defendants filed eight separate motions to dismisssome individually and some collectively. The district court dismissed the complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) on May 15, 2009, for four independent reasons. <i>City of Cleveland v. Ameriquest Mortg. Sec., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1368638\"><a href=\"/opinion/1368638/city-of-cleveland-v-ameriquest-mortg-securities/\"><span class=\"volume\">621</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">513</span></a></span> (N.D.Ohio 2009). First, the court held that Ohio Rev.Code § 1.63, an Ohio state law that forbids municipalities from engaging in mortgage regulation, preempted Cleveland's public nuisance claim. <i>Id.</i> at 520. Second, the court held that Ohio's economic loss rule barred Cleveland's claim. <i>Id.</i> at 526. Third, the court held that subprime lending cannot form the basis of a public nuisance claim because it is legal, and that, by extension, funding subprime lending also cannot be a public nuisance. <i>Id.</i> at 531. Fourth, the court held that the assertions in Cleveland's complaint were insufficient to satisfy the directness requirement of proximate cause because its allegations did not \"demonstrate any direct relationship between its alleged injury and [the] Defendants' conduct.\" <i>Id.</i> at 533. The court declined to rule on the other four motions because it found its rulings on the four issues it considered to be dispositive for all of the Defendants. <i>Id.</i> at 516. Cleveland appeals.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. Analysis</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Motion to Remand</h2>\n<p>Cleveland argues that the district court should have remanded this case <span class=\"star-pagination\">*501</span> to Ohio court because the Defendants' removal was defective. However, Cleveland waived its right to pursue this issue on appeal because the Joint Motion contained a clause that stated: \"Plaintiff shall prosecute the public nuisance claim against the Eliminated Defendants and the Amended Defendants, if at all, exclusively in this Court and as part of this case....\"<sup>[4]</sup> It is well-established that the waiver of a party's right to removal must be clear and unequivocal. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Cadle Co. v. Reiner, Reiner &amp; Bendett, P.C.,</i> 307 Fed.Appx. 884, 886 (6th Cir.2009). Further, \"[g]eneral principles of contract interpretation apply when determining whether a clause explicitly waives the right of removal.\" <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>In re Delta Am. Re Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"539856\"><a href=\"/opinion/539856/in-re-delta-america-re-insurance-co-in-liquidation-leroy-morgan/\"><span class=\"volume\">900</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">890</span></a></span>, 892 (6th Cir.1990)).</p>\n<p>Here, there is no plausible way to read this language as anything other than a clear and unequivocal waiver of Cleveland's right to further pursue its motion to remand on appeal, and Cleveland neither contests the validity of the Joint Motion nor suggests an alternative reading of this clause.<sup>[5]</sup> Instead, Cleveland contends that, despite the express language in the Joint Motion, it did not waive its right to appeal this ruling because it made a tactical decision based on time and money to enter into the agreement. These reasons are inadequate to void the agreement under the general principles of contract law. Therefore, the Joint Motion precludes Cleveland from now arguing that the district court should have remanded this suit, and the district court properly permitted this case to proceed in federal court.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, even if we ignore the Joint Motion, the district court still properly declined to remand this case. We review a district court's refusal to remand de novo. <i>Harper v. AutoAlliance Int'l, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"788629\"><a href=\"/opinion/788629/derrick-e-harper-v-autoalliance-international-inc-aai-employee/\"><span class=\"volume\">392</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">195</span></a></span>, 200 (6th Cir.2004). Cleveland argues that the district court's ruling did not conform with the rule of unanimity. The \"rule of unanimity demands that all defendants must join in a petition to remove a state case to federal court.\" <i>Loftis v. United Parcel Serv., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"783435\"><a href=\"/opinion/783435/thomas-p-loftis-v-united-parcel-service-inc-david-cole-kenneth-adkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">342</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">509</span></a></span>, 516 (6th Cir.2003). This circuit has identified at least three ways to satisfy this rule: all parties that have been served or otherwise properly joined may (1) join in the removal, (2) file a written consent to removal, or (3) oppose a motion to remand. <i>Brierly v. Alusuisse Flexible Packaging, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765264\"><a href=\"/opinion/765264/jeffrey-d-brierly-administrator-of-the-estate-of-paul-brierly-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">184</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">527</span></a></span>, 533 n. 3 (6th Cir.1999) (the first two options); <i>Harper,</i> 392 F.3d at 202 (the third option). The Defendants met two of these conditions. First, after Lehman Brothers filed its notice of removal on January 16, 2008, each Defendant filed a consent to removal, the last of which was filed February 1, 2008, within the thirty day period. Second, after Cleveland filed its motion to remand on January 17, 2008, all of the Defendants opposed Cleveland's motion to remand on February 1, 2008, also within the thirty day period.</p>\n<p>We note that Cleveland has waived its argument that the rule of unanimity was violated because Bear Stearns's consent <span class=\"star-pagination\">*502</span> to removal was invalid. At oral argument, Cleveland conceded that it had purposefully waited to raise this argument until oral argument for its motion to remand, while believing that its general motion for remand would allow it to challenge Bear Stearns's consent after thirty days. Cleveland employed this suspect approach despite indicating in its Reply Brief in Support of Motion for Remand, filed on February 8, 2008, that \"[a]ll of the defendants did eventually give their consent to removal.\" Because the argument raised by Cleveland at oral argument is inconsistent with the arguments it made during the thirty day period, it has waived its objection to Bear Stearns's consent. <i>See </i><i>Mellon v. Int'l Shoe Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">32</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">390</span></span>, 391 (D.Mass.1929) (\"This action was entirely inconsistent with the position taken in the motion to remand, and, having been done without any reservation of rights under the motion, had the effect of waiving the motion.\"). In any case, Bear Stearns also joined the opposition to remand, as did all of the Defendants, and this action alone was sufficient to satisfy the rule of unanimity.</p>\n<p>Thus, we now turn to the district court's dismissal of this suit pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6). For the sake of judicial efficiency, we begin, and end, our analysis with the district court's proximate cause ruling.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B.

Proximate Cause</h2>\n<p>Cleveland argues that its complaint alleged facts sufficient to satisfy the directness requirement. The directness requirement \"requires some direct relation between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged.\" <i>Holmes v. Sec. Investor Prot. Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112708\"><a href=\"/opinion/112708/holmes-v-securities-investor-protection-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">258</span></a></span>, 268, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112708\"><a href=\"/opinion/112708/holmes-v-securities-investor-protection-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">532</span></a></span> (1992). Although not the sole element, the requirement of a direct injury is a \"central element\" of proximate cause. <i>Perry v. Am. Tobacco Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"781450\"><a href=\"/opinion/781450/gregory-bennett-perry-and-steve-lloyd-champion-on-behalf-of-themselves-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">324</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">845</span></a></span>, 848 (6th Cir. 2003). Notably, this requirement is distinct from foreseeability and applies even if the Defendants intentionally caused the alleged course of events. <i>Id.</i> at 850. Accordingly, although Cleveland asserts that the Defendants knew about the consequences <span class=\"star-pagination\">*503</span> of subprime lending, this allegation is not relevant to our directness requirement analysis.</p>\n<p><i>Holmes</i> is the seminal United States Supreme Court decision that discusses the directness requirement, and the Ohio Supreme Court has adopted the <i>Holmes</i> Court's proximate cause analysis. <i>Cincinnati v. Beretta U.S.A. Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">95</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">416</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">768</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1136</span></span>, 1148-49 (2002). <i>Holmes</i> is therefore the focus of our directness requirement analysis. In <i>Holmes,</i> the plaintiff, Securities Investor Protection Corporation (\"SIPC\"), brought suit against several defendants under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\"RICO\"). <i>Holmes,</i> 503 U.S. at 262, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112708\"><a href=\"/opinion/112708/holmes-v-securities-investor-protection-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1311</span></a></span>. SIPC alleged that these defendants conspired to fraudulently manipulate stocks, which led to the insolvency of two securities broker-dealers. <i>Id.</i> at 261, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112708\"><a href=\"/opinion/112708/holmes-v-securities-investor-protection-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1311</span></a></span>. As a result, the broker-dealers failed to satisfy their financial obligations to their customers, and SIPC, a provider of insurance to bankrupt broker-dealers that could no longer pay their customers, was forced to cover the broker-dealers' debts. <i>Id.</i> at 262-63, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112708\"><a href=\"/opinion/112708/holmes-v-securities-investor-protection-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1311</span></a></span>. SIPC sued for reimbursement, but the Court declined to find liability because \"the link [was] too remote between the stock manipulation alleged and the customers' harm, being purely contingent on the harm suffered by the broker-dealers.\" <i>Id.</i> at 271, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112708\"><a href=\"/opinion/112708/holmes-v-securities-investor-protection-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1311</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>In <i>Beretta,</i> the Ohio Supreme Court summarized the three reasons given in <i>Holmes</i> for a directness requirement:</p>\n<blockquote>(1) indirectness adds to the difficulty in determining which of the plaintiff's damages can be attributed to the defendant's misconduct, (2) recognizing the claims of the indirectly injured would complicate the apportionment of damages among plaintiffs to avoid multiple recoveries, and (3) these complications are unwarranted given the availability of other parties who are directly injured and who can remedy the harm without these associated problems.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Beretta,</i> 768 N.E.2d at 1148 (citing <i>Holmes,</i> 503 U.S. at 269-70, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112708\"><a href=\"/opinion/112708/holmes-v-securities-investor-protection-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1311</span></a></span>). The United States Supreme Court has since noted that these factors in Holmes are relevant to determine whether a plaintiff has sufficiently pleaded proximate cause, but all three factors do not need to be present for remoteness to bar recovery. <i>Anza v. Ideal Steel Supply Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145652\"><a href=\"/opinion/145652/anza-v-ideal-steel-supply-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">547</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">451</span></a></span>, 459, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145652\"><a href=\"/opinion/145652/anza-v-ideal-steel-supply-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">720</span></a></span> (2006) (noting that the second factor was not implicated yet still holding that the plaintiff had failed to sufficiently allege proximate cause).</p>\n<p>As an initial matter, Cleveland contends that the district court's proximate cause analysis at the motion to dismiss stage was premature. As support, it cites this court's decision in <i>Trollinger v. Tyson Foods, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"786425\"><a href=\"/opinion/786425/birda-trollinger-robert-martinez-tabetha-eddings-and-doris-jewell-v-tyson/\"><span class=\"volume\">370</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">602</span></a></span> (6th Cir.2004). In that case, former employees of a poultry plant sued under RICO, and alleged that the defendant, the poultry plant owner, schemed with employment agencies to depress wages by hiring illegal immigrants. <i>Id.</i> We refrained from engaging in a proximate cause analysis at the pleadings stage because we perceived that the analysis would be too speculative. <i>Id.</i> at 619. However, contrary to Cleveland's suggestions otherwise, there is no per se rule against dismissing a complaint for failure to adequately plead proximate cause. In fact, subsequent to <i>Trollinger,</i> the Supreme Court dismissed the complaint in <i>Anza</i> at the motion to dismiss stage for failure to plead proximate cause. <i>See </i><i>Anza,</i> 547 U.S. at 453, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145652\"><a href=\"/opinion/145652/anza-v-ideal-steel-supply-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1991</span></a></span>. Cleveland still has an obligation to file a complaint that is \"plausible on its face.\" <i>Bell,</i> 550 U.S. at 556, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145730\"><a href=\"/opinion/145730/bell-atlantic-corp-v-twombly/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1955</span></a></span>. Accordingly, we, just as the Supreme Court <span class=\"star-pagination\">*504</span> in <i>Anza,</i> proceed to the question of whether the complaint sufficiently pleaded proximate cause and, specifically, whether the allegations in the complaint satisfy the directness requirement.</p>\n<p>For the purposes of answering this question, the Supreme Court's application of <i>Holmes</i> in its subsequent decision <i>Anza</i> is instructive and consistent with how we believe the Ohio Supreme Court would consider this matter because the Ohio Supreme Court has previously adopted the directness requirement precedent of the United States Supreme Court. <i>See </i><i>Savedoff,</i> 524 F.3d at 762 (when a state's highest court has not addressed an issue, we anticipate how that court would rule). In <i>Anza,</i> the United States Supreme Court considered the private RICO claim of the plaintiff, Ideal, which alleged that the defendant, National, engaged in mail and wire fraud that led to lost sales at the plaintiff's business. <i>Anza,</i> 547 U.S. at 453, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145652\"><a href=\"/opinion/145652/anza-v-ideal-steel-supply-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1991</span></a></span>. Specifically, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant defrauded the New York tax authority and used the proceeds from this fraud to offer lower prices to its customers, which led to the plaintiff's lower sales because Ideal and National were competitors. <i>Id.</i> at 457-58, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145652\"><a href=\"/opinion/145652/anza-v-ideal-steel-supply-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1991</span></a></span>. The Court held that the complaint did not satisfy the directness requirement because the alleged violation did not lead directly to the plaintiff's injuries. <i>Id.</i> at 461, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145652\"><a href=\"/opinion/145652/anza-v-ideal-steel-supply-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1991</span></a></span>. It reasoned: \"The cause of Ideal's asserted harms ... is a set of actions (offering lower prices) entirely distinct from the alleged RICO violation (defrauding the State).\" <i>Id.</i> at 458, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145652\"><a href=\"/opinion/145652/anza-v-ideal-steel-supply-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1991</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>Similarly, here, the cause of the alleged harms is a set of actions (neglect of property, starting fires, looting, and dealing drugs) that is completely distinct from the asserted misconduct (financing subprime loans). <i>See id.; see also </i><i>Canyon County v. Syngenta Seeds, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1193916\"><a href=\"/opinion/1193916/canyon-county-v-syngenta-seeds-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">519</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">969</span></a></span>, 982 (9th Cir.2008) (\"Here, just as in <i>Anza,</i> the cause of the plaintiff's asserted harms is a set of actions (increased demand by people within Canyon County for public health care and law enforcement services) entirely distinct from the alleged RICO violation (the defendants' knowing hiring of undocumented workers).\"). This lack of directness exposes \"the difficulty that can arise when a court attempts to ascertain the damages caused by some remote action.\" <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>Holmes,</i> 503 U.S. at 269, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112708\"><a href=\"/opinion/112708/holmes-v-securities-investor-protection-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1311</span></a></span> (\"[T]he less direct an injury is, the more difficult it becomes to ascertain the amount of a plaintiff's damages attributable to the violation, as distinct from other, independent, factors.\")).</p>\n<p>Just as in <i>Anza,</i> \"[t]his conclusion is confirmed by considering the directness requirement's underlying premises.\" <i>Id.</i> Of the three <i>Holmes</i> factors, the first and third factors are squarely implicated by the facts alleged in the complaint. We begin with an analysis of the first factor, which states that indirectness adds to the difficulty of determining which damages can be attributed to the defendant's misconduct. <i>See </i><i>Beretta,</i> 768 N.E.2d at 1148 (summarizing the first <i>Holmes</i> factor). Again, <i>Anza</i> provides a useful comparison. In <i>Anza,</i> the Court noted that \"[t]he injury Ideal alleges is its own loss of sales resulting from National's decreased prices for cash-paying customers. National, however, could have lowered its prices <i>for any number of reasons unconnected to the asserted pattern of fraud.</i>\" <i>Anza,</i> 547 U.S. at 458-59, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145652\"><a href=\"/opinion/145652/anza-v-ideal-steel-supply-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1991</span></a></span> (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>Likewise, in this case, the injuries that Cleveland alleges could have been caused by many other factors unconnected to the Defendants' conduct. Companies that sold mortgages to home buyers decided which loans should be made and on what conditions. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*505</span> Although the complaint alleges that the Defendants sometimes dictated which types of loans to make, these companies ultimately made the decisions regarding where they would seek financing, which types of loans they would market and sell, and, once the mortgagee, whether to keep the mortgage or sell it to another buyer, such as one of the Defendants. Moreover, home buyers chose to enter into a subprime mortgage and to default on their loans. And, once the mortgagor defaulted, the mortgagee or his assigns chose to begin the foreclosure process. These voluntary choices were made for a variety of reasons unrelated to the Defendants.</p>\n<p>The alleged damages that subsequently occurredeyesores, fires, drug deals, and lootingwere also not directly caused by the Defendants. Homeowners, whether the initial buyers or mortgagees that later took possession of a home, were responsible for maintaining their properties. Fires were likely started by negligent or malicious individuals or occurred because a home was poorly built. Drug dealers and looters made independent decisions to engage in that criminal conduct. Additionally, other companies not listed in the complaint financed subprime loans and properties not subject to a subprime loan nevertheless entered into foreclosure. Similar to <i>Holmes</i> and <i>Anza,</i> Cleveland has not stated a viable claim when these actions could have occurred for \"any number of reasons unconnected to the asserted pattern of [misconduct].\" <i>Id.</i> at 458, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145652\"><a href=\"/opinion/145652/anza-v-ideal-steel-supply-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1991</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>The involvement of so many independent actors also reveals why Cleveland's reliance on <i>Beretta</i> is misplaced. In that case, the Ohio Supreme Court allowed a lawsuit against handgun manufacturers, brought under numerous theories of liability including public nuisance, to proceed past the motion to dismiss stage. <i>Beretta,</i> 768 N.E.2d at 1140. But, in <i>Beretta,</i> the plaintiffs accused the defendants of creating and supplying an illegal firearms market in Cincinnati through their marketing, distribution, and selling of firearms. <i>Id.</i> at 1143. By contrast, the complaint concedes that, for the most part, the Defendants did not directly make subprime loans to the homeowners of Cleveland. The Defendants are instead accused of financing a legal market for these loans. Thus, for <i>Beretta</i> to be analogous to the instant case, the Ohio Supreme Court would have had to allow a suit against the banks that provided financing to the gun manufacturers that allegedly created the illegal secondary market. Because there is another set of independent actors between the alleged misconduct and the alleged injury, the proximate cause holding in that case does not logically extend to this one.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>Another similar reason that the complaint does not satisfy the directness requirement, which also touches on the concerns implicated by the first <i>Holmes</i> factor, is that the remote connection between the alleged misconduct and the alleged injury makes it impossible \"to ascertain the amount of [Cleveland's] damages attributable to the violation.\" <i>See </i><i>Holmes,</i> 503 U.S. at 269, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112708\"><a href=\"/opinion/112708/holmes-v-securities-investor-protection-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1311</span></a></span>. The Court's reasoning in <i>Anza</i> is once more instructive:</p>\n<blockquote>There is, in addition, a second discontinuity between the RICO violation and the asserted injury. Ideal's lost sales could have resulted from factors other than petitioners' alleged acts of fraud. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*506</span> Businesses lose and gain customers for many reasons, and it would require a complex assessment to establish what portion of Ideal's lost sales were the product of National's decreased prices.... The attenuated connection between Ideal's injury and the Anzas' injurious conduct thus implicates fundamental concerns expressed in <i>Holmes.</i>\n</blockquote>\n<p><i>Anza,</i> 547 U.S. at 459, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145652\"><a href=\"/opinion/145652/anza-v-ideal-steel-supply-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1991</span></a></span> (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p>Just as in <i>Anza,</i> this case \"implicates fundamental concerns expressed in <i>Holmes.</i>\" <i>Id.</i> A \"complex assessment\" would be needed to determine which municipal expenditures increased and tax revenues decreased because of the ills caused by foreclosed homes rather than, <i>inter alia,</i> job losses due to the decline in manufacturing, fickle consumer tastes, deteriorating schools, a national recession, or increases in crime not related to foreclosures. <i>Id.</i> Cleveland points to many of these factors in its brief to demonstrate why the Defendants should have known to avoid financing subprime loans in Cleveland, but these same reasons make it impossible for Cleveland to plead proximate cause under Ohio law. <i>See id.</i> (\"Further illustrating this point is the speculative nature of the proceedings that would follow if Ideal were permitted to maintain its claim.\"); <i>see also </i><i>Canyon County,</i> 519 F.3d at 983 (\"The causal chain would also be difficult to ascertain because there are numerous alternative causes that might be the actual source or sources of the County's alleged harm.\").</p>\n<p>Finally, Cleveland's claim fails because, in accordance with <i>Holmes's</i> third factor, more immediate victims can sue to the extent that the Defendants violated any laws. <i>See </i><i>Anza,</i> 547 U.S. at 460, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145652\"><a href=\"/opinion/145652/anza-v-ideal-steel-supply-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1991</span></a></span> (\"The requirement of a direct causal connection is especially warranted where the immediate victims ... can be expected to vindicate the laws by pursuing their own claims.\"). The Supreme Court explained in <i>Anza</i> that when the adjudication of another party's claim would be \"relatively straightforward\" and \"considerably easier,\" \"[t]here is no need to broaden the universe of actionable harms to permit ... suits by parties who have been injured only indirectly.\" <i>Id.</i> Here, a suit brought by a mortgagor whose home has been foreclosed on would be \"relatively straightforward\" and damages would be \"considerably easier\" to calculate because the mortgagor could limit his suit to the specific Defendants that financed his subprime loan or loans. Additionally, other home owners who were injured because their neighborhood declined due to foreclosed homes, while not necessarily immediate victims, are closer in the alleged chain of causation than Cleveland. It would be easier to calculate the damages suffered by property owners in a specific neighborhood, where the court could more readily ascertain how many foreclosures occurred and what caused them, than to calculate the damages to the whole city of Cleveland. And, to the extent that misconduct occurred when the Defendants sold mortgages to create mortgage-backed securities, the buyers of these securities can bring their own causes of action. These other potential claims obviate the need for this court to allow Cleveland's claim to proceed.</p>\n<p>In sum, even when viewing the assertions in the complaint in a light most favorable to Cleveland, the connection between the alleged harm and the alleged misconduct is too indirect to warrant recovery. Although the facts are different than those before the Supreme Court in <i>Holmes</i> and <i>Anza,</i> the same directness concerns are implicated.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*507</span> III. Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Our proximate cause holding clearly resolves this case, and we therefore do not need to address the district court's remaining reasons for dismissing the complaint. Accordingly, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  In Ohio, a public nuisance is defined as \"an unreasonable interference with a right common to the general public.\" <i>Cincinnati v.

GMAC-RFC was not a party to the Joint Motion, and was neither an Amended Defendant nor an Eliminated Defendant.</p>\n<p>[5]  Cleveland could have contested the effect of the Joint Motion on its claim against GMACRFC. However, Cleveland has not made this argument in its briefs or at oral argument, so it is waived. <i>See </i><i>Farm Labor Org. Comm. v.
