BATCHELDER, Chief Judge. Carter Eubanks appeals his sentence,\nclaiming that the court erred in finding that his juvenile conviction in Michigan may be\nconsidered in designating him as an armed career criminal pursuant to the Armed Career\nCriminal Act (“ACCA”), 18 U.S.C. § 924(e). Because we find that the district court\ncorrectly determined that Eubanks’s prior conviction must be considered under the\nACCA, we AFFIRM.\n\n                                            I.\n\n       Carter Eubanks was apprehended by police officers after they responded to a\ncomplaint of a man selling drugs from his car in the parking lot of an apartment\ncomplex. Upon searching his car, the officers found two ounces of marijuana. The next\nday, they obtained a warrant to search his home and discovered a pistol. Eubanks was\nindicted for being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C.\n§ 922(g)(1); he pled guilty to the indictment without a plea agreement.\n\n       The pre-sentence investigation report (“PSR”) designated Eubanks an armed\ncareer criminal pursuant to the ACCA because of two prior controlled-substance\nviolations as an adult and a juvenile conviction for felonious assault, a designation that\nrequires a mandatory minimum sentence of fifteen years’ imprisonment. At the\nsentencing hearing, Eubanks objected to the use of the juvenile conviction to enhance\nhis sentence under the ACCA. He argued that the conviction should not be considered\nbecause Michigan law required that the record of his juvenile conviction be destroyed\nwhen he turned thirty years old, and he was thirty-one at the time of the instant offense.\nThe district court overruled the objection, noting that although Michigan law does\nprovide for the destruction of some juvenile records when an offender turns thirty years\nold, the law nonetheless permits the conviction itself to be used to calculate a future\nsentence.\n\fNo. 09-1254        United States v. Eubanks                                        Page 3\n\n\n       Because Eubanks meets the statutory requirements for designation as an armed\ncareer criminal, and because the mandatory minimum sentence under the ACCA is 180\nmonths, the district court sentenced him to 180 months’ imprisonment, though it stated\non the record its belief that this period of imprisonment was much too harsh.\n\n       Eubanks filed a timely notice of appeal.\n\n                                           II.\n\n       Eubanks argues that the district court committed procedural error in sentencing\nhim pursuant to the ACCA sentencing enhancement, 18 U.S.C. § 924(e), when he did\nnot in fact have the requisite three qualifying convictions. He argues that his juvenile\nconviction is not a qualifying conviction, because Michigan Court Rules require that the\nfiles and records of juvenile offenses be destroyed when the offender turns thirty years\nold, and that this is an effective expunction under federal law.          See 18 U.S.C.\n§ 921(a)(20) (“a conviction which has been expunged . . . shall not be considered a\nconviction for purposes of this chapter.”). In the alternative, he argues that even if his\njuvenile conviction was not expunged, Michigan law should have prevented the\ndisclosure of the records of that conviction, and without those records, the court could\nnot have conducted the review necessary to determine whether the offense qualified as\na violent felony under the ACCA. See Shepard v. United States, 544 U.S. 13 (2005).\n\n       A. Expunction of the Juvenile Record\n\n       We review de novo the district court’s interpretation of a federal statute,\nincluding whether a conviction constitutes a violent felony for purposes of that statute.\nUnited States v. Hargrove, 416 F.3d 486, 494 (6th Cir. 2005).\n\n       The ACCA provides that one convicted of being a felon in possession of a\nfirearm who has three prior convictions for either violent felonies or serious drug\noffenses is subject to a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years’ imprisonment.\n18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(1). Eubanks concedes that his two prior adult convictions qualify as\nserious drug offenses, as defined by § 924(e)(2); however, he argues that his juvenile\n\fNo. 09-1254         United States v. Eubanks                                         Page 4\n\n\nconviction for felonious assault does not qualify as a violent felony because it falls under\nthe expunction exception of 18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(20).\n\n        A violent felony under the ACCA is defined as:\n\n                (B) . . . any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term\n                exceeding one year, or any act of juvenile delinquency\n                involving the use or carrying of a firearm, knife, or\n                destructive device that would be punishable by\n                imprisonment for such term if committed by an adult that\n                --\n                          (i) has as an element the use, attempted\n                          use, or threatened use of physical force\n                          against the person of another; or\n                          (ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion,\n                          involves use of explosives, or otherwise\n                          involves conduct that presents a serious\n                          potential risk of physical injury to another\n                          ....\n\n18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(B). An exception to this general rule is that “what constitutes a\nconviction . . . shall be determined in accordance with the law of the jurisdiction in\nwhich the proceedings were held” and “[a]ny conviction which has been expunged or\nset aside . . . shall not be considered a conviction” sufficient to qualify as one of the\npredicate three convictions under the ACCA enhancement. 18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(20).\n\n        Eubanks argues that his juvenile conviction, even if it would otherwise qualify\nas a “violent felony,” has been effectively expunged by a Michigan Court Rule which\nprovides that “the court must destroy the files and records pertaining to a person’s\njuvenile offenses when the person becomes 30 years old.” Mich. Ct. R. 3.925(E)(2)(c).\nThe rule also specifically provides that “[d]estruction of a file does not negate, rescind,\nor set aside an adjudication.” Mich. Ct. R. 3.925(E)(1). And another section of the rule\nprovides the specific route by which a juvenile offender may attempt to have his juvenile\nadjudication or conviction set aside. See Mich. Ct. R. 3.925(F) (“[t]he setting aside of\njuvenile adjudications is governed by M.C.L. 712A.18e” and “[t]he court may only set\n\fNo. 09-1254            United States v. Eubanks                                                     Page 5\n\n\naside a conviction as provided by M.C.L. 780.621 et. seq.”).1 Critically, several\nsubsections of Rule 3.925 provide that “the register of actions” must not be destroyed.\nSee Mich. Ct. R. 3.925 (E)(1), (2)(b) and (2)(d). This “register of actions” is established\nby Michigan Court Rule 8.119(D)(1)(c), which requires that among the records that must\nbe kept by the clerk of each trial court is the register of actions, which must include,\namong other things: the offense; the judge assigned to the case; the date of trials and\nhearings; the orders, judgments, and verdicts; and the date and manner of adjudication\nand disposition. Mich. Ct. R. 8.119(D)(1)(c).\n\n         An analysis of the plain language of the federal and Michigan statutes indicates\nthat the destruction of records required by the rule is not the expunction contemplated\nby 18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(20). Michigan case law makes it clear that juvenile convictions,\nsome records of which have been destroyed pursuant to Michigan Court Rules, may\nnonetheless be considered by a sentencing judge when sentencing an adult offender. See\nPeople v. Smith, 470 N.W.2d 70, 75 (Mich. 1991). In Smith, a criminal defendant\nchallenged the inclusion of his juvenile record in his PSR, arguing that because the\njuvenile record should have been automatically expunged under the Michigan Court\nRule,2 it should not be considered by the trial judge in determining whether he qualified\nas an habitual offender under state law. The Michigan Supreme Court disagreed,\nexplaining that “[t]he purpose of the court rule . . . is to prevent a juvenile record from\nbecoming an obstacle to educational, social, or employment opportunities. When,\nhowever, a juvenile offender appears in court again as an adult, his juvenile offense\nrecord may be considered in imposing the sentence.” Id.\n\n         Despite this settled Michigan law, Eubanks proffers two unpublished Sixth\nCircuit cases that appear at first glance to be quite helpful to his argument, namely\n\n         1\n         It appears that Mr. Eubanks would be ineligible to set aside his juvenile offense, because the\nMichigan statute providing for set asides requires that the applicant have no felony convictions and not\nmore than one juvenile offense. See M.C.L. 712A.18e(1).\n         2\n          The Michigan Court Rule then in operation was former Rule 5.913, which required certain\njuvenile court records to be “expunged” when the offender turned 27. It should be noted that this language\nis stronger than the current rule, which uses the term “destroyed” rather than “expunged,” further\nstrengthening the conclusion that mere destruction of records is insufficient to exclude juvenile convictions\nfrom future sentencing consideration.\n\fNo. 09-1254        United States v. Eubanks                                         Page 6\n\n\nUnited States v. Flores, 118 F. App’x 49 (6th Cir. 2004) (unpublished), and United\nStates v. Merryman, 16 F.3d 1222, 1994 WL 54430 (6th Cir. Feb. 23,1994) (unpublished\ntable decision). Both cases involved the question of whether certain Michigan juvenile\noffenses could be counted as predicate offenses under the ACCA if they were supposed\nto have been expunged as a matter of law. They are, however, inapposite. In both cases,\nthe parties and the court assumed that Michigan’s Court Rules expunge the juvenile\noffense for purposes of the ACCA. In neither case is that issue — which is the heart of\nthe instant case — discussed or decided by the court. And in neither case is Michigan’s\ndecisional law, particularly the Michigan Supreme Court’s decision in Smith, mentioned.\nInstead, Flores focused on whether the defendant’s being barred from obtaining a\nconcealed weapons permit (a bar which resulted from his juvenile offense) could\nresurrect his presumably expunged juvenile conviction for consideration under the\nACCA. Flores, 118 F. App’x at 52-53. And Merryman’s holding focused solely on the\ntiming of expunction, stating that only convictions that exist at the time of a defendant’s\nsentencing may be considered as ACCA predicate offenses. Merryman, 1994 WL\n54430, at *4.\n\n       Eubanks also attempts to dismiss the holding of Smith by pointing to the policy\nconsiderations behind the Michigan Supreme Court’s allowing the use of prior juvenile\nconvictions. See Smith, 470 N.W.2d at 75 (explaining that judges need access to\ncomplete information in order to properly individualize each offender’s sentence and that\none’s juvenile offender history may reveal an even more extensive pattern of\nlawbreaking than does the adult record alone). He argues that this policy rationale is not\napplicable in the federal ACCA setting because the use of juvenile convictions for\nACCA purposes actually hinders a judge from tailoring an individualized sentence, in\nthat it triggers the statutory minimum and deprives the judge of discretion. But Eubanks\nhas not explained why this argument is relevant to our inquiry of what the status of his\njuvenile conviction would be according to the laws of the state of Michigan. It is not the\npolicy considerations underlying the Smith decision that concern us here; our task is to\napply Michigan law as we find it. See also United States v. Ellis, 604 F. Supp. 2d 346,\n\fNo. 09-1254        United States v. Eubanks                                        Page 7\n\n\n348-49 (D. Mass. 2009) (explaining that when state law allows for the use of a juvenile\nconviction in imposing sentence, then it may also be used under the federal ACCA).\n\n       The ACCA requires the federal court to look to the law of the state — here, the\nlaw of Michigan — to determine the status of a defendant’s prior convictions; the\nMichigan Court Rules provide for the destruction of certain juvenile records when the\noffender turns thirty, but they do not expunge or set aside any juvenile conviction, or\nprevent the use of that conviction by the sentencing judge in later state court\nproceedings. The district court therefore did not err in concluding that Eubanks’s 1992\njuvenile conviction for felonious assault is an ACCA predicate offense.\n\n               B. Review of the Juvenile Offense under Shepard\n\n       Eubanks’s alternative argument is that even if the district court must consider his\njuvenile offense in determining whether he is an armed career criminal, the court’s\nprocedures in making that determination were erroneous. Because under Michigan law\nmost of the records should have been destroyed, Eubanks argues, the court should not\nhave been able to access them in order to determine whether the offense qualified as a\nviolent felony under the ACCA.\n\n       Ordinarily, we review sentences under an abuse-of-discretion standard, looking\nfirst to determine whether the district court committed any significant procedural error.\nSee Gall v. United States, 552 U.S. 38, 51 (2007). But Eubanks did not object at\nsentencing to the court’s use of the facts contained in the charging document for the\njuvenile felonious assault conviction — indeed, Eubanks expressly conceded in his\nObjections to the PSR and during the course of the sentencing hearing that the charging\ndocuments reflected that this juvenile conviction was for an offense that involved the use\nof a firearm. And Eubanks raised no objection at the conclusion of sentencing when the\ncourt inquired whether there remained any legal objections to the sentence. Our review\nis therefore for plain error. United States v. Vonner, 516 F.3d 382, 386 (6th Cir. 2008).\nAnd we will reverse for plain error only where the error not only affects substantial\nrights, but “seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial\nproceedings.” United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 732 (1993).\n\fNo. 09-1254         United States v. Eubanks                                         Page 8\n\n\n        To qualify as a predicate “violent felony” under the ACCA, a juvenile offense\nmust not only meet the qualifications for an adult predicate offense (be punishable by\nmore than a year in prison and involve the use, attempted use, or threatened use of\nphysical force against another), but it must also involve “the use or carrying of a firearm,\nknife, or destructive device.” 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(B). The Michigan statute under\nwhich Eubanks was convicted, M.C.L. 750.82, defines “felonious assault” to include\nassault with a firearm. However, the statutory definition includes as well assaults with\nsuch things as iron bars, clubs, and brass knuckles, none of which is included in the\nACCA’s definition of “violent felony.”\n\n        Clearly, Eubanks’s juvenile conviction is for violation of a statute which\nproscribes both conduct that would constitute a violent felony under the ACCA and\nconduct that would not. Under those circumstances, in determining whether that prior\nconviction constitutes a violent felony, the sentencing court is limited to considering “the\nterms of the charging document, the terms of a plea agreement or transcript of colloquy\nbetween judge and defendant in which the factual basis for the plea was confirmed by\nthe defendant, or to some comparable judicial record of this information.” Shepard, 544\nU.S. at 26.\n\n        Eubanks asserts that the documentation required to demonstrate that he used a\nfirearm, knife, or destructive device during the commission of his juvenile felonious\nassault should have been unavailable to the district court because his juvenile record was\nsupposed to have been destroyed. He argues that the fact of his conviction and the\nexamination of the Michigan statute by themselves would not be sufficient to\ndemonstrate his use of such a weapon or device.\n\n        But Eubanks’s argument misses the mark. Eubanks himself acknowledged to the\ndistrict court, both in his filed objections to the PSR and in the colloquy at sentencing,\nthat the charging documents revealed that the juvenile felonious assault conviction\ninvolved his use of a gun. And Eubanks raised no objection at sentencing to the district\ncourt’s reliance on that fact.\n\fNo. 09-1254         United States v. Eubanks                                          Page 9\n\n\n         Beyond that, Michigan Court Rules do not require that all of a juvenile offender’s\nrecords be destroyed. In fact, the rules require that the “register of actions” must not be\ndestroyed, Mich. Ct. R. 3.925 (E)(1), (2)(b) and (2)(d), and that register must include,\namong other things, the offense, the judge assigned to the case, the date of trials and\nhearings, the orders, judgments, and verdicts, and the date and manner of adjudication\nand disposition. Mich. Ct. R. 8.119(D)(1)(c). It is far from clear that the district court\nbased its decision on any document required by the Michigan Court Rules to have been\ndestroyed. The PSR, in its detailing of the juvenile offense as part of Eubanks’s criminal\nhistory, refers to the “petition,” which reflects that the offense involved the use of a gun.\nEubanks has provided us no basis upon which to infer that this petition was not a record\nthat is required to be part of the register of actions established by Rule 8.119(D)(1)(c).\nAnd, as we have already discussed, the Michigan Supreme Court has made it clear that\nwhen “a juvenile offender appears in court again as an adult, his juvenile offense record\nmay be considered in imposing the sentence.” Smith, 470 N.W.2d at 75.\n\n         Under these circumstances, we conclude that if the district court committed any\nerror at all by considering Eubanks’s juvenile felonious assault conviction and in\nconcluding that it constituted a violent felony under the ACCA, that error certainly was\nnot plain.\n\n                                            III.\n\n         For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the sentence imposed by the district\ncourt.\n\f",

Eubanks was indicted for being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1); he pled guilty to the indictment without a plea agreement.</p>\n<p>The pre-sentence investigation report (\"PSR\") designated Eubanks an armed career criminal pursuant to the ACCA because of two prior controlled-substance violations as an adult and a juvenile conviction for felonious assault, a designation <span class=\"star-pagination\">*366</span> that requires a mandatory minimum sentence of fifteen years' imprisonment. At the sentencing hearing, Eubanks objected to the use of the juvenile conviction to enhance his sentence under the ACCA. He argued that the conviction should not be considered because Michigan law required that the record of his juvenile conviction be destroyed when he turned thirty years old, and he was thirty-one at the time of the instant offense. The district court overruled the objection, noting that although Michigan law does provide for the destruction of some juvenile records when an offender turns thirty years old, the law nonetheless permits the conviction itself to be used to calculate a future sentence.</p>\n<p>Because Eubanks meets the statutory requirements for designation as an armed career criminal, and because the mandatory minimum sentence under the ACCA is 180 months, the district court sentenced him to 180 months' imprisonment, though it stated on the record its belief that this period of imprisonment was much too harsh.</p>\n<p>Eubanks filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>Eubanks argues that the district court committed procedural error in sentencing him pursuant to the ACCA sentencing enhancement, 18 U.S.C. § 924(e), when he did not in fact have the requisite three qualifying convictions. He argues that his juvenile conviction is not a qualifying conviction, because Michigan Court Rules require that the files and records of juvenile offenses be destroyed when the offender turns thirty years old, and that this is an effective expunction under federal law. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(20) (\"a conviction which has been expunged ... shall not be considered a conviction for purposes of this chapter.\"). In the alternative, he argues that even if his juvenile conviction was not expunged, Michigan law should have prevented the disclosure of the records of that conviction, and without those records, the court could not have conducted the review necessary to determine whether the offense qualified as a violent felony under the ACCA. <i>See </i><i>Shepard v. United States,</i> 544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Expunction of the Juvenile Record</h2>\n<p>We review de novo the district court's interpretation of a federal statute, including whether a conviction constitutes a violent felony for purposes of that statute. <i>United States v. Hargrove,</i> 416 F.3d 486, 494 (6th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p>The ACCA provides that one convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm who has three prior convictions for either violent felonies or serious drug offenses is subject to a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years' imprisonment. 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(1). Eubanks concedes that his two prior adult convictions qualify as serious drug offenses, as defined by § 924(e)(2); however, he argues that his juvenile conviction for felonious assault does not qualify as a violent felony because it falls under the expunction exception of 18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(20).</p>\n<p>A violent felony under the ACCA is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote>(B) ... any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, or any act of juvenile delinquency involving the use or carrying of a firearm, knife, or destructive device that would be punishable by imprisonment for such term if committed by an adult that </blockquote>\n<blockquote>(i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*367</span> physical force against the person of another; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another. ...</blockquote>\n<p>18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(B). An exception to this general rule is that \"what constitutes a conviction ... shall be determined in accordance with the law of the jurisdiction in which the proceedings were held\" and \"[a]ny conviction which has been expunged or set aside ... shall not be considered a conviction\" sufficient to qualify as one of the predicate three convictions under the ACCA enhancement. 18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(20).</p>\n<p>Eubanks argues that his juvenile conviction, even if it would otherwise qualify as a \"violent felony,\" has been effectively expunged by a Michigan Court Rule which provides that \"the court must destroy the files and records pertaining to a person's juvenile offenses when the person becomes 30 years old.\" Mich. Ct. R. 3.925(E)(2)(c). The rule also specifically provides that \"[d]estruction of a file does not negate, rescind, or set aside an adjudication.\" Mich. Ct. R. 3.925(E)(1). And another section of the rule provides the specific route by which a juvenile offender may attempt to have his juvenile adjudication or conviction set aside. <i>See</i> Mich. Ct. R. 3.925(F) (\"[t]he setting aside of juvenile adjudications is governed by M.C.L. 712A.18e\" and \"[t]he court may only set aside a conviction as provided by M.C.L. 780.621 <i>et seq.</i>\").<sup>[1]</sup> Critically, several subsections of Rule 3.925 provide that \"the register of actions\" must not be destroyed. <i>See</i> Mich. Ct. R. 3.925(E)(1), (2)(b) and (2)(d). This \"register of actions\" is established by Michigan Court Rule 8.119(D)(1)(c), which requires that among the records that must be kept by the clerk of each trial court is the register of actions, which must include, among other things: the offense; the judge assigned to the case; the date of trials and hearings; the orders, judgments, and verdicts; and the date and manner of adjudication and disposition. Mich. Ct. R. 8.119(D)(1)(c).</p>\n<p>An analysis of the plain language of the federal and Michigan statutes indicates that the destruction of records required by the rule is not the expunction contemplated by 18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(20). Michigan case law makes it clear that juvenile convictions, some records of which have been destroyed pursuant to Michigan Court Rules, may nonetheless be considered by a sentencing judge when sentencing an adult offender. <i>See </i><i>People v. Smith,</i> 437 Mich. 293, 470 N.W.2d 70, 75 (1991). In <i>Smith,</i> a criminal defendant challenged the inclusion of his juvenile record in his PSR, arguing that because the juvenile record should have been automatically expunged under the Michigan Court Rule,<sup>[2]</sup> it should not be considered by the trial judge in determining whether he qualified as an habitual offender under state law. The Michigan Supreme Court disagreed, explaining that \"[t]he purpose of the court rule ... is to prevent a juvenile record from becoming <span class=\"star-pagination\">*368</span> an obstacle to educational, social, or employment opportunities. When, however, a juvenile offender appears in court again as an adult, his juvenile offense record may be considered in imposing the sentence.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Despite this settled Michigan law, Eubanks proffers two unpublished Sixth Circuit cases that appear at first glance to be quite helpful to his argument, namely <i>United States v. Flores,</i> 118 Fed.Appx. 49 (6th Cir.2004) (unpublished), and <i>United States v. Merryman,</i> 16 F.3d 1222, 1994 WL 54430 (6th Cir. Feb.23,1994) (unpublished table decision). Both cases involved the question of whether certain Michigan juvenile offenses could be counted as predicate offenses under the ACCA if they were supposed to have been expunged as a matter of law. They are, however, inapposite. In both cases, the parties and the court assumed that Michigan's Court Rules expunge the juvenile offense for purposes of the ACCA. In neither case is that issue  which is the heart of the instant case  discussed or decided by the court. And in neither case is Michigan's decisional law, particularly the Michigan Supreme Court's decision in <i>Smith,</i> mentioned. Instead, <i>Flores</i> focused on whether the defendant's being barred from obtaining a concealed weapons permit (a bar which resulted from his juvenile offense) could resurrect his presumably expunged juvenile conviction for consideration under the ACCA. <i>Flores,</i> 118 Fed.Appx. at 52-53. And <i>Merryman's</i> holding focused solely on the timing of expunction, stating that only convictions that exist at the time of a defendant's sentencing may be considered as ACCA predicate offenses. <i>Merryman,</i> 1994 WL 54430, at *4.</p>\n<p>Eubanks also attempts to dismiss the holding of <i>Smith</i> by pointing to the policy considerations behind the Michigan Supreme Court's allowing the use of prior juvenile convictions. <i>See </i><i>Smith,</i> 470 N.W.2d at 75 (explaining that judges need access to complete information in order to properly individualize each offender's sentence and that one's juvenile offender history may reveal an even more extensive pattern of lawbreaking than does the adult record alone). He argues that this policy rationale is not applicable in the federal ACCA setting because the use of juvenile convictions for ACCA purposes actually hinders a judge from tailoring an individualized sentence, in that it triggers the statutory minimum and deprives the judge of discretion. But Eubanks has not explained why this argument is relevant to our inquiry of what the status of his juvenile conviction would be according to the laws of the state of Michigan. It is not the policy considerations underlying the <i>Smith</i> decision that concern us here; our task is to apply Michigan law as we find it. <i>See also </i><i>United States v. Ellis,</i> 604 F.Supp.2d 346, 348-49 (D.Mass.2009) (explaining that when state law allows for the use of a juvenile conviction in imposing sentence, then it may also be used under the federal ACCA).</p>\n<p>The ACCA requires the federal court to look to the law of the state  here, the law of Michigan  to determine the status of a defendant's prior convictions; the Michigan Court Rules provide for the destruction of certain juvenile records when the offender turns thirty, but they do not expunge or set aside any juvenile conviction, or prevent the use of that conviction by the sentencing judge in later state court proceedings. The district court therefore did not err in concluding that Eubanks's 1992 juvenile conviction for felonious assault is an ACCA predicate offense.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Review of the Juvenile Offense under <i>Shepard</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Eubanks's alternative argument is that even if the district court must consider his <span class=\"star-pagination\">*369</span> juvenile offense in determining whether he is an armed career criminal, the court's procedures in making that determination were erroneous. Because under Michigan law most of the records should have been destroyed, Eubanks argues, the court should not have been able to access them in order to determine whether the offense qualified as a violent felony under the ACCA.</p>\n<p>Ordinarily, we review sentences under an abuse-of-discretion standard, looking first to determine whether the district court committed any significant procedural error. <i>See </i><i>Gall v. United States,</i> 552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). But Eubanks did not object at sentencing to the court's use of the facts contained in the charging document for the juvenile felonious assault conviction  indeed, Eubanks expressly conceded in his Objections to the PSR and during the course of the sentencing hearing that the charging documents reflected that this juvenile conviction was for an offense that involved the use of a firearm. And Eubanks raised no objection at the conclusion of sentencing when the court inquired whether there remained any legal objections to the sentence. Our review is therefore for plain error. <i>United States v. Vonner,</i> 516 F.3d 382, 386 (6th Cir.2008). And we will reverse for plain error only where the error not only affects substantial rights, but \"seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>United States v. Olano,</i> 507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).</p>\n<p>To qualify as a predicate \"violent felony\" under the ACCA, a juvenile offense must not only meet the qualifications for an adult predicate offense (be punishable by more than a year in prison and involve the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against another), but it must also involve \"the use or carrying of a firearm, knife, or destructive device.\" 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(B). The Michigan statute under which Eubanks was convicted, M.C.L. 750.82, defines \"felonious assault\" to include assault with a firearm. However, the statutory definition includes as well assaults with such things as iron bars, clubs, and brass knuckles, none of which is included in the ACCA's definition of \"violent felony.\"</p>\n<p>Clearly, Eubanks's juvenile conviction is for violation of a statute which proscribes both conduct that would constitute a violent felony under the ACCA and conduct that would not. Under those circumstances, in determining whether that prior conviction constitutes a violent felony, the sentencing court is limited to considering \"the terms of the charging document, the terms of a plea agreement or transcript of colloquy between judge and defendant in which the factual basis for the plea was confirmed by the defendant, or to some comparable judicial record of this information.\" <i>Shepard,</i> 544 U.S. at 26, 125 S.Ct. 1254.</p>\n<p>Eubanks asserts that the documentation required to demonstrate that he used a firearm, knife, or destructive device during the commission of his juvenile felonious assault should have been unavailable to the district court because his juvenile record was supposed to have been destroyed. He argues that the fact of his conviction and the examination of the Michigan statute by themselves would not be sufficient to demonstrate his use of such a weapon or device.</p>\n<p>But Eubanks's argument misses the mark. Eubanks himself acknowledged to the district court, both in his filed objections to the PSR and in the colloquy at sentencing, that the charging documents revealed that the juvenile felonious assault conviction involved his use of a gun. And <span class=\"star-pagination\">*370</span> Eubanks raised no objection at sentencing to the district court's reliance on that fact.</p>\n<p>Beyond that, Michigan Court Rules do not require that all of a juvenile offender's records be destroyed. In fact, the rules require that the \"register of actions\" must <i>not</i> be destroyed, Mich. Ct. R. 3.925(E)(1), (2)(b) and (2)(d), and that register must include, among other things, the offense, the judge assigned to the case, the date of trials and hearings, the orders, judgments, and verdicts, and the date and manner of adjudication and disposition. Mich. Ct. R. 8.119(D)(1)(c). It is far from clear that the district court based its decision on any document required by the Michigan Court Rules to have been destroyed. The PSR, in its detailing of the juvenile offense as part of Eubanks's criminal history, refers to the \"petition,\" which reflects that the offense involved the use of a gun. Eubanks has provided us no basis upon which to infer that this petition was not a record that is required to be part of the register of actions established by Rule 8.119(D)(1)(c). And, as we have already discussed, the Michigan Supreme Court has made it clear that when \"a juvenile offender appears in court again as an adult, his juvenile offense record may be considered in imposing the sentence.\" <i>Smith,</i> 470 N.W.2d at 75.</p>\n<p>Under these circumstances, we conclude that if the district court committed any error at all by considering Eubanks's juvenile felonious assault conviction and in concluding that it constituted a violent felony under the ACCA, that error certainly was not plain.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the sentence imposed by the district court.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  This decision was originally issued as an \"unpublished decision\" filed August 3, 2010. The court has now designated the opinion as one recommended for full-text publication.</p>\n<p>[**]  The Honorable J. Ronnie Greer, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Tennessee, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  It appears that Mr. Eubanks would be ineligible to set aside his juvenile offense, because the Michigan statute providing for set asides requires that the applicant have no felony convictions and not more than one juvenile offense. <i>See</i> M.C.L. 712A.18e(1).</p>\n<p>[2]  The Michigan Court Rule then in operation was former Rule 5.913, which required certain juvenile court records to be \"expunged\" when the offender turned 27. It should be noted that this language is stronger than the current rule, which uses the term \"destroyed\" rather than \"expunged,\" further strengthening the conclusion that mere destruction of records is insufficient to exclude juvenile convictions from future sentencing consideration.</p>\n\n</div>",

Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">346</span></a></span>, 348-49 (D.Mass.2009) (explaining that when state law allows for the use of a juvenile conviction in imposing sentence, then it may also be used under the federal ACCA).</p>\n<p>The ACCA requires the federal court to look to the law of the state  here, the law of Michigan  to determine the status of a defendant's prior convictions; the Michigan Court Rules provide for the destruction of certain juvenile records when the offender turns thirty, but they do not expunge or set aside any juvenile conviction, or prevent the use of that conviction by the sentencing judge in later state court proceedings. The district court therefore did not err in concluding that Eubanks's 1992 juvenile conviction for felonious assault is an ACCA predicate offense.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Review of the Juvenile Offense under <i>Shepard</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Eubanks's alternative argument is that even if the district court must consider his <span class=\"star-pagination\">*369</span> juvenile offense in determining whether he is an armed career criminal, the court's procedures in making that determination were erroneous. Because under Michigan law most of the records should have been destroyed, Eubanks argues, the court should not have been able to access them in order to determine whether the offense qualified as a violent felony under the ACCA.</p>\n<p>Ordinarily, we review sentences under an abuse-of-discretion standard, looking first to determine whether the district court committed any significant procedural error. <i>See </i><i>Gall v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145843\"><a href=\"/opinion/145843/gall-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">552</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">38</span></a></span>, 51, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145843\"><a href=\"/opinion/145843/gall-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">586</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145843\"><a href=\"/opinion/145843/gall-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">169</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">445</span></a></span> (2007). But Eubanks did not object at sentencing to the court's use of the facts contained in the charging document for the juvenile felonious assault conviction  indeed, Eubanks expressly conceded in his Objections to the PSR and during the course of the sentencing hearing that the charging documents reflected that this juvenile conviction was for an offense that involved the use of a firearm. And Eubanks raised no objection at the conclusion of sentencing when the court inquired whether there remained any legal objections to the sentence. Our review is therefore for plain error. <i>United States v. Vonner,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1262428\"><a href=\"/opinion/1262428/united-states-v-vonner/\"><span class=\"volume\">516</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">382</span></a></span>, 386 (6th Cir.2008). And we will reverse for plain error only where the error not only affects substantial rights, but \"seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>United States v. Olano,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">725</span></a></span>, 732, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1770</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">508</span></a></span> (1993).</p>\n<p>To qualify as a predicate \"violent felony\" under the ACCA, a juvenile offense must not only meet the qualifications for an adult predicate offense (be punishable by more than a year in prison and involve the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against another), but it must also involve \"the use or carrying of a firearm, knife, or destructive device.\" 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(B). The Michigan statute under which Eubanks was convicted, M.C.L. 750.82, defines \"felonious assault\" to include assault with a firearm. However, the statutory definition includes as well assaults with such things as iron bars, clubs, and brass knuckles, none of which is included in the ACCA's definition of \"violent felony.\"</p>\n<p>Clearly, Eubanks's juvenile conviction is for violation of a statute which proscribes both conduct that would constitute a violent felony under the ACCA and conduct that would not. Under those circumstances, in determining whether that prior conviction constitutes a violent felony, the sentencing court is limited to considering \"the terms of the charging document, the terms of a plea agreement or transcript of colloquy between judge and defendant in which the factual basis for the plea was confirmed by the defendant, or to some comparable judicial record of this information.\" <i>Shepard,</i> 544 U.S. at 26, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"142875\"><a href=\"/opinion/142875/shepard-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1254</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>Eubanks asserts that the documentation required to demonstrate that he used a firearm, knife, or destructive device during the commission of his juvenile felonious assault should have been unavailable to the district court because his juvenile record was supposed to have been destroyed. He argues that the fact of his conviction and the examination of the Michigan statute by themselves would not be sufficient to demonstrate his use of such a weapon or device.</p>\n<p>But Eubanks's argument misses the mark. Eubanks himself acknowledged to the district court, both in his filed objections to the PSR and in the colloquy at sentencing, that the charging documents revealed that the juvenile felonious assault conviction involved his use of a gun. And <span class=\"star-pagination\">*370</span> Eubanks raised no objection at sentencing to the district court's reliance on that fact.</p>\n<p>Beyond that, Michigan Court Rules do not require that all of a juvenile offender's records be destroyed. In fact, the rules require that the \"register of actions\" must <i>not</i> be destroyed, Mich. Ct. R. 3.925(E)(1), (2)(b) and (2)(d), and that register must include, among other things, the offense, the judge assigned to the case, the date of trials and hearings, the orders, judgments, and verdicts, and the date and manner of adjudication and disposition. Mich. Ct. R. 8.119(D)(1)(c). It is far from clear that the district court based its decision on any document required by the Michigan Court Rules to have been destroyed. The PSR, in its detailing of the juvenile offense as part of Eubanks's criminal history, refers to the \"petition,\" which reflects that the offense involved the use of a gun. Eubanks has provided us no basis upon which to infer that this petition was not a record that is required to be part of the register of actions established by Rule 8.119(D)(1)(c). And, as we have already discussed, the Michigan Supreme Court has made it clear that when \"a juvenile offender appears in court again as an adult, his juvenile offense record may be considered in imposing the sentence.\" <i>Smith,</i> 470 N.W.2d at 75.</p>\n<p>Under these circumstances, we conclude that if the district court committed any error at all by considering Eubanks's juvenile felonious assault conviction and in concluding that it constituted a violent felony under the ACCA, that error certainly was not plain.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the sentence imposed by the district court.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  This decision was originally issued as an \"unpublished decision\" filed August 3, 2010. The court has now designated the opinion as one recommended for full-text publication.</p>\n<p>[**]  The Honorable J. Ronnie Greer, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Tennessee, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  It appears that Mr. Eubanks would be ineligible to set aside his juvenile offense, because the Michigan statute providing for set asides requires that the applicant have no felony convictions and not more than one juvenile offense. <i>See</i> M.C.L. 712A.18e(1).</p>\n<p>[2]  The Michigan Court Rule then in operation was former Rule 5.913, which required certain juvenile court records to be \"expunged\" when the offender turned 27. It should be noted that this language is stronger than the current rule, which uses the term \"destroyed\" rather than \"expunged,\" further strengthening the conclusion that mere destruction of records is insufficient to exclude juvenile convictions from future sentencing consideration.</p>\n\n</div>",
