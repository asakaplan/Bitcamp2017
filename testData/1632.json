Javitch, Block & Rathbone (JB&R) represented a\nclient who attempted to collect a credit card debt from Norma Lee. After obtaining a\n\n\n                                         1\n\fNo. 08-4485           Lee v. Javitch, Block & Rathbone LLP                            Page 2\n\n\ndefault judgment in state court against Lee, JB&R attorney Victor Javitch filed for a\nnon-wage garnishment of Lee’s bank account. To do so, Javitch signed and filed a\nrequired affidavit stating that he had a “reasonable basis to believe that [Lee’s Bank]\nmay have property, other than personal earnings, of [Lee] that is not exempt under the\nlaws of this state or the United States.” The state court initially garnished the money\nfrom Lee’s bank accounts, but the court later returned the money after Lee proved that\nthe account contained only Social Security disability payments, which are exempt funds.\nLee then sued JB&R, contending that Javitch did not have the reasonable basis claimed\nin the affidavit, and thus that his signing and filing of the affidavit violated the Fair Debt\nCollection Practices Act and the Ohio Consumer Sales Practices Act. Because Lee did\nnot establish at trial that reasonableness demanded any additional investigation of Lee’s\nbank accounts, she did not prove that Javitch’s affidavit was false. Lee is therefore not\nentitled to relief.\n\n        JB&R represented Midland Funding, LLC (Midland) in its attempts to collect a\n$2,795.75 credit card debt originally owed on an Aspire Visa. In February, 2006,\nMidland provided information to JB&R indicating that the debt was owed by Norma Lee\nand that Lee resided on Birchridge Drive in Cincinnati, Ohio. On February 16, JB&R\nsent a validation notice as required by 15 U.S.C. § 1692g(a) to the Birchridge Drive\naddress, but JB&R did not receive any response. Before February 16, Lee had moved\nfrom Birchridge Drive to Landis Lane, but JB&R did not have notice of her move. In\nFebruary and early March, JB&R Recovery Specialist Frank Stefanelli assessed whether\nthe debt was collectible. Following JB&R procedures, Stefanelli determined the\nfollowing: First, Lee was below retirement age, so it was less likely that she was\nreceiving Social Security retirement payments. Second, the zip code containing the\nBirchridge Drive address had a median income of $43,588, so it was more likely that Lee\nwould be capable of repaying the debt. Third, Lee was not listed as a property owner\nin the county containing the Birchridge Drive address. Fourth, Lee’s credit report listed\nno medical debts, which might have been an indication that Lee was receiving disability\npayments, and the report neither indicated that the Midland debt was disputed nor\ncontained any suggestions that Lee had been the victim of identity theft. Additionally,\n\fNo. 08-4485           Lee v. Javitch, Block & Rathbone LLP                                   Page 3\n\n\nJB&R called Lee multiple times during this period, but she neither answered the phone\nnor returned JB&R’s voice mails. Lee testified at trial that she had never received any\nof these calls. Stefanelli concluded that this information indicated that the debt was\ncollectible, and on March 8, he recommended to his superiors that JB&R file a\ncollections suit against Lee. JB&R filed suit against Lee on April 11, 2006, in Ohio\nmunicipal court and obtained a default judgment for $2,795.75. On July 12, JB&R filed\nfor a non-wage garnishment of Lee’s bank account in the same Ohio municipal court.\nAttached to the filing was an affidavit, signed by JB&R attorney Victor Javitch, which\nstated,\n\n          The affiant has a reasonable basis to believe that the person named in the\n          affidavit as the garnishee may have property, other than personal\n          earnings, of the judgment debtor that is not exempt under the laws of this\n          state or the United States. The property is described as money, property\n          or credits.\n\nThis affidavit was required by the then-current version of Ohio Revised Code § 2716.11\nto file for a non-wage garnishment.1 Javitch had not conducted any investigation into\nLee’s account before signing the affidavit; instead, he had relied on the investigation\ndone by JB&R staff. Javitch testified at trial that on some days he might sign as many\nas thirty or forty non-wage garnishment affidavits of this type. On July 17, the state\ncourt issued an order of garnishment to Lee’s bank. The bank debited a total of $493.22\nfrom Lee’s checking and savings accounts and remitted that amount to the court on July\n18.\n\n          Lee was notified of the garnishment by letter from her bank. She did not\nrecognize the name of the creditor, Midland, and she was surprised because she had not\nreceived any written notice of the debt at the Landis Lane address. At the time, Lee’s\nonly source of income was Social Security disability payments, which she received\nbecause complications from breast cancer surgery had greatly reduced the functionality\nof one of her arms. The garnishment of all of the money in her bank accounts resulted\n\n\n          1\n         The statute has since been amended to omit the “reasonable basis” requirement. See Ohio Rev.\nCode § 2716.11.\n\fNo. 08-4485        Lee v. Javitch, Block & Rathbone LLP                             Page 4\n\n\nin the bouncing of some of Lee’s checks. Lee testified at trial that she had been assessed\n$195.26 in fees because of the bounced checks. Lee’s inability to access her bank\naccounts also increased her stress levels and adversely affected her health by, among\nother things, exacerbating her diabetes and leading to a bladder infection. Lee did not\nhave access to any funds until August 10, when the money from her bank accounts was\nrestored after the state court determined that all of the money in her accounts had been\nreceived as Social Security disability payments.\n\n       Lee sued JB&R in federal court on September 5, 2006, alleging that JB&R had\nviolated the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA), 15 U.S.C. §§ 1692e & 1692f,\nand the Ohio Consumer Sales Practices Act (OCSPA), Ohio Rev. Code §§ 1345.02 &\n1345.03, by filing an affidavit that was false. Specifically, Lee alleged that Javitch did\nnot have the reasonable basis alleged in his affidavit when he signed that document.\nAfter denying cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court held a five-day\njury trial between January 15 and 24, 2008. A jury determined that, when Javitch signed\nthe affidavit, he did not have “a reasonable basis to believe that Plaintiff’s bank account\nmay have contained funds, other than personal earnings, that were not legally exempted\nfrom garnishment”; that the signing of the affidavit therefore violated the FDCPA and\nthe OSCPA; and that Lee was entitled to $49,603 in damages. The district court denied\nJB&R’s renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law. Post-trial motions reduced the\ndamage award to $35,595.26, but the district court also awarded Lee attorneys’ fees of\n$125,315.30. JB&R now appeals, arguing primarily that the affidavit was true and thus\nthat Lee is not entitled to relief under either the FDCPA or the OSCPA.\n\n       In the particular circumstances of this case, the dispositive question is whether,\nas a matter of Ohio law, Javitch had a reasonable basis to believe that Lee’s bank\naccount may have contained funds, other than personal earnings, that were not legally\nexempted from garnishment. Indeed, under the district court’s instructions to the jury,\n\fNo. 08-4485            Lee v. Javitch, Block & Rathbone LLP                                        Page 5\n\n\nif Javitch signed the affidavit with a reasonable basis to believe that Lee’s account may\nhave contained nonexempt funds, judgment would be entirely for the defendants.2\n\n         We are loath to overturn a jury verdict regarding whether conduct is reasonable,\nand will reverse such a verdict “only if in viewing the evidence in the light most\nfavorable to the non-moving party, . . . reasonable minds could come to but one\nconclusion, in favor of the moving party.” Ford v. County of Grand Traverse, 535 F.3d\n483, 494 (6th Cir. 2008) (quoting Sharpe v. Cureton, 319 F.3d 259, 266 (6th Cir. 2003)).\nEven applying that standard, however, reasonable minds could only come to the\nconclusion that Javitch had a reasonable basis to believe that Lee’s bank account may\nhave contained funds, other than personal earnings, that were not legally exempted from\ngarnishment. The standard imposed by the former Ohio Revised Code § 2716.11\nrequires only that the signing attorney conduct a reasonable investigation. Any\nconclusion that Javitch’s investigation was unreasonable therefore requires a conclusion\nthat additional investigation was possible and, under the circumstances, compelled by\nthat reasonableness standard.3 Lee argues on appeal, as her counsel argued before the\njury, only one additional investigative step that Javitch could have taken: subpoenaing\nLee’s bank records from her bank.4 At trial, there was conflicting testimony regarding\n\n\n         2\n           This is because JB&R did not violate either the FDCPA or the OSCPA if the affidavit signed\nby Javitch was true, and the contested part of the affidavit stated that Javitch had a “reasonable basis to\nbelieve that [Lee’s Bank] may have property, other than personal earnings, of [Lee] that is not exempt\nunder the laws of this state or the United States.” JB&R cannot be held liable for filing an affidavit with\nlanguage required by Ohio law, so long as the affidavit was not false. Such a truthful affidavit is neither\na “false, deceptive, or misleading representation” in violation of 15 U.S.C. § 1692e nor an “unfair or\nunconscionable means” in violation of 15 U.S.C. § 1692f. Filing a truthful affidavit is similarly neither\nan “unfair or deceptive act or practice” in violation of Ohio Rev. Code § 1345.02 nor an “unconscionable\nact” in violation of Ohio Rev. Code § 1345.03.\n         3\n           The testimony at trial indicated that there were only four ways to collect information relevant\nto the contents of a debtor’s bank account. JB&R attempted to use three of these ways: talking to the\ndebtor, examining public records, and ordering a credit report. At trial, the discussion of the fourth\nmethod—post-judgment discovery—focused on subpoenaing bank records, and this opinion mirrors that\nfocus. Trial testimony also stated that discovery could be served directly to the debtor, but that this form\nof discovery was ineffective because debtors typically did not respond. JB&R’s expert testified that 1-2%\nof all debtors responded to post-judgment discovery and that the response rate was even lower among those\ndebtors who, like Lee, had not returned phone calls. The expert’s firm had abandoned the service of\ndiscovery directly upon debtors because of these low response rates.\n         4\n           At oral argument, Lee also suggested that the jury may have concluded that JB&R never called\nLee, and thus that their investigation was unreasonable on this ground as well. The trial testimony does\nnot support this inference. JB&R introduced business records showing that they had placed more than fifty\ncalls to a number Lee admitted was her phone number during the relevant period. JB&R records also\n\fNo. 08-4485            Lee v. Javitch, Block & Rathbone LLP                                         Page 6\n\n\nwhether subpoenaing Lee’s bank records would have been legally possible. Lee called\nno witnesses on this question. JB&R expert Randy Slovin testified that, while he was\nnot certain, he believed that it would be possible to subpoena bank records prior to a\nnon-wage garnishment. He testified that it was unclear under current Ohio case law\nwhether such subpoenas were legally allowable, and he noted that many law firms\nbelieved that such subpoenas were not allowable. Slovin also stated that, in his twenty-\nfour years of practicing law, he had never heard anyone even suggest using a subpoena\nto obtain bank records in the context of filing for a non-wage garnishment. Javitch\ntestified at trial that he did not believe that JB&R had the legal ability to subpoena Lee’s\nbank records. Javitch, who was at the time of trial in his forty-sixth year of practicing\nlaw, also testified that he had never seen a subpoena issued to a bank prior to a non-wage\ngarnishment, nor had he heard anyone even suggest that such a subpoena was necessary\nbefore a non-wage garnishment could be issued. JB&R attorney James Rathbone stated\nthat, in his twenty-eight years of legal experience, he had never heard anyone suggest\nthat subpoenaing bank records was necessary before filing for a non-wage garnishment\norder.\n\n         Given the unanimous testimony that issuing a bank subpoena in the context of\nfiling for a non-wage garnishment was of uncertain legality and the absence of evidence\nthat it had ever been done previously, reasonableness did not demand that Javitch issue\nsuch a subpoena before signing the affidavit. Ohio tort law defines negligence as the\nfailure to conduct oneself as would “a reasonably prudent man in like circumstances;”\nand excludes from the definition of negligence “failing to take extraordinary measures\nwhich hindsight demonstrates would have been helpful.” See Bender v. First Church of\nthe Nazarene, 571 N.E.2d 475, 477 (Ohio Ct. App. 1989) (citation omitted).\nReasonableness thus demands ordinary rather than extraordinary efforts, and establishing\na reasonable basis to believe a given fact does not demand unprecedented investigation\nin a common situation.             Similar standards prevail under Federal Rule of Civil\n\n\n\nshowed that the firm had left Lee a number of voice mail messages. Lee’s response was not to dispute that\nthe calls had taken place, but she instead testified that she had not received the calls and that she had not\nchecked her voice mailbox.\n\fNo. 08-4485          Lee v. Javitch, Block & Rathbone LLP                                  Page 7\n\n\nProcedure 11, which contains a reasonable inquiry requirement analogous to the\n“reasonable basis” requirement imposed by the former Ohio Revised Code § 2716.11.\nThis court has held that “[t]he determination of whether an attorney conducted\n‘reasonable inquiry’ is judged by objective norms of what reasonable attorneys would\nhave done.” Silverman v. Mut. Trust Life Ins. Co. (In re Big Rapids Mall Assocs.), 98\nF.3d 926, 930 (6th Cir. 1996).5 The evidence does not support a conclusion that\nreasonable attorneys would have subpoenaed Lee’s bank records, as there was no\nevidence that any attorney, reasonable or unreasonable, had ever issued a subpoena in\nan analogous situation. Thus, because Lee did not establish that a reasonable attorney\nwould have conducted additional investigation, JB&R was entitled to judgment as a\nmatter of law.\n\n        This conclusion is consistent with the text of former Ohio Revised Code\n§ 2716.11. That provision required only that the affiant have “a reasonable basis to\nbelieve” that Lee’s bank “may have” nonexempt property of Lee’s. The “may have”\nlanguage indicates that this requirement was not meant to require that the signing\nattorney have specific evidence about whether the property at issue was exempt with\nrespect to every exemption provided by Ohio or federal law. Rather, the requirement\nmust be that the attorney seeking the garnishment must investigate reasonably available\ninformation and ensure that none of that information includes a clear suggestion that the\ndebtor’s bank account contains exempt funds. This was the general procedure followed\nby JB&R, and the only question presented by Lee was whether subpoenaed bank records\nfell within the category of reasonably available information. In light of the testimony\nthat such subpoenas were not clearly legal, and absent any testimony that anyone had\never issued such a subpoena in a similar circumstance, reasonableness did not demand\nthat Javitch subpoena Lee’s records before signing the affidavit. The only reasonable\nconclusion is that the affidavit was true.\n\n\n\n\n        5\n          Silverman concerned Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 9011. Silverman, 98 F.3d at 930.\nBecause of the similarity of Bankruptcy Procedure Rule 9011 and Civil Procedure Rule 11, Silverman\napplied this circuit’s Rule 11 jurisprudence.

Javitch, Block & Rathbone LLP                   Page 8\n\n\n       For these reasons, we REVERSE the judgment of the district court and\nREMAND this case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\f",

After obtaining a default judgment in state court against Lee, JB &amp; R attorney Victor Javitch filed for a non-wage garnishment of Lee's bank account. To do so, Javitch signed and filed a required affidavit stating that he had a \"reasonable basis to believe that [Lee's Bank] may have property, other than personal earnings, of [Lee] that is not exempt under the laws of this state or the United States.\" The state court initially garnished the money from Lee's bank accounts, but the court later returned the money after Lee proved that the account contained only Social Security disability payments, which are exempt funds. Lee then sued JB &amp; R, contending <span class=\"star-pagination\">*656</span> that Javitch did not have the reasonable basis claimed in the affidavit, and thus that his signing and filing of the affidavit violated the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and the Ohio Consumer Sales Practices Act. Because Lee did not establish at trial that reasonableness demanded any additional investigation of Lee's bank accounts, she did not prove that Javitch's affidavit was false. Lee is therefore not entitled to relief.</p>\n<p>JB &amp; R represented Midland Funding, LLC (Midland) in its attempts to collect a $2,795.75 credit card debt originally owed on an Aspire Visa. In February, 2006, Midland provided information to JB &amp; R indicating that the debt was owed by Norma Lee and that Lee resided on Birchridge Drive in Cincinnati, Ohio. On February 16, JB &amp; R sent a validation notice as required by 15 U.S.C. § 1692g(a) to the Birchridge Drive address, but JB &amp; R did not receive any response. Before February 16, Lee had moved from Birchridge Drive to Landis Lane, but JB &amp; R did not have notice of her move. In February and early March, JB &amp; R Recovery Specialist Frank Stefanelli assessed whether the debt was collectible. Following JB &amp; R procedures, Stefanelli determined the following: First, Lee was below retirement age, so it was less likely that she was receiving Social Security retirement payments. Second, the zip code containing the Birchridge Drive address had a median income of $43,588, so it was more likely that Lee would be capable of repaying the debt. Third, Lee was not listed as a property owner in the county containing the Birchridge Drive address. Fourth, Lee's credit report listed no medical debts, which might have been an indication that Lee was receiving disability payments, and the report neither indicated that the Midland debt was disputed nor contained any suggestions that Lee had been the victim of identity theft. Additionally, JB &amp; R called Lee multiple times during this period, but she neither answered the phone nor returned JB &amp; R's voice mails. Lee testified at trial that she had never received any of these calls. Stefanelli concluded that this information indicated that the debt was collectible, and on March 8, he recommended to his superiors that JB &amp; R file a collections suit against Lee. JB &amp; R filed suit against Lee on April 11, 2006, in Ohio municipal court and obtained a default judgment for $2,795.75. On July 12, JB &amp; R filed for a non-wage garnishment of Lee's bank account in the same Ohio municipal court. Attached to the filing was an affidavit, signed by JB &amp; R attorney Victor Javitch, which stated,</p>\n<blockquote>The affiant has a reasonable basis to believe that the person named in the affidavit as the garnishee may have property, other than personal earnings, of the judgment debtor that is not exempt under the laws of this state or the United States. The property is described as money, property or credits.</blockquote>\n<p>This affidavit was required by the then-current version of Ohio Revised Code § 2716.11 to file for a non-wage garnishment.<sup>[1]</sup> Javitch had not conducted any investigation into Lee's account before signing the affidavit; instead, he had relied on the investigation done by JB &amp; R staff. Javitch testified at trial that on some days he might sign as many as thirty or forty non-wage garnishment affidavits of this type. On July 17, the state court issued an order of garnishment to Lee's bank. The bank debited a total of $493.22 from Lee's checking and savings accounts and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*657</span> remitted that amount to the court on July 18.</p>\n<p>Lee was notified of the garnishment by letter from her bank. She did not recognize the name of the creditor, Midland, and she was surprised because she had not received any written notice of the debt at the Landis Lane address. At the time, Lee's only source of income was Social Security disability payments, which she received because complications from breast cancer surgery had greatly reduced the functionality of one of her arms. The garnishment of all of the money in her bank accounts resulted in the bouncing of some of Lee's checks. Lee testified at trial that she had been assessed $195.26 in fees because of the bounced checks. Lee's inability to access her bank accounts also increased her stress levels and adversely affected her health by, among other things, exacerbating her diabetes and leading to a bladder infection. Lee did not have access to any funds until August 10, when the money from her bank accounts was restored after the state court determined that all of the money in her accounts had been received as Social Security disability payments.</p>\n<p>Lee sued JB &amp; R in federal court on September 5, 2006, alleging that JB &amp; R had violated the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA), 15 U.S.C. §§ 1692e &amp; 1692f, and the Ohio Consumer Sales Practices Act (OCSPA), Ohio Rev. Code §§ 1345.02 &amp; 1345.03, by filing an affidavit that was false. Specifically, Lee alleged that Javitch did not have the reasonable basis alleged in his affidavit when he signed that document. After denying cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court held a five-day jury trial between January 15 and 24, 2008. A jury determined that, when Javitch signed the affidavit, he did not have \"a reasonable basis to believe that Plaintiff's bank account may have contained funds, other than personal earnings, that were not legally exempted from garnishment\"; that the signing of the affidavit therefore violated the FDCPA and the OSCPA; and that Lee was entitled to $49,603 in damages. The district court denied JB &amp; R's renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law. Post-trial motions reduced the damage award to $35,595.26, but the district court also awarded Lee attorneys' fees of $125,315.30. JB &amp; R now appeals, arguing primarily that the affidavit was true and thus that Lee is not entitled to relief under either the FDCPA or the OSCPA.</p>\n<p>In the particular circumstances of this case, the dispositive question is whether, as a matter of Ohio law, Javitch had a reasonable basis to believe that Lee's bank account may have contained funds, other than personal earnings, that were not legally exempted from garnishment. Indeed, under the district court's instructions to the jury, if Javitch signed the affidavit with a reasonable basis to believe that Lee's account may have contained nonexempt funds, judgment would be entirely for the defendants.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*658</span> We are loath to overturn a jury verdict regarding whether conduct is reasonable, and will reverse such a verdict \"only if in viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party,... reasonable minds could come to but one conclusion, in favor of the moving party.\" <i>Ford v. County of Grand Traverse,</i> 535 F.3d 483, 494 (6th Cir.2008) (quoting <i>Sharpe v. Cureton,</i> 319 F.3d 259, 266 (6th Cir.2003)). Even applying that standard, however, reasonable minds could only come to the conclusion that Javitch had a reasonable basis to believe that Lee's bank account may have contained funds, other than personal earnings, that were not legally exempted from garnishment. The standard imposed by the former Ohio Revised Code § 2716.11 requires only that the signing attorney conduct a reasonable investigation. Any conclusion that Javitch's investigation was unreasonable therefore requires a conclusion that additional investigation was possible and, under the circumstances, compelled by that reasonableness standard.<sup>[3]</sup> Lee argues on appeal, as her counsel argued before the jury, only one additional investigative step that Javitch could have taken: subpoenaing Lee's bank records from her bank.<sup>[4]</sup> At trial, there was conflicting testimony regarding whether subpoenaing Lee's bank records would have been legally possible. Lee called no witnesses on this question. JB &amp; R expert Randy Slovin testified that, while he was not certain, he believed that it would be possible to subpoena bank records prior to a non-wage garnishment. He testified that it was unclear under current Ohio case law whether such subpoenas were legally allowable, and he noted that many law firms believed that such subpoenas were not allowable. Slovin also stated that, in his twenty-four years of practicing law, he had never heard anyone even suggest using a subpoena to obtain bank records in the context of filing for a non-wage garnishment. Javitch testified at trial that he did not believe that JB &amp; R had the legal ability to subpoena Lee's bank records. Javitch, who was at the time of trial in his forty-sixth year of practicing law, also testified that he had never seen a subpoena issued to a bank prior to a non-wage garnishment, nor had he heard anyone even suggest that such a subpoena was necessary before a non-wage garnishment could be issued. JB &amp; R attorney James Rathbone stated that, in his twenty-eight years of legal experience, he had never heard anyone suggest that subpoenaing bank records <span class=\"star-pagination\">*659</span> was necessary before filing for a non-wage garnishment order.</p>\n<p>Given the unanimous testimony that issuing a bank subpoena in the context of filing for a non-wage garnishment was of uncertain legality and the absence of evidence that it had ever been done previously, reasonableness did not demand that Javitch issue such a subpoena before signing the affidavit. Ohio tort law defines negligence as the failure to conduct oneself as would \"a reasonably prudent man in like circumstances;\" and excludes from the definition of negligence \"failing to take extraordinary measures which hindsight demonstrates would have been helpful.\" <i>See Bender v. First Church of the Nazarene,</i> 59 Ohio App.3d 68, 571 N.E.2d 475, 477 (1989) (citation omitted). Reasonableness thus demands ordinary rather than extraordinary efforts, and establishing a reasonable basis to believe a given fact does not demand unprecedented investigation in a common situation. Similar standards prevail under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11, which contains a reasonable inquiry requirement analogous to the \"reasonable basis\" requirement imposed by the former Ohio Revised Code § 2716.11. This court has held that \"[t]he determination of whether an attorney conducted `reasonable inquiry' is judged by objective norms of what reasonable attorneys would have done.\" <i>Silverman v. Mut. Trust Life Ins. Co.</i> (In re <i>Big Rapids Mall Assocs.),</i> 98 F.3d 926, 930 (6th Cir.1996).<sup>[5]</sup> The evidence does not support a conclusion that reasonable attorneys would have subpoenaed Lee's bank records, as there was no evidence that any attorney, reasonable or unreasonable, had ever issued a subpoena in an analogous situation. Thus, because Lee did not establish that a reasonable attorney would have conducted additional investigation, JB &amp; R was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p>This conclusion is consistent with the text of former Ohio Revised Code § 2716.11. That provision required only that the affiant have \"a reasonable basis to believe\" that Lee's bank \"may have\" nonexempt property of Lee's. The \"may have\" language indicates that this requirement was not meant to require that the signing attorney have specific evidence about whether the property at issue was exempt with respect to every exemption provided by Ohio or federal law. Rather, the requirement must be that the attorney seeking the garnishment must investigate reasonably available information and ensure that none of that information includes a clear suggestion that the debtor's bank account contains exempt funds. This was the general procedure followed by JB &amp; R, and the only question presented by Lee was whether subpoenaed bank records fell within the category of reasonably available information. In light of the testimony that such subpoenas were not clearly legal, and absent any testimony that anyone had ever issued such a subpoena in a similar circumstance, reasonableness did not demand that Javitch subpoena Lee's records before signing the affidavit. The only reasonable conclusion is that the affidavit was true.</p>\n<p>For these reasons, we REVERSE the judgment of the district court and REMAND this case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The statute has since been amended to omit the \"reasonable basis\" requirement. <i>See</i> Ohio Rev.Code § 2716.11.</p>\n<p>[2]  This is because JB &amp; R did not violate either the FDCPA or the OSCPA if the affidavit signed by Javitch was true, and the contested part of the affidavit stated that Javitch had a \"reasonable basis to believe that [Lee's Bank] may have property, other than personal earnings, of [Lee] that is not exempt under the laws of this state or the United States.\" JB &amp; R cannot be held liable for filing an affidavit with language required by Ohio law, so long as the affidavit was not false. Such a truthful affidavit is neither a \"false, deceptive, or misleading representation\" in violation of 15 U.S.C. § 1692e nor an \"unfair or unconscionable means\" in violation of 15 U.S.C. § 1692f. Filing a truthful affidavit is similarly neither an \"unfair or deceptive act or practice\" in violation of Ohio Rev.Code § 1345.02 nor an \"unconscionable act\" in violation of Ohio Rev.Code § 1345.03.</p>\n<p>[3]  The testimony at trial indicated that there were only four ways to collect information relevant to the contents of a debtor's bank account. JB &amp; R attempted to use three of these ways: talking to the debtor, examining public records, and ordering a credit report. At trial, the discussion of the fourth method  post-judgment discovery  focused on subpoenaing bank records, and this opinion mirrors that focus. Trial testimony also stated that discovery could be served directly to the debtor, but that this form of discovery was ineffective because debtors typically did not respond. JB &amp; R's expert testified that 1-2% of all debtors responded to post-judgment discovery and that the response rate was even lower among those debtors who, like Lee, had not returned phone calls. The expert's firm had abandoned the service of discovery directly upon debtors because of these low response rates.</p>\n<p>[4]  At oral argument, Lee also suggested that the jury may have concluded that JB &amp; R never called Lee, and thus that their investigation was unreasonable on this ground as well. The trial testimony does not support this inference. JB &amp; R introduced business records showing that they had placed more than fifty calls to a number Lee admitted was her phone number during the relevant period. JB &amp; R records also showed that the firm had left Lee a number of voice mail messages. Lee's response was not to dispute that the calls had taken place, but she instead testified that she had not received the calls and that she had not checked her voice mailbox.</p>\n<p>[5]  <i>Silverman</i> concerned Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 9011. <i>Silverman,</i> 98 F.3d at 930.

Raab, United States Department of Justice, Washington, DC, for Intervenor.</p>\n<p>Before: MARTIN, ROGERS, and COOK, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>OPINION</h2>\n<p>ROGERS, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>Javitch, Block &amp; Rathbone (JB &amp; R) represented a client who attempted to collect a credit card debt from Norma Lee. After obtaining a default judgment in state court against Lee, JB &amp; R attorney Victor Javitch filed for a non-wage garnishment of Lee's bank account. To do so, Javitch signed and filed a required affidavit stating that he had a \"reasonable basis to believe that [Lee's Bank] may have property, other than personal earnings, of [Lee] that is not exempt under the laws of this state or the United States.\" The state court initially garnished the money from Lee's bank accounts, but the court later returned the money after Lee proved that the account contained only Social Security disability payments, which are exempt funds. Lee then sued JB &amp; R, contending <span class=\"star-pagination\">*656</span> that Javitch did not have the reasonable basis claimed in the affidavit, and thus that his signing and filing of the affidavit violated the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and the Ohio Consumer Sales Practices Act. Because Lee did not establish at trial that reasonableness demanded any additional investigation of Lee's bank accounts, she did not prove that Javitch's affidavit was false. Lee is therefore not entitled to relief.</p>\n<p>JB &amp; R represented Midland Funding, LLC (Midland) in its attempts to collect a $2,795.75 credit card debt originally owed on an Aspire Visa. In February, 2006, Midland provided information to JB &amp; R indicating that the debt was owed by Norma Lee and that Lee resided on Birchridge Drive in Cincinnati, Ohio. On February 16, JB &amp; R sent a validation notice as required by 15 U.S.C. § 1692g(a) to the Birchridge Drive address, but JB &amp; R did not receive any response. Before February 16, Lee had moved from Birchridge Drive to Landis Lane, but JB &amp; R did not have notice of her move. In February and early March, JB &amp; R Recovery Specialist Frank Stefanelli assessed whether the debt was collectible. Following JB &amp; R procedures, Stefanelli determined the following: First, Lee was below retirement age, so it was less likely that she was receiving Social Security retirement payments. Second, the zip code containing the Birchridge Drive address had a median income of $43,588, so it was more likely that Lee would be capable of repaying the debt. Third, Lee was not listed as a property owner in the county containing the Birchridge Drive address. Fourth, Lee's credit report listed no medical debts, which might have been an indication that Lee was receiving disability payments, and the report neither indicated that the Midland debt was disputed nor contained any suggestions that Lee had been the victim of identity theft. Additionally, JB &amp; R called Lee multiple times during this period, but she neither answered the phone nor returned JB &amp; R's voice mails. Lee testified at trial that she had never received any of these calls. Stefanelli concluded that this information indicated that the debt was collectible, and on March 8, he recommended to his superiors that JB &amp; R file a collections suit against Lee. JB &amp; R filed suit against Lee on April 11, 2006, in Ohio municipal court and obtained a default judgment for $2,795.75. On July 12, JB &amp; R filed for a non-wage garnishment of Lee's bank account in the same Ohio municipal court. Attached to the filing was an affidavit, signed by JB &amp; R attorney Victor Javitch, which stated,</p>\n<blockquote>The affiant has a reasonable basis to believe that the person named in the affidavit as the garnishee may have property, other than personal earnings, of the judgment debtor that is not exempt under the laws of this state or the United States. The property is described as money, property or credits.</blockquote>\n<p>This affidavit was required by the then-current version of Ohio Revised Code § 2716.11 to file for a non-wage garnishment.<sup>[1]</sup> Javitch had not conducted any investigation into Lee's account before signing the affidavit; instead, he had relied on the investigation done by JB &amp; R staff. Javitch testified at trial that on some days he might sign as many as thirty or forty non-wage garnishment affidavits of this type. On July 17, the state court issued an order of garnishment to Lee's bank. The bank debited a total of $493.22 from Lee's checking and savings accounts and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*657</span> remitted that amount to the court on July 18.</p>\n<p>Lee was notified of the garnishment by letter from her bank. She did not recognize the name of the creditor, Midland, and she was surprised because she had not received any written notice of the debt at the Landis Lane address. At the time, Lee's only source of income was Social Security disability payments, which she received because complications from breast cancer surgery had greatly reduced the functionality of one of her arms. The garnishment of all of the money in her bank accounts resulted in the bouncing of some of Lee's checks. Lee testified at trial that she had been assessed $195.26 in fees because of the bounced checks. Lee's inability to access her bank accounts also increased her stress levels and adversely affected her health by, among other things, exacerbating her diabetes and leading to a bladder infection. Lee did not have access to any funds until August 10, when the money from her bank accounts was restored after the state court determined that all of the money in her accounts had been received as Social Security disability payments.</p>\n<p>Lee sued JB &amp; R in federal court on September 5, 2006, alleging that JB &amp; R had violated the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA), 15 U.S.C. §§ 1692e &amp; 1692f, and the Ohio Consumer Sales Practices Act (OCSPA), Ohio Rev. Code §§ 1345.02 &amp; 1345.03, by filing an affidavit that was false. Specifically, Lee alleged that Javitch did not have the reasonable basis alleged in his affidavit when he signed that document. After denying cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court held a five-day jury trial between January 15 and 24, 2008. A jury determined that, when Javitch signed the affidavit, he did not have \"a reasonable basis to believe that Plaintiff's bank account may have contained funds, other than personal earnings, that were not legally exempted from garnishment\"; that the signing of the affidavit therefore violated the FDCPA and the OSCPA; and that Lee was entitled to $49,603 in damages. The district court denied JB &amp; R's renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law. Post-trial motions reduced the damage award to $35,595.26, but the district court also awarded Lee attorneys' fees of $125,315.30.
