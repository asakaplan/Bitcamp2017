Courtland and Michelle Bishop and their minor disabled\nson CB1 brought suit against the private school to which CB had been assigned just less\nthan three years after the school expelled CB. Ohio’s statute of limitations, which is\napplied to their federal constitutional claims, bars suit after two years. They argued their\nclaims were statutorily tolled under Ohio’s minority tolling statute. The district court\ndid not address this argument but instead dismissed the claims as time-barred, because\nit concluded that equitable tolling was not appropriate. We REVERSE and REMAND\nthe decision of the district court.\n\n                  FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n        The Bishops reside with their minor son CB in the Worthington, Ohio School\nDistrict. Because of a disability, CB was placed at Oakstone Academy (“Oakstone”).\nThe Oakstone school is a portion of the Children’s Center for Developmental\nEnrichment’s (“CCDE”) non-profit business. Oakstone provided educational services\nto CB pursuant to his Individualized Education Plan (“IEP”) beginning in 2002.\nWorthington School District contracted with Oakstone to provide these services.\n\n        In 2005, CB was slated for placement in a transition pre-K classroom for the\nfollowing year. On August 16, 2005, however, the Bishops learned that CB had actually\nbeen retained in the previous level preschool classroom, rather than progressing to the\npre-K classroom as envisioned by the IEP. They allege that their attempts to discuss this\nissue with school personnel were ignored, and the Bishops claim that they were ordered\non the first day of school to take CB home until Rebecca Morrison, the director of\n\n\n\n\n        1\n           Throughout this opinion “the Bishops” will refer to Courtland and Michelle Bishop, “CB” will\nrefer to their minor son, and “Plaintiffs” will refer to the Bishops and CB collectively.\n\fNo. 09-3383        Bishop, et al. v. Children’s Center for                        Page 3\n                   Developmental Enrichment, et al.\n\n\nOakstone, could talk to them. On August 31, 2005, Morrison decided that CB no longer\nhad a place at Oakstone.\n\n       Plaintiffs filed a complaint notice and request for due process hearing with the\nOhio Department of Education on October 25, 2005, but withdrew the complaint and\nhearing request before the hearing.\n\n       On May 20, 2006, the Bishops, on behalf of themselves and CB, filed suit in U.S.\nDistrict Court, alleging that they were damaged as a result of CB’s expulsion. They\nsought relief under § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794\n(“Rehabilitation Act”), the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C.\n§ 12131, et seq., the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act\n(“IDEIA”), 20 U.S.C. § 1400, and 42 U.S.C. § 1983. On March 5, 2007, the district\ncourt dismissed for failure to exhaust administrative remedies under the IDEIA. In\ndoing so it reasoned that Plaintiffs could not circumvent the exhaustion requirements of\nthe IDEIA by also bringing claims under the Rehabilitation Act, the ADA, or § 1983.\n\n       On August 14, 2007, Plaintiffs filed an administrative due process complaint\nagainst Worthington Schools, the Ohio Department of Education, and CCDE. On\nOctober 16, 2007, the District Level Hearing Officer concluded that the complaint failed\nto state a claim against CCDE on which relief could be granted. Plaintiffs then requested\nState Level Review, which was denied. The decision was made final in a second\ndecision on March 17, 2008. Plaintiffs’ claims against Worthington Schools proceeded\nthrough the administrative process, and a final decision was issued on June 12, 2008.\n\n       On August 8, 2008, the Bishops again filed suit in federal court, individually and\non behalf of CB. They alleged causes of action under the Rehabilitation Act, § 1983,\nand Ohio law against CCDE, Worthington Schools, and Morrison as defendants. The\ndistrict court found that the suit was time-barred and granted summary judgment for the\nDefendants. It reasoned that the claims accrued at the time of the injury, not after\nadministrative exhaustion, as Plaintiffs argued. Consequently, it found that equitable\n\fNo. 09-3383             Bishop, et al. v. Children’s Center for                                        Page 4\n                        Developmental Enrichment, et al.\n\n\ntolling was inapplicable, but did not address the minority2 statutory tolling argument\nraised by Plaintiffs.\n\n                                     STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n         We review a district court’s grant of summary judgment de novo, viewing the\nfacts and inferences drawn from those facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving\nparty. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587 (1986);\nBennett v. City of Eastpointe, 410 F.3d 810, 817 (6th Cir. 2005).\n\n                                              DISCUSSION\n\nI. Accrual of Plaintiffs’ Claims and the Statute of Limitations\n\n         Since neither the Rehabilitation Act, nor § 1983 contains a limitations period, see\nJames v. Upper Arlington City Sch. Dist., 228 F.3d 764, 769 (6th Cir. 2000) (citing\nSoutherland v. Hardaway Mgmt. Inc., 41 F.3d 250, 254 (6th Cir. 1994) (Rehabilitation\nAct), and Wilson v. Garcia, 471 U.S. 261, 266-67 (1985) (§1983)), the most appropriate\nor analogous Ohio limitations period applies to Plaintiffs’ claims under these statutes.\nSee Wilson, 471 U.S. at 266-67. The nearest analogous statute for both claims is Ohio\nRevised Code § 2305.10, which provides a two-year statute of limitations period. See\nLRL Props. v. Portage Metro Housing Auth., 55 F.3d 1097, 1105 (6th Cir. 1995)\n(§1983); Lewis v. LaFayette County Detention Ctr., No. 99-5538, 2000 WL 556132, at\n*2 (6th Cir. April 28, 2000) (Rehabilitation Act). Consequently, Plaintiffs had two years\nfrom the time their claims accrued in which to file.\n\n         Although the statutes of limitations for both the Rehabilitation Act and § 1983\nare borrowed from state law, the actions accrue and the statutory period begins to run\naccording to federal law. See Wallace v. Kato, 549 U.S. 384, 388 (2007); Southerland,\n41 F.3d at 254. The general federal rule is that “the statute of limitations begins to run\nwhen the reasonable person knows, or in the exercise of due diligence should have\n\n\n         2\n           Plaintiffs do not raise the question of disability tolling, and we are not deciding the applicability\nof that rule. See Ohio Rev. Code. § 2305.16.\n\fNo. 09-3383         Bishop, et al. v. Children’s Center for                          Page 5\n                    Developmental Enrichment, et al.\n\n\nknown, both his injury and the cause of that injury.” Campbell v. Grand Trunk W. R.R.\nCo., 238 F.3d 772, 775 (6th Cir. 2001).\n\n        Consequently, Plaintiffs’ claims accrued on August 31, 2005, when they knew\nthat CB had been expelled from Oakstone because of the Bishops’ inquiries into his class\nassignment. It is irrelevant that Plaintiffs also had an administrative remedy available\nto them at that point, or that they were required to exhaust that remedy before bringing\nsuit; redress was available at the time of the injury. Cf James, 228 F.3d at 769.\nPlaintiffs had until August 31, 2007, to file their claims under the Rehabilitation Act or\n§1983, and the district court correctly concluded that the claim accrued and the statutory\nperiod began running on August 31, 2005.\n\nII. Statutory Tolling for Minority under Ohio Law\n\n        When the statute of limitations is borrowed from state law, so too are the state’s\ntolling provisions, except when they are “inconsistent with the federal policy underlying\nthe cause of action under consideration.” Bd. of Regents v. Tomanio, 446 U.S. 478, 485\n(1980). In Ohio, unless otherwise provided, if a person was within the age of minority\nat the time his claim accrued, he may bring the claim within the statutory period after the\ndisability was removed. See Ohio Rev. Code. § 2305.16. If the minor plaintiff’s claims\nare joint and inseparable with the claims of other parties, they too can benefit from his\ndisability and bring their claims within the statutory period after his disability ends. Id.\n\n        CB was a minor when his claim accrued, meaning that Ohio’s minority tolling\nprovision applies to his case unless it would be “inconsistent with the federal policy\nunderlying [his] cause of action” under §1983 or the Rehabilitation Act. See Bd. of\nRegents, 449 U.S. at 485. The Supreme Court’s language focuses our inquiry on “the\nfederal statute at issue,” Hardin v. Straub, 490 U.S. 536, 539 (1989), in other words, “the\ncause of action under consideration.” Bd. of Regents, 446 U.S. at 485. The federal\nstatutes at issue are § 1983 and the Rehabilitation Act, and we have not previously\ndecided whether Ohio’s minority tolling statute is inconsistent with either of these\nstatutes.\n\fNo. 09-3383        Bishop, et al. v. Children’s Center for                              Page 6\n                   Developmental Enrichment, et al.\n\n\n       The chief goals of § 1983 are compensation and deterrence, and its subsidiary\ngoals are uniformity and federalism. Hardin, 490 U.S. at 539. Applying Ohio’s\nminority tolling statute does not undermine either of these goals. As the Supreme Court\nexplained in Hardin:\n\n       A State’s decision to toll the statute of limitations during the [plaintiff’s]\n       disability does not frustrate § 1983’s compensation goal. Rather, it\n       enhances the [plaintiff]’s ability to bring suit and recover damages for\n       injuries. Nor does the State’s decision to toll its statute of limitations\n       hinder § 1983’s deterrence interest. In the event an official’s misconduct\n       is ongoing, the plaintiff will have an interest in enjoining it; thus, the\n       time during which the official will unknowingly violate the Constitution\n       may well be short. The State also may have decided that if the official\n       knows an act is unconstitutional, the risk that he or she might be haled\n       into court indefinitely is more likely to check misbehavior than the\n       knowledge that he or she might escape a challenge to that conduct within\n       a brief period of time.\n\n490 U.S. at 543. Thus, “[t]olling is neither inconsistent with nor required by § 1983’s\ngoal of compensating persons whose constitutional rights have been violated.” Id. at\n542. Furthermore, while we have not dealt specifically with Ohio’s minority tolling\nstatute in the § 1983 context, we held, in an unpublished decision, that Michigan’s\nminority tolling statute could apply in a §1983 case to allow an otherwise time-barred\nclaim to proceed. See Hawkins v. Czarnecki, No. 96-2437, 1998 U.S. App. Lexis 1690,\nat *9-10 (6th Cir. Feb. 2, 1998); cf. Austin v. Brammer, 555 F.2d 142, 143-44 (6th Cir.\n1977) (recognizing the applicability of Ohio’s statute, which allows tolling for\nimprisonment, in the §1983 context).\n\n       We have not previously examined the compatibility of Ohio’s tolling statute with\nthe Rehabilitation Act, but we have recognized that it is “is a ‘civil rights statute . . .\nclosely analogous to section 1983.’” Hall v. Knott County Bd. of Educ., 941 F.2d 402,\n408 (6th Cir. 1991) (quoting Alexopulos v. San Francisco Unified Sch. Dist., 817 F.2d\n551, 554 (9th Cir. 1987)). Consistent with that recognition, we have applied the same\nstate-law limitations period to Rehabilitation Act claims as to § 1983 claims.\nSoutherland, 41 F.3d at 254. Thus, Ohio’s tolling provisions apply to CB’s claims\n\fNo. 09-3383        Bishop, et al. v. Children’s Center for                          Page 7\n                   Developmental Enrichment, et al.\n\n\nbecause the minority tolling statute is not inconsistent with § 1983, and the\nRehabilitation Act’s goal of protecting individuals with handicaps from discrimination,\nsee Baker v. Bd. of Regents, 991 F.2d 628, 631-32 (10th Cir. 1993), is not undermined\nby allowing minority tolling. See Hickey v. Irving Indep. Sch. Dist., 976 F.2d 980, 983-\n84 (5th Cir. 1992) (reversing and remanding a district court’s decision that a plaintiff’s\nclaims were time-barred under the Rehabilitation Act because the court had failed to\nconsider whether Texas’s minority tolling statute was applicable).\n\n       The Bishops’ claims are also tolled by virtue of CB’s minority. According to\nOhio’s tolling provisions, a third-party’s claims are tolled based on the disability of one\nparty when the third-party’s claims are “joint and inseparable” from the disabled party’s\nclaims. See Ohio Rev. Code. § 2305.16. Under Ohio law, claims can be “joint and\ninseparable” even though they are “separate and distinct.” Fehrenback v. O’Malley, 841\nN.E.2d 350, 366 (Ohio Ct. App. 2005). The Bishops seek monetary losses and loss of\nconsortium, and these claims are derivative of CB’s constitutional claims because they\narose from his expulsion from Oakstone. See id. (reasoning that parents’ claims for loss\nof consortium and medical expenses were derivative of the minor child’s malpractice\nclaim because all three claims “arose out of the same allegedly tortious act,” even though\nthe parents’ injuries were separate and distinct and the single alleged wrong gave rise\nto two separate and distinct claims: one on behalf the child for personal injury and one\non behalf of the parents for loss of consortium and medical expenses); see also Loudin\nv. Mills, No. C-990569, 2000 Ohio App. Lexis 2006, at *12-13 (Ohio Ct. App. May 12,\n2000) (recognizing parents’ claims for loss of consortium and reimbursement for\nincurred losses as derivative claims of their son’s claims of sexual assault, which were\nthereby subject to the same statute of limitations and minority tolling as their son’s\nclaim, and characterizing their claims for negligent and intentional infliction of\nemotional distress as separate claims that were nevertheless tolled during the minority\nof their son). Since we conclude that both CB’s and the Bishops’ federal law claims\nwere subject to minority tolling and therefore not barred by the statute of limitations, we\nreverse and remand the district court’s decision as to these claims.\n\fNo. 09-3383        Bishop, et al. v. Children’s Center for                          Page 8\n                   Developmental Enrichment, et al.\n\n\nIII. State Law Claims\n\n       When all the federal claims in a case have been dismissed, there is a strong\npresumption in favor of dismissing any remaining state law claims unless the plaintiff\ncan establish an alternate basis for federal jurisdiction. See 28 U.S.C § 1367; United\nMine Workers v. Gibbs, 383 U.S. 715, 726 (1966). Consequently, the district court did\nnot err in dismissing Plaintiffs’ state law claims upon its dismissal of the federal claims\nin this case. Nevertheless, because we reverse the district court’s decision on Plaintiffs’\nfederal claims, we also reverse the district court’s decision on their state law claims.\nSince the district court will once again have federal claims before it, we remand the state\nlaw claims to the district court to allow it to determine whether to exercise supplemental\njurisdiction in light of this change in circumstances.\n\n       REVERSED AND REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this\nopinion.\n\f",

Because of a disability, CB was placed at Oakstone Academy (\"Oakstone\"). The Oakstone school is a portion of the Children's Center for Developmental Enrichment's (\"CCDE\") non-profit business. Oakstone provided educational services to CB pursuant to his Individualized Education Plan (\"IEP\") beginning in 2002. Worthington School District contracted with Oakstone to provide these services.</p>\n<p>In 2005, CB was slated for placement in a transition pre-K classroom for the following year. On August 16, 2005, however, the Bishops learned that CB had actually been retained in the previous level preschool classroom, rather than progressing to the pre-K classroom as envisioned by the IEP. They allege that their attempts to discuss this issue with school personnel were ignored, and the Bishops claim that they were ordered on the first day of school to take CB home until Rebecca Morrison, the director of Oakstone, could talk to them. On August 31, 2005, Morrison decided that CB no longer had a place at Oakstone.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs filed a complaint notice and request for due process hearing with the Ohio Department of Education on October 25, 2005, but withdrew the complaint and hearing request before the hearing.</p>\n<p>On May 20, 2006, the Bishops, on behalf of themselves and CB, filed suit in U.S. District Court, alleging that they were damaged as a result of CB's expulsion. They sought relief under § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794 (\"Rehabilitation Act\"), the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C. § 12131, <i>et seq.,</i> the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act (\"IDEIA\"), 20 U.S.C. § 1400, and 42 U.S.C. § 1983. On March 5, 2007, the district court dismissed for failure to exhaust administrative remedies under the IDEIA. In doing so it reasoned that Plaintiffs could not circumvent the exhaustion requirements of the IDEIA by also bringing <span class=\"star-pagination\">*536</span> claims under the Rehabilitation Act, the ADA, or § 1983.</p>\n<p>On August 14, 2007, Plaintiffs filed an administrative due process complaint against Worthington Schools, the Ohio Department of Education, and CCDE. On October 16, 2007, the District Level Hearing Officer concluded that the complaint failed to state a claim against CCDE on which relief could be granted. Plaintiffs then requested State Level Review, which was denied. The decision was made final in a second decision on March 17, 2008. Plaintiffs' claims against Worthington Schools proceeded through the administrative process, and a final decision was issued on June 12, 2008.</p>\n<p>On August 8, 2008, the Bishops again filed suit in federal court, individually and on behalf of CB. They alleged causes of action under the Rehabilitation Act, § 1983, and Ohio law against CCDE, Worthington Schools, and Morrison as defendants. The district court found that the suit was time-barred and granted summary judgment for the Defendants. It reasoned that the claims accrued at the time of the injury, not after administrative exhaustion, as Plaintiffs argued. Consequently, it found that equitable tolling was inapplicable, but did not address the minority<sup>[2]</sup> statutory tolling argument raised by Plaintiffs.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>STANDARD OF REVIEW</h2>\n<p>We review a district court's grant of summary judgment de novo, viewing the facts and inferences drawn from those facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <i>Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp.,</i> 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986); <i>Bennett v. City of Eastpointe,</i> 410 F.3d 810, 817 (6th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>DISCUSSION</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>I. Accrual of Plaintiffs' Claims and the Statute of Limitations</i></h2>\n<p>Since neither the Rehabilitation Act, nor § 1983 contains a limitations period, <i>see </i><i>James v. Upper Arlington City Sch. Dist.,</i> 228 F.3d 764, 769 (6th Cir.2000) (citing <i>Southerland v. Hardaway Mgmt. Inc.,</i> 41 F.3d 250, 254 (6th Cir.1994) (Rehabilitation Act), and <i>Wilson v. Garcia,</i> 471 U.S. 261, 266-67, 105 S.Ct. 1938, 85 L.Ed.2d 254 (1985) (§ 1983)), the most appropriate or analogous Ohio limitations period applies to Plaintiffs' claims under these statutes. <i>See </i><i>Wilson,</i> 471 U.S. at 266-67, 105 S.Ct. 1938. The nearest analogous statute for both claims is Ohio Revised Code § 2305.10, which provides a two-year statute of limitations period. <i>See </i><i>LRL Props. v. Portage Metro Housing Auth.,</i> 55 F.3d 1097, 1105 (6th Cir.1995) (§ 1983); <i>Lewis v. LaFayette County Detention Ctr.,</i> No. 99-5538, 2000 WL 556132, at *2 (6th Cir. April 28, 2000) (Rehabilitation Act). Consequently, Plaintiffs had two years from the time their claims accrued in which to file.</p>\n<p>Although the statutes of limitations for both the Rehabilitation Act and § 1983 are borrowed from state law, the actions accrue and the statutory period begins to run according to federal law. <i>See </i><i>Wallace v. Kato,</i> 549 U.S. 384, 388, 127 S.Ct. 1091, 166 L.Ed.2d 973 (2007); <i>Southerland,</i> 41 F.3d at 254. The general federal rule is that \"the statute of limitations begins to run when the reasonable person knows, or in the exercise of due diligence should have known, both his injury and the cause of that injury.\" <i>Campbell v. Grand</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*537</span> <i>Trunk W. R.R. Co.,</i> 238 F.3d 772, 775 (6th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p>Consequently, Plaintiffs' claims accrued on August 31, 2005, when they knew that CB had been expelled from Oakstone because of the Bishops' inquiries into his class assignment. It is irrelevant that Plaintiffs also had an administrative remedy available to them at that point, or that they were required to exhaust that remedy before bringing suit; redress was available at the time of the injury. <i>Cf. </i><i>James,</i> 228 F.3d at 769. Plaintiffs had until August 31, 2007, to file their claims under the Rehabilitation Act or § 1983, and the district court correctly concluded that the claim accrued and the statutory period began running on August 31, 2005.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>II. Statutory Tolling for Minority under Ohio Law</i></h2>\n<p>When the statute of limitations is borrowed from state law, so too are the state's tolling provisions, except when they are \"inconsistent with the federal policy underlying the cause of action under consideration.\" <i>Bd. of Regents v. Tomanio,</i> 446 U.S. 478, 485, 100 S.Ct. 1790, 64 L.Ed.2d 440 (1980). In Ohio, unless otherwise provided, if a person was within the age of minority at the time his claim accrued, he may bring the claim within the statutory period after the disability was removed. <i>See</i> Ohio Rev.Code § 2305.16. If the minor plaintiff's claims are joint and inseparable with the claims of other parties, they too can benefit from his disability and bring their claims within the statutory period after his disability ends. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>CB was a minor when his claim accrued, meaning that Ohio's minority tolling provision applies to his case unless it would be \"inconsistent with the federal policy underlying [his] cause of action\" under § 1983 or the Rehabilitation Act. <i>See </i><i>Bd. of Regents,</i> 446 U.S. at 485, 100 S.Ct. 1790. The Supreme Court's language focuses our inquiry on \"the federal statute at issue,\" <i>Hardin v. Straub,</i> 490 U.S. 536, 539, 109 S.Ct. 1998, 104 L.Ed.2d 582 (1989), in other words, \"the cause of action under consideration.\" <i>Bd. of Regents,</i> 446 U.S. at 485, 100 S.Ct. 1790. The federal statutes at issue are § 1983 and the Rehabilitation Act, and we have not previously decided whether Ohio's minority tolling statute is inconsistent with either of these statutes.</p>\n<p>The chief goals of § 1983 are compensation and deterrence, and its subsidiary goals are uniformity and federalism. <i>Hardin,</i> 490 U.S. at 539, 109 S.Ct. 1998. Applying Ohio's minority tolling statute does not undermine either of these goals. As the Supreme Court explained in <i>Hardin:</i></p>\n<blockquote>A State's decision to toll the statute of limitations during the [plaintiff's] disability does not frustrate § 1983's compensation goal. Rather, it enhances the [plaintiff]'s ability to bring suit and recover damages for injuries. Nor does the State's decision to toll its statute of limitations hinder § 1983's deterrence interest. In the event an official's misconduct is ongoing, the plaintiff will have an interest in enjoining it; thus, the time during which the official will unknowingly violate the Constitution may well be short. The State also may have decided that if the official knows an act is unconstitutional, the risk that he or she might be haled into court indefinitely is more likely to check misbehavior than the knowledge that he or she might escape a challenge to that conduct within a brief period of time.</blockquote>\n<p>490 U.S. at 543, 109 S.Ct. 1998. Thus, \"[t]olling is neither inconsistent with nor required by § 1983's goal of compensating persons whose constitutional rights have been violated.\" <i>Id.</i> at 542, 109 S.Ct. 1998. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*538</span> Furthermore, while we have not dealt specifically with Ohio's minority tolling statute in the § 1983 context, we held, in an unpublished decision, that Michigan's minority tolling statute could apply in a § 1983 case to allow an otherwise time-barred claim to proceed. <i>See Hawkins v. Czarnecki,</i> No. 96-2437, at *3, 1998 U.S.App. Lexis 1690, at *9-10 (6th Cir. Feb. 2, 1998); <i>cf. </i><i>Austin v. Brammer,</i> 555 F.2d 142, 143-44 (6th Cir.1977) (recognizing the applicability of Ohio's statute, which allows tolling for imprisonment, in the § 1983 context).</p>\n<p>We have not previously examined the compatibility of Ohio's tolling statute with the Rehabilitation Act, but we have recognized that it is \"is a `civil rights statute ... closely analogous to section 1983.'\" <i>Hall v. Knott County Bd. of Educ.,</i> 941 F.2d 402, 408 (6th Cir.1991) (quoting <i>Alexopulos v. San Francisco Unified Sch. Dist.,</i> 817 F.2d 551, 554 (9th Cir.1987)). Consistent with that recognition, we have applied the same state-law limitations period to Rehabilitation Act claims as to § 1983 claims. <i>Southerland,</i> 41 F.3d at 254. Thus, Ohio's tolling provisions apply to CB's claims because the minority tolling statute is not inconsistent with § 1983, and the Rehabilitation Act's goal of protecting individuals with handicaps from discrimination, <i>see </i><i>Baker v. Bd. of Regents,</i> 991 F.2d 628, 631-32 (10th Cir.1993), is not undermined by allowing minority tolling. <i>See </i><i>Hickey v. Irving Indep. Sch. Dist.,</i> 976 F.2d 980, 983-84 (5th Cir.1992) (reversing and remanding a district court's decision that a plaintiff's claims were time-barred under the Rehabilitation Act because the court had failed to consider whether Texas's minority tolling statute was applicable).</p>\n<p>The Bishops' claims are also tolled by virtue of CB's minority. According to Ohio's tolling provisions, a third-party's claims are tolled based on the disability of one party when the third-party's claims are \"joint and inseparable\" from the disabled party's claims. <i>See</i> Ohio Rev. Code § 2305.16. Under Ohio law, claims can be \"joint and inseparable\" even though they are \"separate and distinct.\" <i>Fehrenbach v. O'Malley,</i> 164 Ohio App.3d 80, 841 N.E.2d 350, 366 (2005). The Bishops seek monetary losses and loss of consortium, and these claims are derivative of CB's constitutional claims because they arose from his expulsion from Oakstone. <i>See id.</i> (reasoning that parents' claims for loss of consortium and medical expenses were derivative of the minor child's malpractice claim because all three claims \"arose out of the same allegedly tortious act,\" even though the parents' injuries were separate and distinct and the single alleged wrong gave rise to two separate and distinct claims: one on behalf the child for personal injury and one on behalf of the parents for loss of consortium and medical expenses); <i>see also Loudin v. Mills,</i> No. C-990569, at *4-5, 2000 WL 569569, 2000 Ohio App. Lexis 2006, at *12-13 (Ohio Ct.App. May 12, 2000) (recognizing parents' claims for loss of consortium and reimbursement for incurred losses as derivative claims of their son's claims of sexual assault, which were thereby subject to the same statute of limitations and minority tolling as their son's claim, and characterizing their claims for negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress as separate claims that were nevertheless tolled during the minority of their son). Since we conclude that both CB's and the Bishops' federal law claims were subject to minority tolling and therefore not barred by the statute of limitations, we reverse and remand the district court's decision as to these claims.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>III. State Law Claims</i></h2>\n<p>When all the federal claims in a case have been dismissed, there is a strong <span class=\"star-pagination\">*539</span> presumption in favor of dismissing any remaining state law claims unless the plaintiff can establish an alternate basis for federal jurisdiction. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. § 1367; <i>United Mine Workers v. Gibbs,</i> 383 U.S. 715, 726, 86 S.Ct. 1130, 16 L.Ed.2d 218 (1966). Consequently, the district court did not err in dismissing Plaintiffs' state law claims upon its dismissal of the federal claims in this case. Nevertheless, because we reverse the district court's decision on Plaintiffs' federal claims, we also reverse the district court's decision on their state law claims. Since the district court will once again have federal claims before it, we remand the state law claims to the district court to allow it to determine whether to exercise supplemental jurisdiction in light of this change in circumstances.</p>\n<p>REVERSED AND REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  The Honorable Danny C. Reeves, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Kentucky, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  Throughout this opinion \"the Bishops\" will refer to Courtland and Michelle Bishop, \"CB\" will refer to their minor son, and \"Plaintiffs\" will refer to the Bishops and CB collectively.</p>\n<p>[2]  Plaintiffs do not raise the question of disability tolling, and we are not deciding the applicability of that rule. <i>See</i> Ohio Rev.Code § 2305.16.</p>\n\n</div>",

In Ohio, unless otherwise provided, if a person was within the age of minority at the time his claim accrued, he may bring the claim within the statutory period after the disability was removed. <i>See</i> Ohio Rev.Code § 2305.16. If the minor plaintiff's claims are joint and inseparable with the claims of other parties, they too can benefit from his disability and bring their claims within the statutory period after his disability ends. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>CB was a minor when his claim accrued, meaning that Ohio's minority tolling provision applies to his case unless it would be \"inconsistent with the federal policy underlying [his] cause of action\" under § 1983 or the Rehabilitation Act. <i>See </i><i>Bd. of Regents,</i> 446 U.S. at 485, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110261\"><a href=\"/opinion/110261/board-of-regents-of-univ-of-state-of-ny-v-tomanio/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The federal statutes at issue are § 1983 and the Rehabilitation Act, and we have not previously decided whether Ohio's minority tolling statute is inconsistent with either of these statutes.</p>\n<p>The chief goals of § 1983 are compensation and deterrence, and its subsidiary goals are uniformity and federalism. <i>Hardin,</i> 490 U.S. at 539, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112265\"><a href=\"/opinion/112265/hardin-v-straub/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1998</span></a></span>. Applying Ohio's minority tolling statute does not undermine either of these goals. As the Supreme Court explained in <i>Hardin:</i></p>\n<blockquote>A State's decision to toll the statute of limitations during the [plaintiff's] disability does not frustrate § 1983's compensation goal. Rather, it enhances the [plaintiff]'s ability to bring suit and recover damages for injuries. Nor does the State's decision to toll its statute of limitations hinder § 1983's deterrence interest. In the event an official's misconduct is ongoing, the plaintiff will have an interest in enjoining it; thus, the time during which the official will unknowingly violate the Constitution may well be short. The State also may have decided that if the official knows an act is unconstitutional, the risk that he or she might be haled into court indefinitely is more likely to check misbehavior than the knowledge that he or she might escape a challenge to that conduct within a brief period of time.</blockquote>\n<p>490 U.S. at 543, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112265\"><a href=\"/opinion/112265/hardin-v-straub/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Czarnecki,</i> No. 96-2437, at *3, 1998 U.S.App. Lexis 1690, at *9-10 (6th Cir. Feb. 2, 1998); <i>cf. </i><i>Austin v.

Knott County Bd. of Educ.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"566351\"><a href=\"/opinion/566351/shirlene-hall-v-knott-county-board-of-education/\"><span class=\"volume\">941</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">402</span></a></span>, 408 (6th Cir.1991) (quoting <i>Alexopulos v.

Consistent with that recognition, we have applied the same state-law limitations period to Rehabilitation Act claims as to § 1983 claims. <i>Southerland,</i> 41 F.3d at 254. Thus, Ohio's tolling provisions apply to CB's claims because the minority tolling statute is not inconsistent with § 1983, and the Rehabilitation Act's goal of protecting individuals with handicaps from discrimination, <i>see </i><i>Baker v. Bd. of Regents,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"604925\"><a href=\"/opinion/604925/marvin-d-baker-v-the-board-of-regents-of-the-state-of-kansas-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">991</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">628</span></a></span>, 631-32 (10th Cir.1993), is not undermined by allowing minority tolling. <i>See </i><i>Hickey v. Irving Indep. Sch. Dist.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"592109\"><a href=\"/opinion/592109/laura-hickey-v-irving-independent-school-district/\"><span class=\"volume\">976</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">980</span></a></span>, 983-84 (5th Cir.1992) (reversing and remanding a district court's decision that a plaintiff's claims were time-barred under the Rehabilitation Act because the court had failed to consider whether Texas's minority tolling statute was applicable).</p>\n<p>The Bishops' claims are also tolled by virtue of CB's minority. According to Ohio's tolling provisions, a third-party's claims are tolled based on the disability of one party when the third-party's claims are \"joint and inseparable\" from the disabled party's claims. <i>See</i> Ohio Rev. Code § 2305.16. Under Ohio law, claims can be \"joint and inseparable\" even though they are \"separate and distinct.\" <i>Fehrenbach v. O'Malley,</i> 164 Ohio App.3d 80, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">841</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">350</span></span>, 366 (2005). The Bishops seek monetary losses and loss of consortium, and these claims are derivative of CB's constitutional claims because they arose from his expulsion from Oakstone. <i>See id.</i> (reasoning that parents' claims for loss of consortium and medical expenses were derivative of the minor child's malpractice claim because all three claims \"arose out of the same allegedly tortious act,\" even though the parents' injuries were separate and distinct and the single alleged wrong gave rise to two separate and distinct claims: one on behalf the child for personal injury and one on behalf of the parents for loss of consortium and medical expenses); <i>see also Loudin v. Mills,</i> No. C-990569, at *4-5, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2000</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">569569</span></span>, 2000 Ohio App. Lexis 2006, at *12-13 (Ohio Ct.App. May 12, 2000) (recognizing parents' claims for loss of consortium and reimbursement for incurred losses as derivative claims of their son's claims of sexual assault, which were thereby subject to the same statute of limitations and minority tolling as their son's claim, and characterizing their claims for negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress as separate claims that were nevertheless tolled during the minority of their son). Since we conclude that both CB's and the Bishops' federal law claims were subject to minority tolling and therefore not barred by the statute of limitations, we reverse and remand the district court's decision as to these claims.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>III. State Law Claims</i></h2>\n<p>When all the federal claims in a case have been dismissed, there is a strong <span class=\"star-pagination\">*539</span> presumption in favor of dismissing any remaining state law claims unless the plaintiff can establish an alternate basis for federal jurisdiction. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. § 1367; <i>United Mine Workers v. Gibbs,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107200\"><a href=\"/opinion/107200/mine-workers-v-gibbs/\"><span class=\"volume\">383</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">715</span></a></span>, 726, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107200\"><a href=\"/opinion/107200/mine-workers-v-gibbs/\"><span class=\"volume\">86</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1130</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107200\"><a href=\"/opinion/107200/mine-workers-v-gibbs/\"><span class=\"volume\">16</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">218</span></a></span> (1966). Consequently, the district court did not err in dismissing Plaintiffs' state law claims upon its dismissal of the federal claims in this case. Nevertheless, because we reverse the district court's decision on Plaintiffs' federal claims, we also reverse the district court's decision on their state law claims. Since the district court will once again have federal claims before it, we remand the state law claims to the district court to allow it to determine whether to exercise supplemental jurisdiction in light of this change in circumstances.</p>\n<p>REVERSED AND REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  The Honorable Danny C. Reeves, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Kentucky, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  Throughout this opinion \"the Bishops\" will refer to Courtland and Michelle Bishop, \"CB\" will refer to their minor son, and \"Plaintiffs\" will refer to the Bishops and CB collectively.</p>\n<p>[2]  Plaintiffs do not raise the question of disability tolling, and we are not deciding the applicability of that rule. <i>See</i> Ohio Rev.Code § 2305.16.</p>\n\n</div>",
