Appellant Darrell Spencer\n(“Spencer” or “Appellant”) appeals from the modification of his crack cocaine sentence\npursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c) by the district court in the Eastern District of Michigan\non January 23, 2009. For the following reasons, we AFFIRM the decision of the district\ncourt.\n\n\n         *\n          The Honorable Solomon Oliver, Jr., Chief United States District Judge for the Northern District\nof Ohio, sitting by designation.\n\n\n                                                   1\n\fNo. 09-1114        United States v. Spencer                                        Page 2\n\n\n                  I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n       On June 25, 1993, Appellant was convicted by a jury for possession with intent\nto distribute cocaine base, possession with intent to distribute cocaine base within 1,000\nfeet of a public school, and use of a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking\ncrime. His adjusted offense level was 38, and he had a criminal history category of II,\nwhich resulted in a guideline sentencing range of 262 to 327 months on the crack\ncocaine charges and a consecutive 60-month sentence on the firearm charge. On\nSeptember 14, 1993, the district court sentenced Appellant to 262 months on each crack\ncocaine count, to run concurrently with each other, and a consecutive 60-month term on\nthe firearm charge.\n\n       The Sentencing Guidelines were amended in 2007 to lower the base offense\nlevels for crack cocaine. This amendment was made retroactive the following year.\nUnder 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2), a district court has the authority to reduce a previously-\nimposed sentence based on the amended guidelines. However, a court cannot, except\nin limited instances, reduce a sentence to less than the bottom of the amended guideline\nrange. 18 U.S.C. § 1B1.10(b)(2)(A). Appellant filed a motion to have his sentence\nmodified under the retroactive guidelines on January 23, 2008, and that motion was\nsupplemented by his appointed counsel on September 24, 2008. On January 23, 2009,\nthe district court granted Appellant’s motion and reduced his sentence to 210 months on\nthe crack cocaine counts, which was the bottom of the new guideline range. At the\nsentence modification proceeding, the district court stated that, pursuant to 18 U.S.C.\n§ 1B1.10(b)(2)(A), it could not reduce Appellant’s sentence below the amended\nguideline range, but would have done so if permitted under the statute.\n\n                           II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n       The court reviews a district court’s interpretation of a statute at sentencing de\nnovo. United States v. Robinson, 609 F.3d 868 (6th Cir. 2010); United States v.\nWashington, 584 F.3d 693, 695 (6th Cir. 2009).\n\fNo. 09-1114        United States v. Spencer                                         Page 3\n\n\n                             III. LAW AND ANALYSIS\n\n       Appellant argues that the district court had the authority to sentence him to a non-\nguideline sentence when his sentence was reduced pursuant to § 3582(c)(2). He\nmaintains that a sentence modification is essentially a resentencing, and therefore United\nStates v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220, which made the Sentencing Guidelines advisory, is\napplicable in these proceedings. Appellee, on the other hand, argues that a sentence\nmodification proceeding is limited in scope and that Booker does not apply.\n\n       The Supreme Court has recently rendered a decision on this issue. In Dillon v.\nUnited States, 130 S. Ct. 2683, 2691-92 (2010), the Supreme Court stated that\n§ 3582(c)(2) provides for a limited procedure for the modification of sentences and that,\nunder such circumstances, defendants are not actually being sentenced or resentenced.\nThe Court determined that “[s]ection 3582(c)(2)’s text, together with its narrow scope,\nshows that Congress intended to authorize only a limited adjustment to an otherwise\nfinal sentence and not a plenary resentencing proceeding.” Id. at 2691. Therefore,\nBooker does not apply to these proceedings. Id. at 2692. More specifically, courts\ncannot modify a sentence below the amended guideline range under 18 U.S.C.\n§ 3582(c)(2), unless the sentencing court originally sentenced the defendant below the\nguideline range. Id. at 2691-92. In such cases, a court could modify a sentence\n“comparably” below the new guideline range. Id. at 2692.\n\n       Relying on Dillon and Washington, the latter being a Sixth Circuit case decided\nprior to Dillon, this court recently held in Robinson “‘that pursuant to 18 U.S.C.\n§ 3582(c)(2), a district court is not authorized to reduce a defendant’s sentence below\nthe amended Guidelines range.’” Robinson, 609 F.3d at 869 (quoting Washington, 584\nF.3d at 701). Robinson is analogous to the instant case. The defendant in Robinson also\nwas sentenced for crack cocaine offenses and a firearms charge, and he moved for a\nreduced sentence when the Sentencing Guidelines were amended. Id. at 868-69. The\ndefendant appealed the district court’s finding that it could not reduce his sentence below\nthe modified Guidelines range, and the Sixth Circuit affirmed the district court’s finding.\nId. at 869. Thus, Appellant’s analogous claim is without merit.\n\fNo. 09-1114      United States v. Spencer                                   Page 4\n\n\n                              IV. CONCLUSION\n\n      For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the decision of the district court.\n\f",
