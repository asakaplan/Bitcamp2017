This is a public nuisance action brought against\nDeutsche Bank Trust Company and affiliated companies (“Deutsche Bank”), in relation\nto twenty-five vacant properties in and around Cleveland owned by Deutsche Bank.\nPlaintiff Cleveland Housing Renewal Project, Inc. (“CHRP”), filed the action in the\nCleveland Municipal Housing Court seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. Deutsche\nBank removed the action to federal court based on the parties’ diversity of citizenship.\nHowever, the district court granted CHRP’s motion to remand. The court concluded that\nsubject matter jurisdiction was established by virtue of the parties’ diversity of\ncitizenship and that CHRP had standing to proceed in federal court. The court\nnonetheless remanded the action to state court based on Burford abstention, to avoid\nfederal disruption of a coherent state policy regarding a matter of substantial public\nconcern. Deutsche Bank timely appealed. Finding that abstention is not warranted, we\nvacate the abstention order and remand the case to the district court for further\nproceedings on CHRP’s complaint.\n\n                                 I. BACKGROUND\n\n       Plaintiff CHRP is a private non-profit corporation whose principal goal is the\nimprovement and renewal of housing and economic conditions in the City of Cleveland.\nWe accept that the four affiliated Deutsche Bank entities named as defendants comprise\na national banking association incorporated under the laws of the United States and\ninclude a New York state chartered trust company.\n\n       CHRP filed its complaint on December 15, 2008, in the Cleveland Municipal\nHousing Court, (1) seeking a declaration that each of twenty-five named residential\nproperties allegedly owned by Deutsche Bank constitutes a “public nuisance” as defined\nby Ohio law, being a menace to the public health, welfare, or safety; and (2) seeking\ninjunctive relief requiring Deutsche Bank to abate the alleged nuisances. The complaint\n\fNos. 09-3571/3648           Cleveland Housing Renewal Project v.                   Page 3\n                            Deutsche Bank Trust Co., et al.\n\n\nalso alleges that Deutsche Bank’s “business practices” relating to the maintenance and\nsale of properties subject to foreclosure amount to common-law nuisances, in that homes\nare sold at extremely distressed prices, purchased by speculators, “flipped,” and\nultimately abandoned, to the detriment of property values and neighborhood quality.\nCHRP alleges that Deutsche Bank’s practices place homes in a “post foreclosure death\nspiral: vacancy 6 boarded windows and doors 6 break-ins and vandalism 6 theft of the\nhome’s assets (copper, aluminum, iron) 6 haven for criminal activity 6 decrease in\nneighboring housing values.” R. 1, Complaint ¶ 5. CHRP also seeks an injunction\nprohibiting these practices.\n\n       In addition to Deutsche Bank, CHRP named the City of Cleveland as a\ndefendant. The complaint does not allege any cause of action against the City, nor does\nit seek any relief from the City. The complaint identifies the City as an entity that “may\nhave or claim to have some interest in real property that is the subject of this action by\nvirtue of code violations, utility assessments and Nuisance abatement costs.” R. 1,\nComplaint ¶ 8. In answering the complaint, the City asserted cross-claims against\nDeutsche Bank. Deutsche Bank removed this action to federal court on the basis of\ndiversity of citizenship.\n\n       CHRP filed a motion to remand, contending primarily that the district court\nlacked jurisdiction because (i) CHRP lacked Article III and prudential standing; (ii) the\nCity was a non-diverse defendant; and (iii) the jurisdictional amount-in-controversy\nrequirement had not been satisfied. Alternatively, CHRP argued that the district court\nshould abstain from exercising jurisdiction under Burford v. Sun Oil Co., 319 U.S. 315\n(1943). Deutsche Bank opposed remand and moved the district court to realign the City\nas a plaintiff. The district court granted Deutsche Bank’s motion for realignment and\nruled that it had jurisdiction over CHRP’s claims, but declined to exercise jurisdiction\nunder Burford. See Cleveland Housing Renewal Project v. Deutsche Bank Trust Co.,\n606 F. Supp. 2d 698 (N.D. Ohio 2009).\n\fNos. 09-3571/3648          Cleveland Housing Renewal Project v.                    Page 4\n                           Deutsche Bank Trust Co., et al.\n\n\n       Deutsche Bank filed a motion to reconsider and presented the district court with\n“newly discovered evidence” concerning the Cleveland Housing Court Judge’s alleged\nbias in this case. The court dismissed the notion of any bias in the housing court, noting\nthat Ohio law provides for disqualification of judges and appellate review of housing\ncourt decisions and denied the motion to reconsider. Cleveland Housing Renewal\nProject v. Deutsche Bank Trust Co., 2009 WL 1034236 (N.D. Ohio, April 16, 2009).\nDeutsche Bank timely filed notice of appeal.\n\n                                    II. ANALYSIS\n\n       A. Appellate Jurisdiction\n\n       We have jurisdiction to decide this appeal. In Quackenbush v. Allstate Ins. Co.,\n517 U.S. 706, 711-12 (1996), the Supreme Court held that 28 U.S.C. § 1447(d), which\nbars appellate review of remand orders in some instances, must be read in pari materia\nwith 28 U.S.C. § 1447(c), “so that only remands based on grounds specified in § 1447(c)\nare immune from review under § 1447(d).” Id. (quoting Things Remembered, Inc. v.\nPetrarca, 516 U.S. 124, 127 (1995)). In Quackenbush, the Court held that an abstention-\nbased remand order does not come within a category of remand orders that are immune\nfrom review. Id. at 712. In other words, per Quackenbush, an abstention-based remand\norder is subject to appellate review.\n\n       CHRP argues that Congress’s 1996 amendment of § 1447(c) to include reference\nto “[a] motion to remand the case on the basis of any defect other than lack of subject\nmatter jurisdiction” changes the meaning of § 1447(c) and renders abstention-based\nremands also immune from appellate review. Yet, in an opinion issued last year, the\nSupreme Court declined to read the amendment as working a material change. Carlsbad\nTechnology, Inc. v. HIF Bio, Inc., — U.S. —, 129 S.Ct. 1862 (2009). Specifically, the\nCourt recognized that remand orders based on a lack of subject matter jurisdiction are\nnot reviewable, but held that a discretionary decision not to exercise jurisdiction is not\na remand for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Id. at 1866-67. In so ruling, the Court\ncited with approval Quackenbush’s holding that an abstention-based remand is not for\n\fNos. 09-3571/3648          Cleveland Housing Renewal Project v.                     Page 5\n                           Deutsche Bank Trust Co., et al.\n\n\nlack of subject matter jurisdiction. Id. at 1866. The Court refrained from revisiting the\npremises of the Quackenbush ruling, id. at 1866 n.*, despite expressed unease over the\nextent to which the Court’s applications of § 1447(d) appear to be at odds with the\nprovision’s plain language, see id at 1868-69 (Scalia, J., concurring, and Souter, J.,\nconcurring).\n\n       We follow the Supreme Court’s lead. Accordingly, CHRP’s objection to\nappellate jurisdiction is overruled.\n\n       B. Subject Matter Jurisdiction\n\n       As a second threshold matter, CHRP argues that irrespective of the merits of\nBurford abstention, the district court’s order of remand should be affirmed because the\ndistrict court lacked subject matter jurisdiction in the first place. CHRP contends the\nparties are not completely diverse and the amount-in-controversy is less than $75,000.\nSee 28 U.S.C. § 1332. This Court reviews a district court’s decision regarding subject\nmatter jurisdiction de novo. Loren v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Mich., 505 F.3d 598,\n604 (6th Cir. 2007). The party invoking federal court jurisdiction—in this case,\nDeutsche Bank, as removing party—has the burden of demonstrating by competent proof\nthat the complete-diversity and amount-in-controversy requirements are met. Hertz\nCorp. v. Friend, — U.S. —, 130 S.Ct. 1181, 1194-95 (2010).\n\n       1. Diversity of Citizenship\n\n       CHRP named the City of Cleveland (“the City”) as a defendant. Because both\nCHRP and the City are citizens of Ohio, CHRP argued below that complete diversity of\ncitizenship was lacking and that the district court did not have subject matter\njurisdiction. CHRP insisted that the City was a properly joined party, who was not a\nnominal or formal party, and whose presence was required to avoid the problem of a\npotential buyer taking the property subject to the City’s super-priority lien for\nunrecorded assessments. The district court, however, granted Deutsche Bank’s motion\nto realign the City as a plaintiff, which created complete diversity between all plaintiffs\n\fNos. 09-3571/3648          Cleveland Housing Renewal Project v.                      Page 6\n                           Deutsche Bank Trust Co., et al.\n\n\nand all defendants. Cleveland Housing, 606 F. Supp. 2d at 709-10. The district court\nfound that CHRP’s concerns regarding liens the City might hold on the properties to be\nancillary or secondary to the ultimate purpose of the lawsuit, i.e., to abate the conditions\ncreating the nuisance. Id. In relation to the primary dispute in controversy, the district\ncourt concluded that the City’s interests are aligned with those of CHRP.\n\n        The district court properly recognized that it is the court’s responsibility to\nensure that the parties are properly aligned according to their interests in the litigation.\nSee United States Fidelity and Guar. Co. v. Thomas Solvent Co., 955 F.2d 1085, 1089\n(6th Cir. 1992) (citing City of Indianapolis v. Chase Nat’l Bank of City of New York, 314\nU.S. 63, 69 (1941)). Parties must “be aligned in accordance with the primary dispute in\nthe controversy, even where a different, legitimate dispute between the parties supports\nthe original alignment.” Id. The primary controversy in this case clearly stems from\nCHRP’s demand that Deutsche Bank abate alleged nuisances relating to its properties\nand be enjoined from creating and maintaining similar nuisances in the future. The\npurpose of the action is to remedy “the condition of the vacant, abandoned and\nforeclosed properties located within the Cleveland neighborhoods [CHRP] serves.” R.\n5-2, Mot. to Remand at 1. The City’s interests are not adverse to this purpose. In fact,\nto the extent that CHRP may be successful, the City will also benefit. The conclusion\nthat CHRP’s and the City’s interests are aligned, not adverse, in relation to the primary\npurpose of the litigation is corroborated by the fact that the City filed a cross-claim to\nrecover the costs of abating nuisances at several of the properties at issue. Should CHRP\nultimately prevail and obtain injunctive relief, Deutsche Bank will be enjoined from\nengaging in similar conduct with respect to similar properties in the Cleveland area,\npotentially sparing the City the costs of future nuisance abatement.\n\n        CHRP does not directly challenge this characterization of the primary\ncontroversy between the parties, but argues that the parties’ common interests in abating\nthe complained of nuisance conditions are insufficient reason to re-align the parties.\nYet, the potentially adverse interests represented by the City’s liens on some of the\nproperties are clearly “ancillary” or “secondary” to the primary controversy. To find\n\fNos. 09-3571/3648           Cleveland Housing Renewal Project v.                      Page 7\n                            Deutsche Bank Trust Co., et al.\n\n\nerror in the district court’s realignment of the parties, we would have to disregard the\nteaching of Thomas Solvent and Indianapolis v. Chase Nat’l Bank. This we are\nunwilling to do. Accordingly, we hold that the district court properly realigned the City\nas a plaintiff and properly held there is complete diversity between the parties for\npurposes of subject matter jurisdiction.\n\n        2. Amount in Controversy\n\n        CHRP also challenges the district court’s finding that the amount-in-controversy\nrequirement for diversity jurisdiction is met. “In actions seeking declaratory or injunctive\nrelief, it is well established that the amount in controversy is measured by the value of\nthe object of the litigation.” Hunt v. Wash. State Apple Adver. Comm’n, 432 U.S. 333,\n347 (1977). Additionally, we have observed that the “costs of complying with an\ninjunction . . . may establish the amount-in-controversy.” Everett v. Verizon Wireless,\nInc., 460 F.3d 818, 829 (6th Cir. 2006). Deutsche Bank has the burden of showing that\nthe requirement “more likely than not” is satisfied. Everett, 460 F.3d at 822.\n\n        The district court was persuaded by Deutsche Bank’s showing that injunctive\nrelief requiring it to abate the alleged nuisances or demolish the twenty-five residential\nproperties and requiring it to alter its business practices would result in costs to Deutsche\nBank in excess of $75,000. Cleveland Housing, 606 F. Supp. 2d at 711. Again, CHRP\ndoes not directly challenge the district court’s finding, but argues that the amount in\ncontroversy should be determined from its viewpoint, rather than Deutsche Bank’s.\nCHRP does not explain what the value of injunctive relief would be or how the value of\nsuch relief should be assessed, but asserts simply that the value of the relief is less than\n$75,000.\n\n        While the value of the requested injunctive relief to CHRP may be difficult to\nquantify, the notion that abatement of nuisances on twenty-five parcels of abandoned\nproperty would amount to improvement valued at less than $75,000 is patently suspect.\nCHRP seeks to have twenty-five properties declared public nuisances and require the\ndefendants to abate each nuisance, which may include, according to the complaint,\n\fNos. 09-3571/3648          Cleveland Housing Renewal Project v.                      Page 8\n                           Deutsche Bank Trust Co., et al.\n\n\nreplacement of the home’s assets, such as copper or aluminum, repairing or replacing\ndoors and windows, and repairing vandalism damage. As an alternative to abating the\ntwenty-five properties at issue in this litigation, CHRP seeks to have the properties\ndemolished.\n\n       Deutsche Bank has satisfactorily shown that it is “more likely than not” that the\namount-in-controversy requirement is met. The district court recognized that the\nCuyahoga County Auditor’s valuation of the twenty-five properties at a total of more\nthan $1.3 million is likely inflated, but correctly concluded that potential demolition of\neven just several properties would likely result in costs exceeding $75,000. Id. Indeed,\ncommon sense dictates that the significant remedial measures or complete destruction\nof the properties CHRP seeks would certainly cost, on average, in excess of $3,000 per\nstructure.   In its rather perfunctory challenge to the district court’s amount-in-\ncontroversy determination, CHRP has failed to show error.\n\n       Accordingly, we hold that the district court properly satisfied itself of its subject\nmatter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1332.\n\n       C. Article III Standing\n\n        Even if subject matter jurisdiction is established, CHRP maintains that remand\nto state court is warranted on the ground that it lacks standing to proceed with its claims\nin federal court. The district court overruled the objection, holding that CHRP does have\nstanding. The district court correctly identified and applied the three constitutional\nstanding requirements: (1) injury in fact, (2) traceable to the defendant’s challenged\nactions, (3) which is redressable by a favorable decision. Cleveland Housing, 606 F.\nSupp. 2d at 705 (citing Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs. (TOC), Inc.,\n528 U.S. 167, 181-82 (2000), and Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-61\n(1992)). The district court concluded that CHRP had adequately alleged cognizable\ninjury to its organizational efforts to renew and improve blighted Cleveland\nneighborhoods. Id. at 705-08 (citing Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman, 455 U.S. 363,\n379 (1982)). The district court was also satisfied that CHRP’s complaint contained\n\fNos. 09-3571/3648            Cleveland Housing Renewal Project v.                      Page 9\n                             Deutsche Bank Trust Co., et al.\n\n\nadequate allegations that the injury was traceable to Deutsche Bank’s practices and that\nthe injury was redressable through injunctive relief.\n\n          Further, the district court recognized that there are also “several judicially self-\nimposed limitations on the exercise of federal jurisdiction, such as the general\nprohibition on a litigant's raising another person's legal rights, the rule barring\nadjudication of generalized grievances more appropriately addressed in the\nrepresentative branches, and the requirement that a plaintiff's complaint fall within the\nzone of interests protected by the law invoked.” Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 751\n(1984).     The court held that CHRP’s complaint meets all of these prudential\nrequirements. Cleveland Housing, 606 F. Supp. 2d at 708-09.\n\n          On appeal, CHRP has not mounted a serious challenge to the district court’s\nanalysis of the constitutional or prudential standing requirements. Indeed, we find no\nerror in the district court’s holding that CHRP has standing to prosecute this action in\nfederal court.\n\n          D. Burford Abstention\n\n          The district court remanded the case to state court based on Burford abstention.\nThe Supreme Court ruled in Burford v. Sun Oil Co., 319 U.S. 315 (1943), that federal\ncourts “should exercise their discretionary power with proper regard for the rightful\nindependence of state governments in carrying out their domestic policy.” Id. at 318.\nThe district court’s decision to abstain is reviewed de novo. See Saginaw Housing\nCom'n v. Bannum, Inc., 576 F.3d 620, 625 (6th Cir. 2009).\n\n          There are two leading Supreme Court rulings on Burford abstention,\nQuackenbush v. Allstate Ins. Co., 517 U.S. 706 (1996), and New Orleans Public Service,\nInc. v. Council of City of New Orleans, 491 U.S. 350 (1989) (“NOPSI”).                     In\nQuackenbush, the Court observed that Burford abstention is a matter of equitable\ndiscretion reflecting principles of federalism and comity and requiring the balancing of\n\fNos. 09-3571/3648          Cleveland Housing Renewal Project v.                    Page 10\n                           Deutsche Bank Trust Co., et al.\n\n\nfederal interests in retaining jurisdiction against the competing concern for the\nindependence of state action:\n\n        The equitable decision balances the strong federal interest in having\n        certain classes of cases, and certain federal rights, adjudicated in federal\n        court, against the State's interests in maintaining uniformity in the\n        treatment of an essentially local problem, and retaining local control over\n        difficult questions of state law bearing on policy problems of substantial\n        public import. This balance only rarely favors abstention, and the power\n        to dismiss recognized in Burford represents an extraordinary and narrow\n        exception to the duty of the District Court to adjudicate a controversy\n        properly before it.\n\nQuackenbush, 517 U.S. at 728 (citations and quotation marks omitted; emphasis added).\nThe Quackenbush Court noted that its overruling of abstention in NOPSI represented a\nrecent application of these principles in relation to a claim of federal preemption of state\nadministrative proceedings, illustrating the narrow range of circumstances in which\nBurford abstention may be justified. Id. at 726. The Court characterized the NOPSI\nruling as follows:\n\n        We thus indicated that Burford allows a federal court to dismiss a case\n        only if it presents “‘difficult questions of state law bearing on policy\n        problems of substantial public import whose importance transcends the\n        result in the case then at bar,’” or if its adjudication in a federal forum\n        “‘would be disruptive of state efforts to establish a coherent policy with\n        respect to a matter of substantial public concern.’”\n\nId. at 726-27 (quoting NOPSI, 491 U.S. at 361).\n\n        In NOPSI, the state interests were evidenced by a state administrative regulatory\nscheme, but such a statewide regulatory scheme is not necessarily prerequisite to\nBurford abstention. Saginaw Housing, 576 F.3d at 627. Because Burford abstention is\nconcerned with potential disruption of a state regulatory scheme, “[t]he key question is\nwhether an erroneous federal court decision could impair the state’s effort to implement\nits policy.” Id. at 626 (quoting Ada-Cascade Watch Co., Inc. v. Cascade Res. Recovery,\nInc., 720 F.3d 897, 903 (6th Cir. 1983)).\n\fNos. 09-3571/3648          Cleveland Housing Renewal Project v.                    Page 11\n                           Deutsche Bank Trust Co., et al.\n\n\n        1. Federal Interests\n\n        First, we examine the federal interests. The instant action, removed based on the\nparties’ diversity, falls within one of those “classes of cases” to which a “strong federal\ninterest” attaches. Quackenbush, 517 U.S. at 728. Unlike Quackenbush, which involved\nthe Federal Arbitration Act, and NOPSI, which presented a question of federal\npreemption, no federal statute or federal right is implicated in this case. CHRP’s\ncomplaint is premised exclusively on Ohio state law. There is, however, a strong federal\ninterest in adjudicating cases brought under the congressional grant of diversity\njurisdiction:\n\n        By conferring jurisdiction on the federal courts in diversity cases through\n        28 U.S.C. § 1332, Congress intended a uniformly administered federal\n        judicial system, which affords litigants of diverse citizenship convenient\n        forums in which to vindicate their rights. Although the basic\n        Congressional purpose behind the grant of diversity jurisdiction was to\n        protect out-of-state suitors from the prejudice of state courts, . . . . the\n        Congressional purpose was broader. By vesting the federal district\n        courts with equity jurisdiction and guaranteeing adequate appeals within\n        the federal judicial system, Congress afforded procedures and remedies\n        that were not available in the courts of several states.\n\nMiller v. Davis, 507 F.2d 308, 316-317 (6th Cir. 1974) (footnote, citations omitted).\n\n        The district court was cognizant of the federal interest in diversity jurisdiction,\nbut noted that such interest was “particularly strong” in Miller because that case\ninvolved a large nationwide pension fund. The district court determined that the federal\ninterest in affording a federal forum for CHRP’s complaint is not as strong because no\nsuch national concern is presented in this case. Cleveland Housing, 606 F. Supp. 2d at\n713.\n\n        Deutsche Bank insists there are federal interests in this case beyond the virtues\nof diversity jurisdiction, noting that Congress has recently appropriated $2 billion for the\nredevelopment of real estate markets in distress due to foreclosures. Deutsche Bank also\npoints to various governmental organizations and programs designed to address the\n\fNos. 09-3571/3648          Cleveland Housing Renewal Project v.                    Page 12\n                           Deutsche Bank Trust Co., et al.\n\n\nproblem of home foreclosures throughout the country as evidence that this case touches\non matters of nationwide import. Indeed, we can take judicial notice of the fact that\nresidential foreclosures represent a nationwide epidemic that has precipitated various\ngovernmental remedial measures. Yet, this carries little weight in measuring the federal\ninterests in adjudicating the claims asserted in CHRP’s complaint. This action is not\naddressed to the problems associated with residential foreclosures generally; it is aimed\nat abating nuisances allegedly caused by Deutsche Bank at twenty-five identified\nlocations in the Cleveland area. The fact that government funds have been appropriated\nto address the nation’s foreclosure crisis does not affect the application of Ohio public\nnuisance law in relation to the twenty-five properties in Cleveland.\n\n        Nor are we impressed by Deutsche Bank’s argument that CHRP’s “broadside\nattack” on Deutsche Bank’s “business practices” could result in imposition of local\nrestrictions on the national operations of federally regulated businesses. The argument\nhints at the notion of federal preemption, but is based only on potential conflicts too\nspeculative to materially enhance the federal interests weighing against Burford\nabstention.\n\n        Yet, though unpersuaded by Deutsche Bank’s arguments that there are federal\ninterests beyond the virtues of diversity jurisdiction, we believe the district court\nimproperly undervalued the strength of the federal interest in affording a neutral forum\nfor the adjudication of disputes between parties of diverse citizenship. The district court\ncharacterized the federal interest based on diversity jurisdiction sans other federal rights\nas being “at its nadir.” Cleveland Housing, 606 F. Supp. 2d at 714. The court’s implicit\nconclusion that diversity jurisdiction represents a “strong” federal interest only if\naccompanied by other federal interests is based on a faulty negative inference. In Miller\nv. Davis, as the district court observed, there were, in addition to diversity jurisdiction,\nother federal interests that helped render abstention inappropriate. Yet this does not\ncompel the conclusion that abstention is appropriate if diversity jurisdiction represents\nthe only strong federal interest. Additional federal interests make an already strong\n\fNos. 09-3571/3648            Cleveland Housing Renewal Project v.                  Page 13\n                             Deutsche Bank Trust Co., et al.\n\n\nfederal interest stronger, but their absence does not render an already strong federal\ninterest weak.\n\n        In our opinion, the importance of diversity jurisdiction is particularly strong in\nthis case, where the state law claims (a) are of intense local concern, (b) are asserted\nagainst not just citizens of different states, but affiliates of manifestly “foreign” (i.e.,\nGerman) corporations, and (c) would otherwise be adjudicated by a locally-elected\nmunicipal judge. The district court’s minimization of the “strong federal interest” in\naffording Deutsche Bank a neutral forum for the adjudication of CHRP’s state law\nclaims is a flaw that materially affected its interest-balancing analysis.\n\n        2. State Interests\n\n        The state interests that may be deemed to outweigh the federal interests must\nstem from the need to maintain uniformity in the treatment of an essentially local\nproblem, and the need to retain local control over difficult questions of state law bearing\non policy problems of substantial public import. Quackenbush, 517 U.S. at 728. The\ndistrict court noted that the Ohio legislature had expressed a strong interest in the\nCleveland housing market by (1) establishing a specialized housing division in the\nCleveland Municipal Court with exclusive jurisdiction over statutory public nuisance\nclaims; and (2) authorizing Cuyahoga County (the county surrounding Cleveland) to\ncreate a land reutilization corporation for the purpose of promoting reclamation and\ndevelopment and managing of vacant real property. Cleveland Housing, 606 F. Supp.\n2d at 714-15. Further, with reference to the first NOPSI factor, the district court held\nthat CHRP’s common-law public nuisance claim, attacking Deutsche Bank’s “business\npractices,” presents a difficult question of state law bearing on policy problems of\nsubstantial public import. Id. at 715. As to the second factor, the district court held that\nfederal adjudication of CHRP’s statutory public nuisance claim could disrupt state\nefforts to establish a coherent policy through uniform adjudication of such claims in the\nspecialized housing division of the municipal court. Id. at 715-16.\n\fNos. 09-3571/3648          Cleveland Housing Renewal Project v.                   Page 14\n                           Deutsche Bank Trust Co., et al.\n\n\n       Having thus identified two state interests that qualified, per NOPSI, for\nQuackenbush balancing against the federal interests, the district court gave short shrift\nto the actual balancing, and summarily concluded that “a balancing of the respective\nfederal and state interests suggests that this court must abstain.” Id. at 716. Deutsche\nBank challenges this conclusion on several grounds.\n\n       First, Deutsche Bank notes that the NOPSI factors represent cognizable state\ninterests weighing in favor of abstention only “where timely and adequate state-court\nreview is available.” NOPSI, 491 U.S. at 361. Deutsche Bank argues that adequate\nreview is unavailable in the housing division of the Cleveland Municipal Court because\nthe sole judge of the housing court has made numerous public statements evidencing his\nbias against banks and mortgage companies in relation to nuisance conditions at vacant\nproperties. We are not persuaded.\n\n       The statements attributed to the housing court judge do not relate specifically to\nthis litigation or the properties here at issue. While the statements may be construed as\nraising questions, they do not necessarily reflect adversely on the housing court judge’s\nability to adjudicate CHRP’s claims fairly and impartially. Under Ohio law, the housing\ncourt judge is subject to disqualification upon a proper showing, and the judge’s rulings\nare subject to appellate review. For these reasons, the statements identified by Deutsche\nBank do not demonstrate that available state-court review is inadequate.\n\n       Next, Deutsche Bank challenges the district court’s reliance on the first NOPSI\nfactor as warranting abstention in relation to CHRP’s common-law public nuisance\nclaim. Deutsche Bank concedes that CHRP’s business practices claim presents a novel\nclaim, but argues it has not been shown to present a “difficult question.” The claim that\nDeutsche Bank’s business practices create a public nuisance is based on Cincinnati v.\nBeretta U.S.A. Corp., 768 N.E.2d 1136 (Ohio 2002). In Beretta, the court reversed\ndismissal of a claim alleging that several gun manufacturers had “created and maintained\na public nuisance by manufacturing, marketing, distributing, and selling firearms in ways\nthat unreasonably interfere with public health, welfare, and safety in Cincinnati.” Id. at\n\fNos. 09-3571/3648          Cleveland Housing Renewal Project v.                  Page 15\n                           Deutsche Bank Trust Co., et al.\n\n\n1141. The Beretta court applied what it called the “broad language” of the Restatement\ndefinition of “public nuisance” as “an unreasonable interference with a right common\nto the general public.” Id. at 1142 (quoting 4 Restatement of the Law 2d, Torts (1965)\n§ 821B(1)). Further, the court defined “unreasonable interference” as including “those\nacts that significantly interfere with public health, safety, peace, comfort, or\nconvenience, conduct that is contrary to a statute, ordinance, or regulation, or conduct\nthat is of a continuing nature or one which has produced a permanent or long-lasting\neffect upon the public right, an effect of which the actor is aware or should be aware.”\nId.\n\n       Considering the broad definitions applied by the Ohio Supreme Court in Beretta\nand the apparent ease with which the court reasoned that the alleged business practices\nof gun manufacturers, distributors and dealers could come within those definitions, it is\nnot immediately apparent what makes CHRP’s business practices claim “difficult,” as\nopposed to merely “novel.” In fact, the Beretta court expressly observed that it had\n“often applied public nuisance law to actions connected to real property.” Id. The Ohio\ncommon law to be applied, derived from the Restatement, thus appears to be settled,\neven though the application of the law to Deutsche Bank’s alleged “business practices”\nmay be novel. A novel question is not necessarily a difficult question; every application\nof settled law to a particular set of factual allegations is unique or novel in some\nrespects.\n\n       Moreover, even if the claim were deemed to represent a “difficult question” of\nstate tort law, it is doubtful that this circumstance alone would justify abstention.\nBurford abstention is concerned with avoiding “difficult questions of state law bearing\non policy problems of substantial public import whose importance transcends the result\nin the case at bar”—questions, whose resolution by a federal court “would be disruptive\nof state efforts to establish a coherent policy.” Colorado River Water Conservation Dist.\nv. United States, 424 U.S. 800, 814 (1976). In other words, not just any difficult\nquestion will do. Neither party has cited and we are unaware of any authority for the\nproposition that Burford abstention is appropriate based solely on the finding of a\n\fNos. 09-3571/3648               Cleveland Housing Renewal Project v.                             Page 16\n                                Deutsche Bank Trust Co., et al.\n\n\ndifficult question of state law—i.e., without there also being a risk of disrupting coherent\nstate policy.\n\n         CHRP relies on Minot v. Eckardt-Minot, 13 F.3d 590 (2d Cir. 1994), where, in\na diversity action, the court, reviewing for abuse of discretion, upheld abstention in\nrelation to the tort claim of “custodial interference,” a “paradigmatic example” of a\n“difficult question of state law.” Id. at 593.1 In Minot, due to “the spectre of local bias,”\nthe court was wary of using abstention to deny an out-of-state litigant the federal forum\nshe preferred. Id. Yet, the court also noted that New York law in this area was newly\ndeveloping and recognition of the tort of custodial interference “would significantly\nchange the landscape of custody disputes.” Id. at 594. The court noted that “questions\nconcerning child custody are peculiarly ill-suited for federal court adjudication.” Id.\n(quoting Casaburro v. Daher, 569 F. Supp. 835, 836 (S.D.N.Y. 1983)). Still, the family\nlaw nature of the controversy alone would not have justified abstention if it had\npresented a simple application of settled law. Id. Rather, it was because the case\nrequired “defining and developing the exact contours of a tort of custodial interference”\nin a context of tangled equities that the state law question was deemed “especially\ncomplicated.” Id. at n.3. The court thus reasoned that “[a] state court should lead the\nway in developing its law in this area, balancing the delicate issues involved here.” Id.\n\n         Here, in contrast, the Ohio common law of public nuisance is settled. The state\nlaw definitions and standards to be applied to CHRP’s novel allegations are clear and\nwell-developed. While land use policy is undoubtedly a matter of substantial public\nconcern, see Saginaw Housing, 576 F.3d at 628, there is no reason to believe that the\nfederal court’s application of settled law to the facts alleged in support of CHRP’s\ncommon law public nuisance claim would be disruptive of any coherent state policy.2\n\n         1\n          Although earlier Sixth Circuit opinions also applied the more deferential abuse-of-discretion\nstandard in reviewing abstention rulings, de novo review is now the rule of this circuit. Saginaw Housing,\n576 F.3d at 625 n.3.\n         2\n            We express no opinion, of course, as to the facial validity of CHRP’s common law public\nnuisance claim. In City of Cleveland v. Ameriquest Mort. Securities, Inc., – F.3d – , 2010 WL 2901049\n(6th Cir., July 27, 2010), a case in which the question of abstention was not raised, we affirmed dismissal\nof an analogous business-practices public nuisance claim for failure to state a claim.\n\fNos. 09-3571/3648          Cleveland Housing Renewal Project v.                   Page 17\n                           Deutsche Bank Trust Co., et al.\n\n\nAccordingly, we conclude the district court erred in holding that the state has a strong\ninterest because the case presents a difficult question of state law.\n\n         Finally, Deutsche Bank also challenges the district court’s assessment of the\nstate’s interest in adjudication of CHRP’s statutory public nuisance claim under the\nsecond NOPSI factor. Relying on Saginaw Housing, a decision rendered after the\ndistrict court issued its abstention ruling, Deutsche Bank contends that Ohio’s interest\nin land use policy and nuisance abatement is not shown to have taken the form of a\ncoherent statewide policy that would be disrupted by federal court adjudication. We\nagree.\n\n         In Saginaw Housing, the Saginaw Housing Commission sought to enjoin the\nconstruction of a halfway house, pursuant to a municipal land use ordinance. Even\nthough the action required interpretation of a local land use ordinance, we reversed the\ndistrict court’s abstention order because there was no evidence that federal involvement\nwould disrupt a coherent state policy. We recognized that both state and local policies\nwere at play, but held that municipalities, unlike states, are not themselves sovereign and\nare not entitled to the same federal deference that the states receive. Saginaw Housing,\n576 F.3d at 626. We acknowledged that the City of Saginaw had implemented the\nsubject ordinance pursuant to state law, the Township Zoning Act. However, the State\nof Michigan had not created an administrative agency to promulgate and administer and\nuniformly enforce state policy.       Nor had the state, in delegating authority to\nmunicipalities under the Township Zoning Act, established substantive standards to\nguide municipalities in creating and enforcing their own ordinances. Id. at 627. We\nfound that the Township Zoning Act did not “display any other hallmarks of a complex\nand uniform approach to land use issues.” Id. at 628. Thus finding minimal evidence\nof a coherent state policy that would be disrupted by federal involvement, we held that\nBurford abstention was inappropriate.\n\fNos. 09-3571/3648             Cleveland Housing Renewal Project v.                          Page 18\n                              Deutsche Bank Trust Co., et al.\n\n\n        The Saginaw Housing opinion emphasizes the importance of a threatened\ndisruption of state efforts as integral to interest-balancing and prerequisite to Burford abstention:\n\n                Burford abstention often protects “complex state administrative\n        processes from undue federal interference.” . . . That said, “it does not\n        require abstention wherever there exists such a process.” . . . “Because\n        Burford abstention is concerned with potential disruption of a state\n        administrative scheme, rather than the mere existence of such a scheme,\n        looking behind the action to determine whether it implicates the concerns\n        of Burford is necessary.” . . . “The key question is whether an erroneous\n        federal court decision could impair the state’s effort to implement its\n        policy.”\n                 ....\n               Every case in which we have found Burford abstention\n        appropriate has involved evidence that federal involvement would disrupt\n        a coherent state policy.\n\nId. at 626 (citations omitted).\n\n        Here, Ohio’s public nuisance statute, R.C. § 3767.41, evidences greater state\nconcern and involvement in local land use regulation than was presented in Saginaw\nHousing. The statute includes a definitional section, incorporating federal regulatory\nstandards in relation to federal subsidized housing. It prescribes the nature of the civil\naction that may be used “to enforce any local building, housing, air pollution, sanitation,\nhealth, fire, zoning, or safety code, ordinance, resolution, or regulation applicable to\nbuildings.” R.C. § 3767.41(B)(1)(a) (emphasis added). The statute also sets forth\nprocedures relating to injunctive relief, authorization of interested parties to abate a\nnuisance, and appointment of a receiver. The statute permits the filing of such an action\nin any appropriate court of common pleas, municipal court, housing or environmental\ndivision of a municipal court, or county court.\n\n        On the other hand, here, as in Saginaw Housing, the state did not create and\nempower an agency to oversee uniform administration and enforcement of a\ncomprehensive statewide regulatory scheme. While the presence of state administrative\nagency involvement is not prerequisite to Burford abstention, it represents an important\n\fNos. 09-3571/3648           Cleveland Housing Renewal Project v.                 Page 19\n                            Deutsche Bank Trust Co., et al.\n\n\nindicator of the state’s interest in implementing a coherent policy. Saginaw Housing,\n576 F.3d at 627. Here, rather, the state has established a general form and procedure for\nenforcement of predominantly local ordinances and regulations and has delegated\nauthority for their enforcement to any of various courts. As the district court noted,\nCleveland Housing, 606 F. Supp. 2d at 714, the state legislature has evidenced special\ninterest in the Cleveland and Toledo housing markets by specifically creating a housing\ndivision in each city’s municipal court and granting it exclusive jurisdiction over public\nnuisance claims arising within its territory. R.C. §§ 1901.011, 1901.181(A)(1). Yet, this\nspecialized interest in the administration of local building ordinances and regulations in\nonly two of the eighty-eight Ohio counties actually weighs against a finding that there\nis a coherent statewide policy. That the housing division of the Cleveland Municipal\nCourt may strive for uniformity in its regulation of the housing market within its local\nterritory is not a factor warranting federal court abstention. Saginaw Housing, 576 F.3d\nat 626.\n\n          Moreover, here, as in Saginaw Housing, there is precious little showing of just\nhow adjudication of CHRP’s statutory public nuisance claim in a federal court in\nCleveland, rather than in the municipal court in Cleveland, applying the very same\nstandards, would disrupt or impair state efforts to implement a statewide policy. As\nSaginaw Housing makes clear, the mere existence of Ohio’s statutory scheme is not\nenough to warrant abstention; there must be a threat of disruption or impairment of the\nstate’s efforts to implement a coherent uniform policy. CHRP has not made a strong\nshowing of a coherent statewide policy or a threatened disruption thereof. Indeed, the\ndistrict court’s finding that CHRP did make a sufficient showing is decidedly\nunconvincing. It consists of one conclusory sentence: “Federal interference in this local\nmatter may disrupt the state’s efforts to have such cases uniformly adjudicated.”\nCleveland Housing, 606 F. Supp. 2d at 716. We are not persuaded.\n\n          We therefore conclude, in relation to the second NOPSI factor, too, that the\ndistrict court erred in finding that Ohio has a strong cognizable interest in state court\nadjudication of CHRP’s statutory public nuisance claim.\n\fNos. 09-3571/3648          Cleveland Housing Renewal Project v.                    Page 20\n                           Deutsche Bank Trust Co., et al.\n\n\n        3. Interest Balancing\n\n        Accordingly, we find that the district court undervalued the importance of the\nfederal interest at stake and overvalued the strength of the state interests. Inasmuch as\nCHRP has failed to demonstrate that its common law public nuisance claim presents a\ndifficult question of state law, and that federal court adjudication of its statutory public\nnuisance claim threatens to disrupt the state’s effort to implement a coherent statewide\npolicy, we hold that the state interests are outweighed by the strong federal interest in\naffording foreign litigants a neutral forum for the adjudication of state law claims against\nthem.   CHRP has failed to show that its complaint presents such extraordinary\ncircumstances as to come within that narrow exception to the exercise of federal\njurisdiction represented by Burford abstention.\n\n                                  III. CONCLUSION\n\n        For the foregoing reasons, we uphold the district court’s realignment of the\nparties to establish complete diversity, as well as its holding that CHRP has standing to\nproceed on its complaint in federal court. Concluding that Burford abstention is not\nwarranted, however, we VACATE the district court’s order remanding the action to the\nstate court, and REMAND the action to the district court for further proceedings on\nCHRP’s complaint.\n\f",

Plaintiff Cleveland Housing Renewal Project, Inc. (\"CHRP\"), filed the action in the Cleveland Municipal Housing Court seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. Deutsche Bank removed the action to federal court based on the parties' diversity of citizenship. However, the district court granted CHRP's motion to remand. The court concluded that subject matter jurisdiction was established by virtue of the parties' diversity of citizenship and that CHRP had standing to proceed in federal court. The court nonetheless remanded the action to state court based on <i>Burford</i> abstention, to avoid federal disruption of a coherent state policy regarding a matter of substantial public concern. Deutsche Bank timely appealed. Finding that abstention is not warranted, we vacate the abstention order and remand the case to the district court for further proceedings on CHRP's complaint.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Plaintiff CHRP is a private non-profit corporation whose principal goal is the improvement and renewal of housing and economic conditions in the City of Cleveland. We accept that the four affiliated Deutsche Bank entities named as defendants comprise a national banking association incorporated under the laws of the United States and include a New York state chartered trust company.</p>\n<p>CHRP filed its complaint on December 15, 2008, in the Cleveland Municipal Housing Court, (1) seeking a declaration that each of twenty-five named residential properties allegedly owned by Deutsche Bank constitutes a \"public nuisance\" as defined by Ohio law, being a menace to the public health, welfare, or safety; and (2) seeking injunctive relief requiring Deutsche Bank to abate the alleged nuisances. The complaint also alleges that Deutsche Bank's \"business practices\" relating to the maintenance and sale of properties subject to foreclosure amount to common-law nuisances, in that homes are sold at extremely distressed prices, purchased by speculators, \"flipped,\" and ultimately abandoned, to the detriment of property values and neighborhood quality. CHRP alleges that Deutsche Bank's practices place homes in a \"post foreclosure death spiral: vacancy → boarded windows and doors → break-ins and vandalism → theft of the home's assets (copper, aluminum, iron) → haven for criminal activity → decrease in neighboring housing values.\" R. 1, Complaint ¶ 5. CHRP also seeks an injunction prohibiting these practices.</p>\n<p>In addition to Deutsche Bank, CHRP named the City of Cleveland as a defendant. The complaint does not allege any cause of action against the City, nor does it seek any relief from the City. The complaint identifies the City as an entity that \"may have or claim to have some interest in real property that is the subject of this <span class=\"star-pagination\">*558</span> action by virtue of code violations, utility assessments and Nuisance abatement costs.\" R. 1, Complaint ¶ 8. In answering the complaint, the City asserted cross-claims against Deutsche Bank. Deutsche Bank removed this action to federal court on the basis of diversity of citizenship.</p>\n<p>CHRP filed a motion to remand, contending primarily that the district court lacked jurisdiction because (i) CHRP lacked Article III and prudential standing; (ii) the City was a non-diverse defendant; and (iii) the jurisdictional amount-in-controversy requirement had not been satisfied. Alternatively, CHRP argued that the district court should abstain from exercising jurisdiction under <i>Burford v. Sun Oil Co.,</i> 319 U.S. 315, 63 S.Ct. 1098, 87 L.Ed. 1424 (1943). Deutsche Bank opposed remand and moved the district court to realign the City as a plaintiff. The district court granted Deutsche Bank's motion for realignment and ruled that it had jurisdiction over CHRP's claims, but declined to exercise jurisdiction under <i>Burford. See </i><i>Cleveland Housing Renewal Project v. Deutsche Bank Trust Co.,</i> 606 F.Supp.2d 698 (N.D.Ohio 2009).</p>\n<p>Deutsche Bank filed a motion to reconsider and presented the district court with \"newly discovered evidence\" concerning the Cleveland Housing Court Judge's alleged bias in this case. The court dismissed the notion of any bias in the housing court, noting that Ohio law provides for disqualification of judges and appellate review of housing court decisions and denied the motion to reconsider. <i>Cleveland Housing Renewal Project v. Deutsche Bank Trust Co.,</i> 2009 WL 1034236 (N.D.Ohio, April 16, 2009). Deutsche Bank timely filed notice of appeal.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. ANALYSIS</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Appellate Jurisdiction</h2>\n<p>We have jurisdiction to decide this appeal. In <i>Quackenbush v. Allstate Ins. Co.,</i> 517 U.S. 706, 711-12, 116 S.Ct. 1712, 135 L.Ed.2d 1 (1996), the Supreme Court held that 28 U.S.C. § 1447(d), which bars appellate review of remand orders in some instances, must be read <i>in pari materia</i> with 28 U.S.C. § 1447(c), \"so that only remands based on grounds specified in § 1447(c) are immune from review under § 1447(d).\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Things Remembered, Inc. v. Petrarca,</i> 516 U.S. 124, 127, 116 S.Ct. 494, 133 L.Ed.2d 461 (1995)). In <i>Quackenbush,</i> the Court held that an abstention-based remand order does not come within a category of remand orders that are immune from review. <i>Id.</i> at 712, 116 S.Ct. 1712. In other words, per <i>Quackenbush,</i> an abstention-based remand order is subject to appellate review.</p>\n<p>CHRP argues that Congress's 1996 amendment of § 1447(c) to include reference to \"[a] motion to remand the case on the basis of any defect other than lack of subject matter jurisdiction\" changes the meaning of § 1447(c) and renders abstention-based remands also immune from appellate review. Yet, in an opinion issued last year, the Supreme Court declined to read the amendment as working a material change. <i>Carlsbad Technology, Inc. v. HIF Bio, Inc.,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 129 S.Ct. 1862, 173 L.Ed.2d 843 (2009). Specifically, the Court recognized that remand orders based on a lack of subject matter jurisdiction are not reviewable, but held that a discretionary decision not to exercise jurisdiction is not a remand for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. <i>Id.</i> at 1866-67. In so ruling, the Court cited with approval <i>Quackenbush's</i> holding that an abstention-based remand is not for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. <i>Id.</i> at 1866. The Court refrained from revisiting the premises of the <i>Quackenbush</i> ruling, <i>id.</i> at 1866 n. *, despite expressed unease over the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*559</span> extent to which the Court's applications of § 1447(d) appear to be at odds with the provision's plain language, <i>see id.</i> at 1868-69 (Scalia, J., concurring, and Souter, J., concurring).</p>\n<p>We follow the Supreme Court's lead. Accordingly, CHRP's objection to appellate jurisdiction is overruled.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Subject Matter Jurisdiction</h2>\n<p>As a second threshold matter, CHRP argues that irrespective of the merits of <i>Burford</i> abstention, the district court's order of remand should be affirmed because the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction in the first place. CHRP contends the parties are not completely diverse and the amount-in-controversy is less than $75,000. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. § 1332. This Court reviews a district court's decision regarding subject matter jurisdiction <i>de novo. </i><i>Loren v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Mich.,</i> 505 F.3d 598, 604 (6th Cir.2007). The party invoking federal court jurisdictionin this case, Deutsche Bank, as removing partyhas the burden of demonstrating by competent proof that the complete-diversity and amount-in-controversy requirements are met. <i>Hertz Corp. v. Friend,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 130 S.Ct. 1181, 1194-95, ___ L.Ed.2d ___ (2010).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. <i>Diversity of Citizenship</i>\n</h2>\n<p>CHRP named the City of Cleveland (\"the City\") as a defendant. Because both CHRP and the City are citizens of Ohio, CHRP argued below that complete diversity of citizenship was lacking and that the district court did not have subject matter jurisdiction. CHRP insisted that the City was a properly joined party, who was not a nominal or formal party, and whose presence was required to avoid the problem of a potential buyer taking the property subject to the City's super-priority lien for unrecorded assessments. The district court, however, granted Deutsche Bank's motion to realign the City as a plaintiff, which created complete diversity between all plaintiffs and all defendants. <i>Cleveland Housing,</i> 606 F.Supp.2d at 709-10. The district court found that CHRP's concerns regarding liens the City might hold on the properties to be ancillary or secondary to the ultimate purpose of the lawsuit, i.e., to abate the conditions creating the nuisance. <i>Id.</i> In relation to the primary dispute in controversy, the district court concluded that the City's interests are aligned with those of CHRP.</p>\n<p>The district court properly recognized that it is the court's responsibility to ensure that the parties are properly aligned according to their interests in the litigation. <i>See </i><i>United States Fidelity and Guar. Co. v. Thomas Solvent Co.,</i> 955 F.2d 1085, 1089 (6th Cir.1992) (citing <i>City of Indianapolis v. Chase Nat'l Bank of City of New York,</i> 314 U.S. 63, 69, 62 S.Ct. 15, 86 L.Ed. 47 (1941)). Parties must \"be aligned in accordance with the primary dispute in the controversy, even where a different, legitimate dispute between the parties supports the original alignment.\" <i>Id.</i> The primary controversy in this case clearly stems from CHRP's demand that Deutsche Bank abate alleged nuisances relating to its properties and be enjoined from creating and maintaining similar nuisances in the future. The purpose of the action is to remedy \"the condition of the vacant, abandoned and foreclosed properties located within the Cleveland neighborhoods [CHRP] serves.\" R. 5-2, Mot. to Remand at 1. The City's interests are not adverse to this purpose. In fact, to the extent that CHRP may be successful, the City will also benefit. The conclusion that CHRP's and the City's interests are aligned, not adverse, in relation to the primary purpose of the litigation is corroborated by the fact that the City filed a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*560</span> cross-claim to recover the costs of abating nuisances at several of the properties at issue. Should CHRP ultimately prevail and obtain injunctive relief, Deutsche Bank will be enjoined from engaging in similar conduct with respect to similar properties in the Cleveland area, potentially sparing the City the costs of future nuisance abatement.</p>\n<p>CHRP does not directly challenge this characterization of the primary controversy between the parties, but argues that the parties' common interests in abating the complained of nuisance conditions are insufficient reason to re-align the parties. Yet, the potentially adverse interests represented by the City's liens on some of the properties are clearly \"ancillary\" or \"secondary\" to the primary controversy. To find error in the district court's realignment of the parties, we would have to disregard the teaching of <i>Thomas Solvent</i> and <i>Indianapolis v. Chase Nat'l Bank.</i> This we are unwilling to do. Accordingly, we hold that the district court properly realigned the City as a plaintiff and properly held there is complete diversity between the parties for purposes of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. <i>Amount in Controversy</i>\n</h2>\n<p>CHRP also challenges the district court's finding that the amount-in-controversy requirement for diversity jurisdiction is met. \"In actions seeking declaratory or injunctive relief, it is well established that the amount in controversy is measured by the value of the object of the litigation.\" <i>Hunt v. Wash. State Apple Adver. Comm'n,</i> 432 U.S. 333, 347, 97 S.Ct. 2434, 53 L.Ed.2d 383 (1977). Additionally, we have observed that the \"costs of complying with an injunction ... may establish the amount-in-controversy.\" <i>Everett v. Verizon Wireless, Inc.,</i> 460 F.3d 818, 829 (6th Cir.2006). Deutsche Bank has the burden of showing that the requirement \"more likely than not\" is satisfied. <i>Everett,</i> 460 F.3d at 822.</p>\n<p>The district court was persuaded by Deutsche Bank's showing that injunctive relief requiring it to abate the alleged nuisances or demolish the twenty-five residential properties and requiring it to alter its business practices would result in costs to Deutsche Bank in excess of $75,000. <i>Cleveland Housing,</i> 606 F.Supp.2d at 711. Again, CHRP does not directly challenge the district court's finding, but argues that the amount in controversy should be determined from its viewpoint, rather than Deutsche Bank's. CHRP does not explain what the value of injunctive relief would be or how the value of such relief should be assessed, but asserts simply that the value of the relief is less than $75,000.</p>\n<p>While the value of the requested injunctive relief to CHRP may be difficult to quantify, the notion that abatement of nuisances on twenty-five parcels of abandoned property would amount to improvement valued at less than $75,000 is patently suspect. CHRP seeks to have twenty-five properties declared public nuisances and require the defendants to abate each nuisance, which may include, according to the complaint, replacement of the home's assets, such as copper or aluminum, repairing or replacing doors and windows, and repairing vandalism damage. As an alternative to abating the twenty-five properties at issue in this litigation, CHRP seeks to have the properties demolished.</p>\n<p>Deutsche Bank has satisfactorily shown that it is \"more likely than not\" that the amount-in-controversy requirement is met. The district court recognized that the Cuyahoga County Auditor's valuation of the twenty-five properties at a total of more than $1.3 million is likely inflated, but correctly concluded that potential demolition of even just several properties would likely <span class=\"star-pagination\">*561</span> result in costs exceeding $75,000. <i>Id.</i> Indeed, common sense dictates that the significant remedial measures or complete destruction of the properties CHRP seeks would certainly cost, on average, in excess of $3,000 per structure. In its rather perfunctory challenge to the district court's amount-in-controversy determination, CHRP has failed to show error.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, we hold that the district court properly satisfied itself of its subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1332.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. Article III Standing</h2>\n<p>Even if subject matter jurisdiction is established, CHRP maintains that remand to state court is warranted on the ground that it lacks standing to proceed with its claims in federal court. The district court overruled the objection, holding that CHRP does have standing. The district court correctly identified and applied the three constitutional standing requirements: (1) injury in fact, (2) traceable to the defendant's challenged actions, (3) which is redressable by a favorable decision. <i>Cleveland Housing,</i> 606 F.Supp.2d at 705 (citing <i>Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs. (TOC), Inc.,</i> 528 U.S. 167, 181-82, 120 S.Ct. 693, 145 L.Ed.2d 610 (2000), and <i>Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife,</i> 504 U.S. 555, 560-61, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992)). The district court concluded that CHRP had adequately alleged cognizable injury to its organizational efforts to renew and improve blighted Cleveland neighborhoods. <i>Id.</i> at 705-08 (citing <i>Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman,</i> 455 U.S. 363, 379, 102 S.Ct. 1114, 71 L.Ed.2d 214 (1982)). The district court was also satisfied that CHRP's complaint contained adequate allegations that the injury was traceable to Deutsche Bank's practices and that the injury was redressable through injunctive relief.</p>\n<p>Further, the district court recognized that there are also \"several judicially self-imposed limitations on the exercise of federal jurisdiction, such as the general prohibition on a litigant's raising another person's legal rights, the rule barring adjudication of generalized grievances more appropriately addressed in the representative branches, and the requirement that a plaintiff's complaint fall within the zone of interests protected by the law invoked.\" <i>Allen v. Wright,</i> 468 U.S. 737, 751, 104 S.Ct. 3315, 82 L.Ed.2d 556 (1984). The court held that CHRP's complaint meets all of these prudential requirements. <i>Cleveland Housing,</i> 606 F.Supp.2d at 708-09.</p>\n<p>On appeal, CHRP has not mounted a serious challenge to the district court's analysis of the constitutional or prudential standing requirements. Indeed, we find no error in the district court's holding that CHRP has standing to prosecute this action in federal court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. <i>Burford</i> Abstention</h2>\n<p>The district court remanded the case to state court based on <i>Burford</i> abstention. The Supreme Court ruled in <i>Burford v. Sun Oil Co.,</i> 319 U.S. 315, 63 S.Ct. 1098, 87 L.Ed. 1424 (1943), that federal courts \"should exercise their discretionary power with proper regard for the rightful independence of state governments in carrying out their domestic policy.\" <i>Id.</i> at 318, 63 S.Ct. 1098. The district court's decision to abstain is reviewed <i>de novo. See </i><i>Saginaw Housing Com'n v. Bannum, Inc.,</i> 576 F.3d 620, 625 (6th Cir. 2009).</p>\n<p>There are two leading Supreme Court rulings on <i>Burford</i> abstention, <i>Quackenbush v. Allstate Ins. Co.,</i> 517 U.S. 706, 116 S.Ct. 1712, 135 L.Ed.2d 1 (1996), and <i>New Orleans Public Service, Inc. v. Council of City of New Orleans,</i> 491 U.S. 350, 109 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*562</span> S.Ct. 2506, 105 L.Ed.2d 298 (1989) (<i>\"NOPSI\"</i>). In <i>Quackenbush,</i> the Court observed that <i>Burford</i> abstention is a matter of equitable discretion reflecting principles of federalism and comity and requiring the balancing of federal interests in retaining jurisdiction against the competing concern for the independence of state action:</p>\n<blockquote>The equitable decision balances the <i>strong federal interest</i> in having certain classes of cases, and certain federal rights, adjudicated in federal court, against the State's interests in maintaining uniformity in the treatment of an essentially local problem, and retaining local control over difficult questions of state law bearing on policy problems of substantial public import. This balance only <i>rarely</i> favors abstention, and the power to dismiss recognized in <i>Burford</i> represents an <i>extraordinary</i> and <i>narrow</i> exception to the duty of the District Court to adjudicate a controversy properly before it.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Quackenbush,</i> 517 U.S. at 728, 116 S.Ct. 1712 (citations and quotation marks omitted; emphasis added). The <i>Quackenbush</i> Court noted that its overruling of abstention in <i>NOPSI</i> represented a recent application of these principles in relation to a claim of federal preemption of state administrative proceedings, illustrating the narrow range of circumstances in which <i>Burford</i> abstention may be justified. <i>Id.</i> at 726, 116 S.Ct. 1712. The Court characterized the <i>NOPSI</i> ruling as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>We thus indicated that <i>Burford</i> allows a federal court to dismiss a case only if it presents \"`difficult questions of state law bearing on policy problems of substantial public import whose importance transcends the result in the case then at bar,'\" or if its adjudication in a federal forum \"`would be disruptive of state efforts to establish a coherent policy with respect to a matter of substantial public concern.'\"</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 726-27, 116 S.Ct. 1712 (quoting <i>NOPSI,</i> 491 U.S. at 361, 109 S.Ct. 2506).</p>\n<p>In <i>NOPSI,</i> the state interests were evidenced by a state administrative regulatory scheme, but such a statewide regulatory scheme is not necessarily prerequisite to <i>Burford</i> abstention. <i>Saginaw Housing,</i> 576 F.3d at 627. Because <i>Burford</i> abstention is concerned with potential disruption of a state regulatory scheme, \"[t]he key question is whether an erroneous federal court decision could impair the state's effort to implement its policy.\" <i>Id.</i> at 626 (quoting <i>Ada-Cascade Watch Co., Inc. v. Cascade Res. Recovery, Inc.,</i> 720 F.2d 897, 903 (6th Cir.1983)).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. <i>Federal Interests</i>\n</h2>\n<p>First, we examine the federal interests. The instant action, removed based on the parties' diversity, falls within one of those \"classes of cases\" to which a \"strong federal interest\" attaches. <i>Quackenbush,</i> 517 U.S. at 728, 116 S.Ct. 1712. Unlike <i>Quackenbush,</i> which involved the Federal Arbitration Act, and <i>NOPSI,</i> which presented a question of federal preemption, no federal statute or federal right is implicated in this case. CHRP's complaint is premised exclusively on Ohio state law. There is, however, a strong federal interest in adjudicating cases brought under the congressional grant of diversity jurisdiction:</p>\n<blockquote>By conferring jurisdiction on the federal courts in diversity cases through 28 U.S.C. § 1332, Congress intended a uniformly administered federal judicial system, which affords litigants of diverse citizenship convenient forums in which to vindicate their rights. Although the basic Congressional purpose behind the grant of diversity jurisdiction was to protect out-of-state suitors <span class=\"star-pagination\">*563</span> from the prejudice of state courts,.... the Congressional purpose was broader. By vesting the federal district courts with equity jurisdiction and guaranteeing adequate appeals within the federal judicial system, Congress afforded procedures and remedies that were not available in the courts of several states.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Miller v. Davis,</i> 507 F.2d 308, 316-317 (6th Cir.1974) (footnote, citations omitted).</p>\n<p>The district court was cognizant of the federal interest in diversity jurisdiction, but noted that such interest was \"particularly strong\" in <i>Miller</i> because that case involved a large nationwide pension fund. The district court determined that the federal interest in affording a federal forum for CHRP's complaint is not as strong because no such national concern is presented in this case. <i>Cleveland Housing,</i> 606 F.Supp.2d at 713.</p>\n<p>Deutsche Bank insists there are federal interests in this case beyond the virtues of diversity jurisdiction, noting that Congress has recently appropriated $2 billion for the redevelopment of real estate markets in distress due to foreclosures. Deutsche Bank also points to various governmental organizations and programs designed to address the problem of home foreclosures throughout the country as evidence that this case touches on matters of nationwide import. Indeed, we can take judicial notice of the fact that residential foreclosures represent a nationwide epidemic that has precipitated various governmental remedial measures. Yet, this carries little weight in measuring the federal interests in adjudicating the claims asserted in CHRP's complaint. This action is not addressed to the problems associated with residential foreclosures generally; it is aimed at abating nuisances allegedly caused by Deutsche Bank at twenty-five identified locations in the Cleveland area. The fact that government funds have been appropriated to address the nation's foreclosure crisis does not affect the application of Ohio public nuisance law in relation to the twenty-five properties in Cleveland.</p>\n<p>Nor are we impressed by Deutsche Bank's argument that CHRP's \"broadside attack\" on Deutsche Bank's \"business practices\" could result in imposition of local restrictions on the national operations of federally regulated businesses. The argument hints at the notion of federal preemption, but is based only on potential conflicts too speculative to materially enhance the federal interests weighing against <i>Burford</i> abstention.</p>\n<p>Yet, though unpersuaded by Deutsche Bank's arguments that there are federal interests beyond the virtues of diversity jurisdiction, we believe the district court improperly undervalued the strength of the federal interest in affording a neutral forum for the adjudication of disputes between parties of diverse citizenship. The district court characterized the federal interest based on diversity jurisdiction <i>sans</i> other federal rights as being \"at its nadir.\" <i>Cleveland Housing,</i> 606 F.Supp.2d at 714. The court's implicit conclusion that diversity jurisdiction represents a \"strong\" federal interest only if accompanied by <i>other</i> federal interests is based on a faulty negative inference. In <i>Miller v. Davis</i><i>,</i> as the district court observed, there were, in addition to diversity jurisdiction, other federal interests that helped render abstention inappropriate. Yet this does not compel the conclusion that abstention <i>is</i> appropriate if diversity jurisdiction represents the only strong federal interest. Additional federal interests make an already strong federal interest stronger, but their absence does not render an already strong federal interest weak.</p>\n<p>In our opinion, the importance of diversity jurisdiction is particularly strong in this case, where the state law claims (a) <span class=\"star-pagination\">*564</span> are of intense local concern, (b) are asserted against not just citizens of different states, but affiliates of manifestly \"foreign\" (i.e., German) corporations, and (c) would otherwise be adjudicated by a locally-elected municipal judge. The district court's minimization of the \"strong federal interest\" in affording Deutsche Bank a neutral forum for the adjudication of CHRP's state law claims is a flaw that materially affected its interest-balancing analysis.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. <i>State Interests</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The state interests that may be deemed to outweigh the federal interests must stem from the need to maintain uniformity in the treatment of an essentially local problem, and the need to retain local control over difficult questions of state law bearing on policy problems of substantial public import. <i>Quackenbush,</i> 517 U.S. at 728, 116 S.Ct. 1712. The district court noted that the Ohio legislature had expressed a strong interest in the Cleveland housing market by (1) establishing a specialized housing division in the Cleveland Municipal Court with exclusive jurisdiction over statutory public nuisance claims; and (2) authorizing Cuyahoga County (the county surrounding Cleveland) to create a land reutilization corporation for the purpose of promoting reclamation and development and managing of vacant real property. <i>Cleveland Housing,</i> 606 F.Supp.2d at 714-15. Further, with reference to the first <i>NOPSI</i> factor, the district court held that CHRP's common-law public nuisance claim, attacking Deutsche Bank's \"business practices,\" presents a difficult question of state law bearing on policy problems of substantial public import. <i>Id.</i> at 715. As to the second factor, the district court held that federal adjudication of CHRP's statutory public nuisance claim could disrupt state efforts to establish a coherent policy through uniform adjudication of such claims in the specialized housing division of the municipal court. <i>Id.</i> at 715-16.</p>\n<p>Having thus identified two state interests that qualified, per <i>NOPSI,</i> for <i>Quackenbush</i> balancing against the federal interests, the district court gave short shrift to the actual balancing, and summarily concluded that \"a balancing of the respective federal and state interests suggests that this court must abstain.\" <i>Id.</i> at 716, 116 S.Ct. 1712. Deutsche Bank challenges this conclusion on several grounds.</p>\n<p>First, Deutsche Bank notes that the <i>NOPSI</i> factors represent cognizable state interests weighing in favor of abstention only \"where timely and adequate state-court review is available.\" <i>NOPSI,</i> 491 U.S. at 361, 109 S.Ct. 2506. Deutsche Bank argues that adequate review is unavailable in the housing division of the Cleveland Municipal Court because the sole judge of the housing court has made numerous public statements evidencing his bias against banks and mortgage companies in relation to nuisance conditions at vacant properties. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p>The statements attributed to the housing court judge do not relate specifically to this litigation or the properties here at issue. While the statements may be construed as raising questions, they do not necessarily reflect adversely on the housing court judge's ability to adjudicate CHRP's claims fairly and impartially. Under Ohio law, the housing court judge is subject to disqualification upon a proper showing, and the judge's rulings are subject to appellate review. For these reasons, the statements identified by Deutsche Bank do not demonstrate that available state-court review is inadequate.</p>\n<p>Next, Deutsche Bank challenges the district court's reliance on the first <i>NOPSI</i> factor as warranting abstention in relation to CHRP's common-law public <span class=\"star-pagination\">*565</span> nuisance claim. Deutsche Bank concedes that CHRP's business practices claim presents a novel claim, but argues it has not been shown to present a \"difficult question.\" The claim that Deutsche Bank's business practices create a public nuisance is based on <i>Cincinnati v. Beretta U.S.A. Corp.,</i> 95 Ohio St.3d 416, 768 N.E.2d 1136 (2002). In <i>Beretta,</i> the court reversed dismissal of a claim alleging that several gun manufacturers had \"created and maintained a public nuisance by manufacturing, marketing, distributing, and selling firearms in ways that unreasonably interfere with public health, welfare, and safety in Cincinnati.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1141. The <i>Beretta</i> court applied what it called the \"broad language\" of the Restatement definition of \"public nuisance\" as \"an unreasonable interference with a right common to the general public.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1142 (quoting 4 Restatement of the Law 2d, Torts (1965) § 821B(1)). Further, the court defined \"unreasonable interference\" as including \"those acts that significantly interfere with public health, safety, peace, comfort, or convenience, conduct that is contrary to a statute, ordinance, or regulation, or conduct that is of a continuing nature or one which has produced a permanent or long-lasting effect upon the public right, an effect of which the actor is aware or should be aware.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Considering the broad definitions applied by the Ohio Supreme Court in <i>Beretta</i> and the apparent ease with which the court reasoned that the alleged business practices of gun manufacturers, distributors and dealers could come within those definitions, it is not immediately apparent what makes CHRP's business practices claim \"difficult,\" as opposed to merely \"novel.\" In fact, the <i>Beretta</i> court expressly observed that it had \"often applied public nuisance law to actions connected to real property.\" <i>Id.</i> The Ohio common law to be applied, derived from the Restatement, thus appears to be settled, even though the application of the law to Deutsche Bank's alleged \"business practices\" may be novel. A novel question is not necessarily a difficult question; every application of settled law to a particular set of factual allegations is unique or novel in some respects.</p>\n<p>Moreover, even if the claim were deemed to represent a \"difficult question\" of state tort law, it is doubtful that this circumstance alone would justify abstention. <i>Burford</i> abstention is concerned with avoiding \"difficult questions of state law bearing on policy problems of substantial public import whose importance transcends the result in the case at bar\" questions, whose resolution by a federal court \"would be disruptive of state efforts to establish a coherent policy.\" <i>Colorado River Water Conservation Dist. v. United States,</i> 424 U.S. 800, 814, 96 S.Ct. 1236, 47 L.Ed.2d 483 (1976). In other words, not just any difficult question will do. Neither party has cited and we are unaware of any authority for the proposition that <i>Burford</i> abstention is appropriate based solely on the finding of a difficult question of state lawi.e., without there also being a risk of disrupting coherent state policy.</p>\n<p>CHRP relies on <i>Minot v. Eckardt-Minot,</i> 13 F.3d 590 (2d Cir.1994), where, in a diversity action, the court, reviewing for abuse of discretion, upheld abstention in relation to the tort claim of \"custodial interference,\" a \"paradigmatic example\" of a \"difficult question of state law.\" <i>Id.</i> at 593.<sup>[1]</sup> In <i>Minot,</i> due to \"the spectre of local bias,\" the court was wary of using <span class=\"star-pagination\">*566</span> abstention to deny an out-of-state litigant the federal forum she preferred. <i>Id.</i> Yet, the court also noted that New York law in this area was newly developing and recognition of the tort of custodial interference \"would significantly change the landscape of custody disputes.\" <i>Id.</i> at 594. The court noted that \"questions concerning child custody are peculiarly ill-suited for federal court adjudication.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Casaburro v. Daher,</i> 569 F.Supp. 835, 836 (S.D.N.Y.1983)). Still, the family law nature of the controversy alone would not have justified abstention if it had presented a simple application of settled law. <i>Id.</i> Rather, it was because the case required \"defining and developing the exact contours of a tort of custodial interference\" in a context of tangled equities that the state law question was deemed \"especially complicated.\" <i>Id.</i> at n. 3. The court thus reasoned that \"[a] state court should lead the way in developing its law in this area, balancing the delicate issues involved here.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Here, in contrast, the Ohio common law of public nuisance is settled. The state law definitions and standards to be applied to CHRP's novel allegations are clear and well-developed. While land use policy is undoubtedly a matter of substantial public concern, <i>see </i><i>Saginaw Housing,</i> 576 F.3d at 628, there is no reason to believe that the federal court's application of settled law to the facts alleged in support of CHRP's common law public nuisance claim would be disruptive of any coherent state policy.<sup>[2]</sup> Accordingly, we conclude the district court erred in holding that the state has a strong interest because the case presents a difficult question of state law.</p>\n<p>Finally, Deutsche Bank also challenges the district court's assessment of the state's interest in adjudication of CHRP's statutory public nuisance claim under the second <i>NOPSI</i> factor. Relying on <i>Saginaw Housing,</i> a decision rendered after the district court issued its abstention ruling, Deutsche Bank contends that Ohio's interest in land use policy and nuisance abatement is not shown to have taken the form of a coherent statewide policy that would be disrupted by federal court adjudication. We agree.</p>\n<p>In <i>Saginaw Housing,</i> the Saginaw Housing Commission sought to enjoin the construction of a halfway house, pursuant to a <i>municipal</i> land use ordinance. Even though the action required interpretation of a local land use ordinance, we reversed the district court's abstention order because there was no evidence that federal involvement would disrupt a coherent state policy. We recognized that both state and local policies were at play, but held that municipalities, unlike states, are not themselves sovereign and are not entitled to the same federal deference that the states receive. <i>Saginaw Housing,</i> 576 F.3d at 626. We acknowledged that the City of Saginaw had implemented the subject ordinance pursuant to state law, the Township Zoning Act. However, the State of Michigan had not created an administrative agency to promulgate and administer and uniformly enforce state policy. Nor had the state, in delegating authority to municipalities under the Township Zoning Act, established substantive standards to guide municipalities in creating and enforcing their own ordinances. <i>Id.</i> at 627. We found that the Township Zoning Act did <span class=\"star-pagination\">*567</span> not \"display any other hallmarks of a complex and uniform approach to land use issues.\" <i>Id.</i> at 628. Thus finding minimal evidence of a coherent state policy that would be disrupted by federal involvement, we held that <i>Burford</i> abstention was inappropriate.</p>\n<p>The <i>Saginaw Housing</i> opinion emphasizes the importance of a threatened disruption of state efforts as integral to interest-balancing and prerequisite to <i>Burford</i> abstention:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<i>Burford</i> abstention often protects \"complex state administrative processes from undue federal interference.\" ... That said, \"it does not require abstention wherever there exists such a process.\"... \"Because <i>Burford</i> abstention is concerned with potential disruption of a state administrative scheme, rather than the mere existence of such a scheme, looking behind the action to determine whether it implicates the concerns of <i>Burford</i> is necessary.\"... \"The key question is whether an erroneous federal court decision could impair the state's effort to implement its policy.\"</blockquote>\n<blockquote>....</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Every case in which we have found <i>Burford</i> abstention appropriate has involved evidence that federal involvement would disrupt a coherent state policy.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 626 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p>Here, Ohio's public nuisance statute, R.C. § 3767.41, evidences greater state concern and involvement in local land use regulation than was presented in <i>Saginaw Housing.</i> The statute includes a definitional section, incorporating federal regulatory standards in relation to federal subsidized housing. It prescribes the nature of the civil action that may be used \"to enforce <i>any</i> local building, housing, air pollution, sanitation, health, fire, zoning, or safety code, ordinance, resolution, or regulation applicable to buildings.\" R.C. § 3767.41(B)(1)(a) (emphasis added). The statute also sets forth procedures relating to injunctive relief, authorization of interested parties to abate a nuisance, and appointment of a receiver. The statute permits the filing of such an action in any appropriate court of common pleas, municipal court, housing or environmental division of a municipal court, or county court.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, here, as in <i>Saginaw Housing,</i> the state did not create and empower an agency to oversee uniform administration and enforcement of a comprehensive statewide regulatory scheme. While the presence of state administrative agency involvement is not prerequisite to <i>Burford</i> abstention, it represents an important indicator of the state's interest in implementing a coherent policy. <i>Saginaw Housing,</i> 576 F.3d at 627. Here, rather, the state has established a general form and procedure for enforcement of predominantly <i>local</i> ordinances and regulations and has delegated authority for their enforcement to any of various courts. As the district court noted, <i>Cleveland Housing,</i> 606 F.Supp.2d at 714, the state legislature has evidenced special interest in the Cleveland and Toledo housing markets by specifically creating a housing division in each city's municipal court and granting it exclusive jurisdiction over public nuisance claims arising within its territory. R.C. §§ 1901.011, 1901.181(A)(1). Yet, this specialized interest in the administration of local building ordinances and regulations in only two of the eighty-eight Ohio counties actually weighs against a finding that there is a coherent <i>statewide</i> policy. That the housing division of the Cleveland Municipal Court may strive for uniformity in its regulation of the housing market within its local territory is not a factor warranting federal court abstention. <i>Saginaw Housing,</i> 576 F.3d at 626.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*568</span> Moreover, here, as in <i>Saginaw Housing,</i> there is precious little showing of just how adjudication of CHRP's statutory public nuisance claim in a federal court in Cleveland, rather than in the municipal court in Cleveland, applying the very same standards, would disrupt or impair state efforts to implement a statewide policy. As <i>Saginaw Housing</i> makes clear, the mere existence of Ohio's statutory scheme is not enough to warrant abstention; there must be a threat of disruption or impairment of the state's efforts to implement a coherent uniform policy. CHRP has not made a strong showing of a coherent statewide policy or a threatened disruption thereof. Indeed, the district court's finding that CHRP <i>did</i> make a sufficient showing is decidedly unconvincing. It consists of one conclusory sentence: \"Federal interference in this local matter may disrupt the state's efforts to have such cases uniformly adjudicated.\" <i>Cleveland Housing,</i> 606 F.Supp.2d at 716. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p>We therefore conclude, in relation to the second <i>NOPSI</i> factor, too, that the district court erred in finding that Ohio has a strong cognizable interest in state court adjudication of CHRP's statutory public nuisance claim.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. <i>Interest Balancing</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Accordingly, we find that the district court undervalued the importance of the federal interest at stake and overvalued the strength of the state interests. Inasmuch as CHRP has failed to demonstrate that its common law public nuisance claim presents a difficult question of state law, and that federal court adjudication of its statutory public nuisance claim threatens to disrupt the state's effort to implement a coherent statewide policy, we hold that the state interests are outweighed by the strong federal interest in affording foreign litigants a neutral forum for the adjudication of state law claims against them. CHRP has failed to show that its complaint presents such extraordinary circumstances as to come within that narrow exception to the exercise of federal jurisdiction represented by <i>Burford</i> abstention.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, we uphold the district court's realignment of the parties to establish complete diversity, as well as its holding that CHRP has standing to proceed on its complaint in federal court. Concluding that <i>Burford</i> abstention is not warranted, however, we VACATE the district court's order remanding the action to the state court, and REMAND the action to the district court for further proceedings on CHRP's complaint.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  The Honorable Joseph M.

Plaintiff Cleveland Housing Renewal Project, Inc. (\"CHRP\"), filed the action in the Cleveland Municipal Housing Court seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. Deutsche Bank removed the action to federal court based on the parties' diversity of citizenship. However, the district court granted CHRP's motion to remand. The court concluded that subject matter jurisdiction was established by virtue of the parties' diversity of citizenship and that CHRP had standing to proceed in federal court. The court nonetheless remanded the action to state court based on <i>Burford</i> abstention, to avoid federal disruption of a coherent state policy regarding a matter of substantial public concern. Deutsche Bank timely appealed. Finding that abstention is not warranted, we vacate the abstention order and remand the case to the district court for further proceedings on CHRP's complaint.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Plaintiff CHRP is a private non-profit corporation whose principal goal is the improvement and renewal of housing and economic conditions in the City of Cleveland. We accept that the four affiliated Deutsche Bank entities named as defendants comprise a national banking association incorporated under the laws of the United States and include a New York state chartered trust company.</p>\n<p>CHRP filed its complaint on December 15, 2008, in the Cleveland Municipal Housing Court, (1) seeking a declaration that each of twenty-five named residential properties allegedly owned by Deutsche Bank constitutes a \"public nuisance\" as defined by Ohio law, being a menace to the public health, welfare, or safety; and (2) seeking injunctive relief requiring Deutsche Bank to abate the alleged nuisances. The complaint also alleges that Deutsche Bank's \"business practices\" relating to the maintenance and sale of properties subject to foreclosure amount to common-law nuisances, in that homes are sold at extremely distressed prices, purchased by speculators, \"flipped,\" and ultimately abandoned, to the detriment of property values and neighborhood quality. CHRP alleges that Deutsche Bank's practices place homes in a \"post foreclosure death spiral: vacancy → boarded windows and doors → break-ins and vandalism → theft of the home's assets (copper, aluminum, iron) → haven for criminal activity → decrease in neighboring housing values.\" R. 1, Complaint ¶ 5. CHRP also seeks an injunction prohibiting these practices.</p>\n<p>In addition to Deutsche Bank, CHRP named the City of Cleveland as a defendant. The complaint does not allege any cause of action against the City, nor does it seek any relief from the City. The complaint identifies the City as an entity that \"may have or claim to have some interest in real property that is the subject of this <span class=\"star-pagination\">*558</span> action by virtue of code violations, utility assessments and Nuisance abatement costs.\" R. 1, Complaint ¶ 8. In answering the complaint, the City asserted cross-claims against Deutsche Bank. Deutsche Bank removed this action to federal court on the basis of diversity of citizenship.</p>\n<p>CHRP filed a motion to remand, contending primarily that the district court lacked jurisdiction because (i) CHRP lacked Article III and prudential standing; (ii) the City was a non-diverse defendant; and (iii) the jurisdictional amount-in-controversy requirement had not been satisfied. Alternatively, CHRP argued that the district court should abstain from exercising jurisdiction under <i>Burford v. Sun Oil Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103842\"><a href=\"/opinion/103842/burford-v-sun-oil-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">319</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">315</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">63</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">1424</span></span> (1943). Deutsche Bank opposed remand and moved the district court to realign the City as a plaintiff. The district court granted Deutsche Bank's motion for realignment and ruled that it had jurisdiction over CHRP's claims, but declined to exercise jurisdiction under <i>Burford. See </i><i>Cleveland Housing Renewal Project v. Deutsche Bank Trust Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2157433\"><a href=\"/opinion/2157433/chrp-v-deutsche-bank-trust-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">606</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">698</span></a></span> (N.D.Ohio 2009).</p>\n<p>Deutsche Bank filed a motion to reconsider and presented the district court with \"newly discovered evidence\" concerning the Cleveland Housing Court Judge's alleged bias in this case. The court dismissed the notion of any bias in the housing court, noting that Ohio law provides for disqualification of judges and appellate review of housing court decisions and denied the motion to reconsider. <i>Cleveland Housing Renewal Project v. Deutsche Bank Trust Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2009</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1034236</span></span> (N.D.Ohio, April 16, 2009). Deutsche Bank timely filed notice of appeal.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. ANALYSIS</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Appellate Jurisdiction</h2>\n<p>We have jurisdiction to decide this appeal. In <i>Quackenbush v. Allstate Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118031\"><a href=\"/opinion/118031/quackenbush-v-allstate-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">517</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">706</span></a></span>, 711-12, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118031\"><a href=\"/opinion/118031/quackenbush-v-allstate-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span> (1996), the Supreme Court held that 28 U.S.C. § 1447(d), which bars appellate review of remand orders in some instances, must be read <i>in pari materia</i> with 28 U.S.C. § 1447(c), \"so that only remands based on grounds specified in § 1447(c) are immune from review under § 1447(d).\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Things Remembered, Inc. v. Petrarca,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117984\"><a href=\"/opinion/117984/things-remembered-inc-v-petrarca/\"><span class=\"volume\">516</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">124</span></a></span>, 127, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117984\"><a href=\"/opinion/117984/things-remembered-inc-v-petrarca/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">461</span></a></span> (1995)). In <i>Quackenbush,</i> the Court held that an abstention-based remand order does not come within a category of remand orders that are immune from review. <i>Id.</i> at 712, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118031\"><a href=\"/opinion/118031/quackenbush-v-allstate-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1712</span></a></span>. In other words, per <i>Quackenbush,</i> an abstention-based remand order is subject to appellate review.</p>\n<p>CHRP argues that Congress's 1996 amendment of § 1447(c) to include reference to \"[a] motion to remand the case on the basis of any defect other than lack of subject matter jurisdiction\" changes the meaning of § 1447(c) and renders abstention-based remands also immune from appellate review. Yet, in an opinion issued last year, the Supreme Court declined to read the amendment as working a material change. <i>Carlsbad Technology, Inc. v. HIF Bio, Inc.,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145877\"><a href=\"/opinion/145877/carlsbad-technology-inc-v-hif-bio-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1862</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145877\"><a href=\"/opinion/145877/carlsbad-technology-inc-v-hif-bio-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">173</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">843</span></a></span> (2009). Specifically, the Court recognized that remand orders based on a lack of subject matter jurisdiction are not reviewable, but held that a discretionary decision not to exercise jurisdiction is not a remand for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. <i>Id.</i> at 1866-67. In so ruling, the Court cited with approval <i>Quackenbush's</i> holding that an abstention-based remand is not for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. <i>Id.</i> at 1866. The Court refrained from revisiting the premises of the <i>Quackenbush</i> ruling, <i>id.</i> at 1866 n. *, despite expressed unease over the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*559</span> extent to which the Court's applications of § 1447(d) appear to be at odds with the provision's plain language, <i>see id.</i> at 1868-69 (Scalia, J., concurring, and Souter, J., concurring).</p>\n<p>We follow the Supreme Court's lead. Accordingly, CHRP's objection to appellate jurisdiction is overruled.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Subject Matter Jurisdiction</h2>\n<p>As a second threshold matter, CHRP argues that irrespective of the merits of <i>Burford</i> abstention, the district court's order of remand should be affirmed because the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction in the first place. CHRP contends the parties are not completely diverse and the amount-in-controversy is less than $75,000. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. § 1332. This Court reviews a district court's decision regarding subject matter jurisdiction <i>de novo. </i><i>Loren v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Mich.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1384668\"><a href=\"/opinion/1384668/loren-v-blue-cross-blue-shield-of-mich/\"><span class=\"volume\">505</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">598</span></a></span>, 604 (6th Cir.2007). The party invoking federal court jurisdictionin this case, Deutsche Bank, as removing partyhas the burden of demonstrating by competent proof that the complete-diversity and amount-in-controversy requirements are met. <i>Hertz Corp. v. Friend,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1735\"><a href=\"/opinion/1735/hertz-corp-v-friend/\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1181</span></a></span>, 1194-95, ___ L.Ed.2d ___ (2010).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. <i>Diversity of Citizenship</i>\n</h2>\n<p>CHRP named the City of Cleveland (\"the City\") as a defendant. Because both CHRP and the City are citizens of Ohio, CHRP argued below that complete diversity of citizenship was lacking and that the district court did not have subject matter jurisdiction. CHRP insisted that the City was a properly joined party, who was not a nominal or formal party, and whose presence was required to avoid the problem of a potential buyer taking the property subject to the City's super-priority lien for unrecorded assessments. The district court, however, granted Deutsche Bank's motion to realign the City as a plaintiff, which created complete diversity between all plaintiffs and all defendants. <i>Cleveland Housing,</i> 606 F.Supp.2d at 709-10. The district court found that CHRP's concerns regarding liens the City might hold on the properties to be ancillary or secondary to the ultimate purpose of the lawsuit, i.e., to abate the conditions creating the nuisance. <i>Id.</i> In relation to the primary dispute in controversy, the district court concluded that the City's interests are aligned with those of CHRP.</p>\n<p>The district court properly recognized that it is the court's responsibility to ensure that the parties are properly aligned according to their interests in the litigation. <i>See </i><i>United States Fidelity and Guar. Co. v. Thomas Solvent Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"577144\"><a href=\"/opinion/577144/united-states-fidelity-and-guaranty-co-canadian-universal-insurance-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">955</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1085</span></a></span>, 1089 (6th Cir.1992) (citing <i>City of Indianapolis v. Chase Nat'l Bank of City of New York,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">314</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">63</span></span>, 69, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">62</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">86</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">47</span></span> (1941)). Parties must \"be aligned in accordance with the primary dispute in the controversy, even where a different, legitimate dispute between the parties supports the original alignment.\" <i>Id.</i> The primary controversy in this case clearly stems from CHRP's demand that Deutsche Bank abate alleged nuisances relating to its properties and be enjoined from creating and maintaining similar nuisances in the future. The purpose of the action is to remedy \"the condition of the vacant, abandoned and foreclosed properties located within the Cleveland neighborhoods [CHRP] serves.\" R. 5-2, Mot. to Remand at 1. The City's interests are not adverse to this purpose. In fact, to the extent that CHRP may be successful, the City will also benefit. The conclusion that CHRP's and the City's interests are aligned, not adverse, in relation to the primary purpose of the litigation is corroborated by the fact that the City filed a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*560</span> cross-claim to recover the costs of abating nuisances at several of the properties at issue. Should CHRP ultimately prevail and obtain injunctive relief, Deutsche Bank will be enjoined from engaging in similar conduct with respect to similar properties in the Cleveland area, potentially sparing the City the costs of future nuisance abatement.</p>\n<p>CHRP does not directly challenge this characterization of the primary controversy between the parties, but argues that the parties' common interests in abating the complained of nuisance conditions are insufficient reason to re-align the parties. Yet, the potentially adverse interests represented by the City's liens on some of the properties are clearly \"ancillary\" or \"secondary\" to the primary controversy. To find error in the district court's realignment of the parties, we would have to disregard the teaching of <i>Thomas Solvent</i> and <i>Indianapolis v. Chase Nat'l Bank.</i> This we are unwilling to do. Accordingly, we hold that the district court properly realigned the City as a plaintiff and properly held there is complete diversity between the parties for purposes of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. <i>Amount in Controversy</i>\n</h2>\n<p>CHRP also challenges the district court's finding that the amount-in-controversy requirement for diversity jurisdiction is met. \"In actions seeking declaratory or injunctive relief, it is well established that the amount in controversy is measured by the value of the object of the litigation.\" <i>Hunt v. Wash. State Apple Adver. Comm'n,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109703\"><a href=\"/opinion/109703/hunt-v-washington-state-apple-advertising-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">432</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">333</span></a></span>, 347, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109703\"><a href=\"/opinion/109703/hunt-v-washington-state-apple-advertising-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">383</span></a></span> (1977). Additionally, we have observed that the \"costs of complying with an injunction ... may establish the amount-in-controversy.\" <i>Everett v. Verizon Wireless, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"795448\"><a href=\"/opinion/795448/tom-everett-v-verizon-wireless-inc-dobson-cellular-systems-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">460</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">818</span></a></span>, 829 (6th Cir.2006). Deutsche Bank has the burden of showing that the requirement \"more likely than not\" is satisfied. <i>Everett,</i> 460 F.3d at 822.</p>\n<p>The district court was persuaded by Deutsche Bank's showing that injunctive relief requiring it to abate the alleged nuisances or demolish the twenty-five residential properties and requiring it to alter its business practices would result in costs to Deutsche Bank in excess of $75,000. <i>Cleveland Housing,</i> 606 F.Supp.2d at 711. Again, CHRP does not directly challenge the district court's finding, but argues that the amount in controversy should be determined from its viewpoint, rather than Deutsche Bank's. CHRP does not explain what the value of injunctive relief would be or how the value of such relief should be assessed, but asserts simply that the value of the relief is less than $75,000.</p>\n<p>While the value of the requested injunctive relief to CHRP may be difficult to quantify, the notion that abatement of nuisances on twenty-five parcels of abandoned property would amount to improvement valued at less than $75,000 is patently suspect. CHRP seeks to have twenty-five properties declared public nuisances and require the defendants to abate each nuisance, which may include, according to the complaint, replacement of the home's assets, such as copper or aluminum, repairing or replacing doors and windows, and repairing vandalism damage. As an alternative to abating the twenty-five properties at issue in this litigation, CHRP seeks to have the properties demolished.</p>\n<p>Deutsche Bank has satisfactorily shown that it is \"more likely than not\" that the amount-in-controversy requirement is met. The district court recognized that the Cuyahoga County Auditor's valuation of the twenty-five properties at a total of more than $1.3 million is likely inflated, but correctly concluded that potential demolition of even just several properties would likely <span class=\"star-pagination\">*561</span> result in costs exceeding $75,000. <i>Id.</i> Indeed, common sense dictates that the significant remedial measures or complete destruction of the properties CHRP seeks would certainly cost, on average, in excess of $3,000 per structure. In its rather perfunctory challenge to the district court's amount-in-controversy determination, CHRP has failed to show error.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, we hold that the district court properly satisfied itself of its subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1332.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. Article III Standing</h2>\n<p>Even if subject matter jurisdiction is established, CHRP maintains that remand to state court is warranted on the ground that it lacks standing to proceed with its claims in federal court. The district court overruled the objection, holding that CHRP does have standing. The district court correctly identified and applied the three constitutional standing requirements: (1) injury in fact, (2) traceable to the defendant's challenged actions, (3) which is redressable by a favorable decision. <i>Cleveland Housing,</i> 606 F.Supp.2d at 705 (citing <i>Friends of the Earth, Inc. v.

In <i>Quackenbush,</i> the Court observed that <i>Burford</i> abstention is a matter of equitable discretion reflecting principles of federalism and comity and requiring the balancing of federal interests in retaining jurisdiction against the competing concern for the independence of state action:</p>\n<blockquote>The equitable decision balances the <i>strong federal interest</i> in having certain classes of cases, and certain federal rights, adjudicated in federal court, against the State's interests in maintaining uniformity in the treatment of an essentially local problem, and retaining local control over difficult questions of state law bearing on policy problems of substantial public import. This balance only <i>rarely</i> favors abstention, and the power to dismiss recognized in <i>Burford</i> represents an <i>extraordinary</i> and <i>narrow</i> exception to the duty of the District Court to adjudicate a controversy properly before it.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Quackenbush,</i> 517 U.S. at 728, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118031\"><a href=\"/opinion/118031/quackenbush-v-allstate-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1712</span></a></span> (citations and quotation marks omitted; emphasis added). The <i>Quackenbush</i> Court noted that its overruling of abstention in <i>NOPSI</i> represented a recent application of these principles in relation to a claim of federal preemption of state administrative proceedings, illustrating the narrow range of circumstances in which <i>Burford</i> abstention may be justified. <i>Id.</i> at 726, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118031\"><a href=\"/opinion/118031/quackenbush-v-allstate-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1712</span></a></span>. The Court characterized the <i>NOPSI</i> ruling as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>We thus indicated that <i>Burford</i> allows a federal court to dismiss a case only if it presents \"`difficult questions of state law bearing on policy problems of substantial public import whose importance transcends the result in the case then at bar,'\" or if its adjudication in a federal forum \"`would be disruptive of state efforts to establish a coherent policy with respect to a matter of substantial public concern.'\"</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 726-27, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118031\"><a href=\"/opinion/118031/quackenbush-v-allstate-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Because <i>Burford</i> abstention is concerned with potential disruption of a state regulatory scheme, \"[t]he key question is whether an erroneous federal court decision could impair the state's effort to implement its policy.\" <i>Id.</i> at 626 (quoting <i>Ada-Cascade Watch Co., Inc. v. Cascade Res. Recovery, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"427032\"><a href=\"/opinion/427032/ada-cascade-watch-co-inc-a-michigan-non-profit-corporation-foremost/\"><span class=\"volume\">720</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">897</span></a></span>, 903 (6th Cir.1983)).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. <i>Federal Interests</i>\n</h2>\n<p>First, we examine the federal interests. The instant action, removed based on the parties' diversity, falls within one of those \"classes of cases\" to which a \"strong federal interest\" attaches. <i>Quackenbush,</i> 517 U.S. at 728, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118031\"><a href=\"/opinion/118031/quackenbush-v-allstate-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1712</span></a></span>. Unlike <i>Quackenbush,</i> which involved the Federal Arbitration Act, and <i>NOPSI,</i> which presented a question of federal preemption, no federal statute or federal right is implicated in this case. CHRP's complaint is premised exclusively on Ohio state law. There is, however, a strong federal interest in adjudicating cases brought under the congressional grant of diversity jurisdiction:</p>\n<blockquote>By conferring jurisdiction on the federal courts in diversity cases through 28 U.S.C. § 1332, Congress intended a uniformly administered federal judicial system, which affords litigants of diverse citizenship convenient forums in which to vindicate their rights. Although the basic Congressional purpose behind the grant of diversity jurisdiction was to protect out-of-state suitors <span class=\"star-pagination\">*563</span> from the prejudice of state courts,.... the Congressional purpose was broader. By vesting the federal district courts with equity jurisdiction and guaranteeing adequate appeals within the federal judicial system, Congress afforded procedures and remedies that were not available in the courts of several states.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Miller v. Davis,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"323751\"><a href=\"/opinion/323751/stafford-miller-v-cw-davis-estill-hall-v-cw-davis-clay-d-sellers/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">308</span></a></span>, 316-317 (6th Cir.1974) (footnote, citations omitted).</p>\n<p>The district court was cognizant of the federal interest in diversity jurisdiction, but noted that such interest was \"particularly strong\" in <i>Miller</i> because that case involved a large nationwide pension fund. The district court determined that the federal interest in affording a federal forum for CHRP's complaint is not as strong because no such national concern is presented in this case. <i>Cleveland Housing,</i> 606 F.Supp.2d at 713.</p>\n<p>Deutsche Bank insists there are federal interests in this case beyond the virtues of diversity jurisdiction, noting that Congress has recently appropriated $2 billion for the redevelopment of real estate markets in distress due to foreclosures. Deutsche Bank also points to various governmental organizations and programs designed to address the problem of home foreclosures throughout the country as evidence that this case touches on matters of nationwide import. Indeed, we can take judicial notice of the fact that residential foreclosures represent a nationwide epidemic that has precipitated various governmental remedial measures. Yet, this carries little weight in measuring the federal interests in adjudicating the claims asserted in CHRP's complaint. This action is not addressed to the problems associated with residential foreclosures generally; it is aimed at abating nuisances allegedly caused by Deutsche Bank at twenty-five identified locations in the Cleveland area. The fact that government funds have been appropriated to address the nation's foreclosure crisis does not affect the application of Ohio public nuisance law in relation to the twenty-five properties in Cleveland.</p>\n<p>Nor are we impressed by Deutsche Bank's argument that CHRP's \"broadside attack\" on Deutsche Bank's \"business practices\" could result in imposition of local restrictions on the national operations of federally regulated businesses. The argument hints at the notion of federal preemption, but is based only on potential conflicts too speculative to materially enhance the federal interests weighing against <i>Burford</i> abstention.</p>\n<p>Yet, though unpersuaded by Deutsche Bank's arguments that there are federal interests beyond the virtues of diversity jurisdiction, we believe the district court improperly undervalued the strength of the federal interest in affording a neutral forum for the adjudication of disputes between parties of diverse citizenship. The district court characterized the federal interest based on diversity jurisdiction <i>sans</i> other federal rights as being \"at its nadir.\" <i>Cleveland Housing,</i> 606 F.Supp.2d at 714. The court's implicit conclusion that diversity jurisdiction represents a \"strong\" federal interest only if accompanied by <i>other</i> federal interests is based on a faulty negative inference. In <i>Miller v. Davis</i><i>,</i> as the district court observed, there were, in addition to diversity jurisdiction, other federal interests that helped render abstention inappropriate. Yet this does not compel the conclusion that abstention <i>is</i> appropriate if diversity jurisdiction represents the only strong federal interest. Additional federal interests make an already strong federal interest stronger, but their absence does not render an already strong federal interest weak.</p>\n<p>In our opinion, the importance of diversity jurisdiction is particularly strong in this case, where the state law claims (a) <span class=\"star-pagination\">*564</span> are of intense local concern, (b) are asserted against not just citizens of different states, but affiliates of manifestly \"foreign\" (i.e., German) corporations, and (c) would otherwise be adjudicated by a locally-elected municipal judge. The district court's minimization of the \"strong federal interest\" in affording Deutsche Bank a neutral forum for the adjudication of CHRP's state law claims is a flaw that materially affected its interest-balancing analysis.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. <i>State Interests</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The state interests that may be deemed to outweigh the federal interests must stem from the need to maintain uniformity in the treatment of an essentially local problem, and the need to retain local control over difficult questions of state law bearing on policy problems of substantial public import. <i>Quackenbush,</i> 517 U.S. at 728, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118031\"><a href=\"/opinion/118031/quackenbush-v-allstate-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1712</span></a></span>. The district court noted that the Ohio legislature had expressed a strong interest in the Cleveland housing market by (1) establishing a specialized housing division in the Cleveland Municipal Court with exclusive jurisdiction over statutory public nuisance claims; and (2) authorizing Cuyahoga County (the county surrounding Cleveland) to create a land reutilization corporation for the purpose of promoting reclamation and development and managing of vacant real property. <i>Cleveland Housing,</i> 606 F.Supp.2d at 714-15. Further, with reference to the first <i>NOPSI</i> factor, the district court held that CHRP's common-law public nuisance claim, attacking Deutsche Bank's \"business practices,\" presents a difficult question of state law bearing on policy problems of substantial public import. <i>Id.</i> at 715. As to the second factor, the district court held that federal adjudication of CHRP's statutory public nuisance claim could disrupt state efforts to establish a coherent policy through uniform adjudication of such claims in the specialized housing division of the municipal court. <i>Id.</i> at 715-16.</p>\n<p>Having thus identified two state interests that qualified, per <i>NOPSI,</i> for <i>Quackenbush</i> balancing against the federal interests, the district court gave short shrift to the actual balancing, and summarily concluded that \"a balancing of the respective federal and state interests suggests that this court must abstain.\" <i>Id.</i> at 716, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118031\"><a href=\"/opinion/118031/quackenbush-v-allstate-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1712</span></a></span>. Deutsche Bank challenges this conclusion on several grounds.</p>\n<p>First, Deutsche Bank notes that the <i>NOPSI</i> factors represent cognizable state interests weighing in favor of abstention only \"where timely and adequate state-court review is available.\" <i>NOPSI,</i> 491 U.S. at 361, 109 S.Ct. 2506. Deutsche Bank argues that adequate review is unavailable in the housing division of the Cleveland Municipal Court because the sole judge of the housing court has made numerous public statements evidencing his bias against banks and mortgage companies in relation to nuisance conditions at vacant properties. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p>The statements attributed to the housing court judge do not relate specifically to this litigation or the properties here at issue. While the statements may be construed as raising questions, they do not necessarily reflect adversely on the housing court judge's ability to adjudicate CHRP's claims fairly and impartially. Under Ohio law, the housing court judge is subject to disqualification upon a proper showing, and the judge's rulings are subject to appellate review. For these reasons, the statements identified by Deutsche Bank do not demonstrate that available state-court review is inadequate.</p>\n<p>Next, Deutsche Bank challenges the district court's reliance on the first <i>NOPSI</i> factor as warranting abstention in relation to CHRP's common-law public <span class=\"star-pagination\">*565</span> nuisance claim. Deutsche Bank concedes that CHRP's business practices claim presents a novel claim, but argues it has not been shown to present a \"difficult question.\" The claim that Deutsche Bank's business practices create a public nuisance is based on <i>Cincinnati v. Beretta U.S.A. Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">95</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">416</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">768</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1136</span></span> (2002). In <i>Beretta,</i> the court reversed dismissal of a claim alleging that several gun manufacturers had \"created and maintained a public nuisance by manufacturing, marketing, distributing, and selling firearms in ways that unreasonably interfere with public health, welfare, and safety in Cincinnati.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1141. The <i>Beretta</i> court applied what it called the \"broad language\" of the Restatement definition of \"public nuisance\" as \"an unreasonable interference with a right common to the general public.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1142 (quoting 4 Restatement of the Law 2d, Torts (1965) § 821B(1)). Further, the court defined \"unreasonable interference\" as including \"those acts that significantly interfere with public health, safety, peace, comfort, or convenience, conduct that is contrary to a statute, ordinance, or regulation, or conduct that is of a continuing nature or one which has produced a permanent or long-lasting effect upon the public right, an effect of which the actor is aware or should be aware.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Considering the broad definitions applied by the Ohio Supreme Court in <i>Beretta</i> and the apparent ease with which the court reasoned that the alleged business practices of gun manufacturers, distributors and dealers could come within those definitions, it is not immediately apparent what makes CHRP's business practices claim \"difficult,\" as opposed to merely \"novel.\" In fact, the <i>Beretta</i> court expressly observed that it had \"often applied public nuisance law to actions connected to real property.\" <i>Id.</i> The Ohio common law to be applied, derived from the Restatement, thus appears to be settled, even though the application of the law to Deutsche Bank's alleged \"business practices\" may be novel. A novel question is not necessarily a difficult question; every application of settled law to a particular set of factual allegations is unique or novel in some respects.</p>\n<p>Moreover, even if the claim were deemed to represent a \"difficult question\" of state tort law, it is doubtful that this circumstance alone would justify abstention. <i>Burford</i> abstention is concerned with avoiding \"difficult questions of state law bearing on policy problems of substantial public import whose importance transcends the result in the case at bar\" questions, whose resolution by a federal court \"would be disruptive of state efforts to establish a coherent policy.\" <i>Colorado River Water Conservation Dist. v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109405\"><a href=\"/opinion/109405/colorado-river-water-cons-dist-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">424</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">800</span></a></span>, 814, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109405\"><a href=\"/opinion/109405/colorado-river-water-cons-dist-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">483</span></a></span> (1976). In other words, not just any difficult question will do. Neither party has cited and we are unaware of any authority for the proposition that <i>Burford</i> abstention is appropriate based solely on the finding of a difficult question of state lawi.e., without there also being a risk of disrupting coherent state policy.</p>\n<p>CHRP relies on <i>Minot v. Eckardt-Minot,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"660178\"><a href=\"/opinion/660178/jeffrey-r-minot-and-jeffrey-r-minot-as-the-parent-and-custodian-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">13</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">590</span></a></span> (2d Cir.1994), where, in a diversity action, the court, reviewing for abuse of discretion, upheld abstention in relation to the tort claim of \"custodial interference,\" a \"paradigmatic example\" of a \"difficult question of state law.\" <i>Id.</i> at 593.<sup>[1]</sup> In <i>Minot,</i> due to \"the spectre of local bias,\" the court was wary of using <span class=\"star-pagination\">*566</span> abstention to deny an out-of-state litigant the federal forum she preferred. <i>Id.</i> Yet, the court also noted that New York law in this area was newly developing and recognition of the tort of custodial interference \"would significantly change the landscape of custody disputes.\" <i>Id.</i> at 594. The court noted that \"questions concerning child custody are peculiarly ill-suited for federal court adjudication.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Casaburro v. Daher,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1518824\"><a href=\"/opinion/1518824/casaburro-v-daher/\"><span class=\"volume\">569</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">835</span></a></span>, 836 (S.D.N.Y.1983)). Still, the family law nature of the controversy alone would not have justified abstention if it had presented a simple application of settled law. <i>Id.</i> Rather, it was because the case required \"defining and developing the exact contours of a tort of custodial interference\" in a context of tangled equities that the state law question was deemed \"especially complicated.\" <i>Id.</i> at n. 3. The court thus reasoned that \"[a] state court should lead the way in developing its law in this area, balancing the delicate issues involved here.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Here, in contrast, the Ohio common law of public nuisance is settled. The state law definitions and standards to be applied to CHRP's novel allegations are clear and well-developed. While land use policy is undoubtedly a matter of substantial public concern, <i>see </i><i>Saginaw Housing,</i> 576 F.3d at 628, there is no reason to believe that the federal court's application of settled law to the facts alleged in support of CHRP's common law public nuisance claim would be disruptive of any coherent state policy.<sup>[2]</sup> Accordingly, we conclude the district court erred in holding that the state has a strong interest because the case presents a difficult question of state law.</p>\n<p>Finally, Deutsche Bank also challenges the district court's assessment of the state's interest in adjudication of CHRP's statutory public nuisance claim under the second <i>NOPSI</i> factor. Relying on <i>Saginaw Housing,</i> a decision rendered after the district court issued its abstention ruling, Deutsche Bank contends that Ohio's interest in land use policy and nuisance abatement is not shown to have taken the form of a coherent statewide policy that would be disrupted by federal court adjudication. We agree.</p>\n<p>In <i>Saginaw Housing,</i> the Saginaw Housing Commission sought to enjoin the construction of a halfway house, pursuant to a <i>municipal</i> land use ordinance. Even though the action required interpretation of a local land use ordinance, we reversed the district court's abstention order because there was no evidence that federal involvement would disrupt a coherent state policy. We recognized that both state and local policies were at play, but held that municipalities, unlike states, are not themselves sovereign and are not entitled to the same federal deference that the states receive. <i>Saginaw Housing,</i> 576 F.3d at 626. We acknowledged that the City of Saginaw had implemented the subject ordinance pursuant to state law, the Township Zoning Act. However, the State of Michigan had not created an administrative agency to promulgate and administer and uniformly enforce state policy. Nor had the state, in delegating authority to municipalities under the Township Zoning Act, established substantive standards to guide municipalities in creating and enforcing their own ordinances. <i>Id.</i> at 627. We found that the Township Zoning Act did <span class=\"star-pagination\">*567</span> not \"display any other hallmarks of a complex and uniform approach to land use issues.\" <i>Id.</i> at 628. Thus finding minimal evidence of a coherent state policy that would be disrupted by federal involvement, we held that <i>Burford</i> abstention was inappropriate.</p>\n<p>The <i>Saginaw Housing</i> opinion emphasizes the importance of a threatened disruption of state efforts as integral to interest-balancing and prerequisite to <i>Burford</i> abstention:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<i>Burford</i> abstention often protects \"complex state administrative processes from undue federal interference.\" ... That said, \"it does not require abstention wherever there exists such a process.\"... \"Because <i>Burford</i> abstention is concerned with potential disruption of a state administrative scheme, rather than the mere existence of such a scheme, looking behind the action to determine whether it implicates the concerns of <i>Burford</i> is necessary.\"... \"The key question is whether an erroneous federal court decision could impair the state's effort to implement its policy.\"</blockquote>\n<blockquote>....</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Every case in which we have found <i>Burford</i> abstention appropriate has involved evidence that federal involvement would disrupt a coherent state policy.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 626 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p>Here, Ohio's public nuisance statute, R.C. § 3767.41, evidences greater state concern and involvement in local land use regulation than was presented in <i>Saginaw Housing.</i> The statute includes a definitional section, incorporating federal regulatory standards in relation to federal subsidized housing. It prescribes the nature of the civil action that may be used \"to enforce <i>any</i> local building, housing, air pollution, sanitation, health, fire, zoning, or safety code, ordinance, resolution, or regulation applicable to buildings.\" R.C. § 3767.41(B)(1)(a) (emphasis added). The statute also sets forth procedures relating to injunctive relief, authorization of interested parties to abate a nuisance, and appointment of a receiver. The statute permits the filing of such an action in any appropriate court of common pleas, municipal court, housing or environmental division of a municipal court, or county court.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, here, as in <i>Saginaw Housing,</i> the state did not create and empower an agency to oversee uniform administration and enforcement of a comprehensive statewide regulatory scheme. While the presence of state administrative agency involvement is not prerequisite to <i>Burford</i> abstention, it represents an important indicator of the state's interest in implementing a coherent policy. <i>Saginaw Housing,</i> 576 F.3d at 627. Here, rather, the state has established a general form and procedure for enforcement of predominantly <i>local</i> ordinances and regulations and has delegated authority for their enforcement to any of various courts. As the district court noted, <i>Cleveland Housing,</i> 606 F.Supp.2d at 714, the state legislature has evidenced special interest in the Cleveland and Toledo housing markets by specifically creating a housing division in each city's municipal court and granting it exclusive jurisdiction over public nuisance claims arising within its territory. R.C. §§ 1901.011, 1901.181(A)(1). Yet, this specialized interest in the administration of local building ordinances and regulations in only two of the eighty-eight Ohio counties actually weighs against a finding that there is a coherent <i>statewide</i> policy. That the housing division of the Cleveland Municipal Court may strive for uniformity in its regulation of the housing market within its local territory is not a factor warranting federal court abstention. <i>Saginaw Housing,</i> 576 F.3d at 626.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*568</span> Moreover, here, as in <i>Saginaw Housing,</i> there is precious little showing of just how adjudication of CHRP's statutory public nuisance claim in a federal court in Cleveland, rather than in the municipal court in Cleveland, applying the very same standards, would disrupt or impair state efforts to implement a statewide policy. As <i>Saginaw Housing</i> makes clear, the mere existence of Ohio's statutory scheme is not enough to warrant abstention; there must be a threat of disruption or impairment of the state's efforts to implement a coherent uniform policy. CHRP has not made a strong showing of a coherent statewide policy or a threatened disruption thereof. Indeed, the district court's finding that CHRP <i>did</i> make a sufficient showing is decidedly unconvincing. It consists of one conclusory sentence: \"Federal interference in this local matter may disrupt the state's efforts to have such cases uniformly adjudicated.\" <i>Cleveland Housing,</i> 606 F.Supp.2d at 716. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p>We therefore conclude, in relation to the second <i>NOPSI</i> factor, too, that the district court erred in finding that Ohio has a strong cognizable interest in state court adjudication of CHRP's statutory public nuisance claim.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. <i>Interest Balancing</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Accordingly, we find that the district court undervalued the importance of the federal interest at stake and overvalued the strength of the state interests. Inasmuch as CHRP has failed to demonstrate that its common law public nuisance claim presents a difficult question of state law, and that federal court adjudication of its statutory public nuisance claim threatens to disrupt the state's effort to implement a coherent statewide policy, we hold that the state interests are outweighed by the strong federal interest in affording foreign litigants a neutral forum for the adjudication of state law claims against them. CHRP has failed to show that its complaint presents such extraordinary circumstances as to come within that narrow exception to the exercise of federal jurisdiction represented by <i>Burford</i> abstention.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, we uphold the district court's realignment of the parties to establish complete diversity, as well as its holding that CHRP has standing to proceed on its complaint in federal court. Concluding that <i>Burford</i> abstention is not warranted, however, we VACATE the district court's order remanding the action to the state court, and REMAND the action to the district court for further proceedings on CHRP's complaint.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  The Honorable Joseph M. Hood, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Kentucky, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  Although earlier Sixth Circuit opinions also applied the more deferential abuse-of-discretion standard in reviewing abstention rulings, <i>de novo</i> review is now the rule of this circuit. <i>Saginaw Housing,</i> 576 F.3d at 625 n. 3.</p>\n<p>[2]  We express no opinion, of course, as to the facial validity of CHRP's common law public nuisance claim. In <i>City of Cleveland v. Ameriquest Mort. Securities, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"151594\"><a href=\"/opinion/151594/city-of-cleveland-v-ameriquest-mort-securities/\"><span class=\"volume\">615</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">496</span></a></span> (6th Cir.2010), a case in which the question of abstention was not raised, we affirmed dismissal of an analogous business-practices public nuisance claim for failure to state a claim.</p>\n\n</div>",
