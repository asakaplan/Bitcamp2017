Does a public high school teacher have a First (and\nFourteenth) Amendment right “to select books and methods of instruction for use in the\nclassroom without interference from public officials”? Yes, says the teacher, Shelley\nEvans-Marshall. No, says the Tipp City Board of Education. Because the right to free\nspeech protected by the First Amendment does not extend to the in-class curricular\n\n        *\n        The Honorable Robert H. Cleland, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of\nMichigan, sitting by designation.\n\n\n                                               1\n\fNo. 09-3775        Evans-Marshall v. Bd. of Educ. of the Tipp City                Page 2\n                   Exempted Village Sch. Dist. et al.\n\n\nspeech of teachers in primary and secondary schools made “pursuant to” their official\nduties, Garcetti v. Ceballos, 547 U.S. 410, 421 (2006), we affirm the judgment rejecting\nthis claim as a matter of law.\n\n                                           I.\n\n       In 2000, the Tipp City Board of Education hired Evans-Marshall to teach English\nand to supervise Tippecanoe High School’s literary magazine, BirchBark, for the\n2000–2001 school year. The Board renewed her contract for the 2001–2002 school year,\nwhen Evans-Marshall taught English to 9th and 11th grade students and a creative\nwriting course to 11th and 12th grade students. At the beginning of the fall semester,\nEvans-Marshall assigned Ray Bradbury’s Fahrenheit 451 to her 9th graders. To the end\nof exploring the book’s theme of government censorship, she distributed a list compiled\nby the American Library Association of the “100 Most Frequently Challenged Books.”\nStudents divided into groups, and Evans-Marshall asked each group to pick a book from\nthe list, to investigate the reasons why the book was challenged and to lead an in-class\ndebate about the book. Two groups chose Heather Has Two Mommies by Lesléa\nNewman.\n\n       A parent complained about Heather Has Two Mommies, and the principal,\nCharles Wray, asked Evans-Marshall to tell the students to choose a different book. She\ncomplied, explaining to her class that “they were in a unique position to . . . use this\nexperience as source material for their debate because they were in the . . . position of\nhaving actually experienced censorship in preparing to debate censorship.” R.31-2 at\n342–43. After the class completed the Fahrenheit 451 unit, Evans-Marshall assigned\nSiddhartha by Hermann Hesse and used it as the basis for in-class discussions about\n“spirituality, Buddhism, romantic relationships, personal growth, [and] familial\nrelationships.” R.31-1 at 101.\n\n       At the October 2001 meeting of the school board, twenty-five or so parents\ncomplained about the curricular choices in the schools, including Siddhartha and the\nbook-censorship assignment. The next day, Principal Wray called a meeting of the\n\fNo. 09-3775        Evans-Marshall v. Bd. of Educ. of the Tipp City                Page 3\n                   Exempted Village Sch. Dist. et al.\n\n\nEnglish department and told Evans-Marshall that she was “on the hot seat.” R.31-1 at\n64. Nearly 100 parents, as well as the local news media, attended the board’s November\nmeeting. For over an hour, parents expressed concerns about books in the curriculum\nand in the school libraries. While the parents mentioned many books, they raised\nparticular objections to the materials in Evans-Marshall’s classroom and her teaching\nmethods. Superintendent John Zigler explained that the school board had purchased\nmany of the materials, including Siddhartha, several years before, making it difficult to\ncriticize Evans-Marshall for teaching a book the school board had bought. “You should\nbe embarrassed,” one parent responded, referring to the explicit language and sexual\nthemes in the book. R.46 at 1:32:20. Another parent complained that she had asked for\nan alternative assignment—instead of Siddhartha—and “was given three books,” two\nof which “were for a four-to-eight year old.” R.46 at 1:33:40. “I’m not going to put my\ndaughter through this,” the parent added, explaining that she thought Evans-Marshall\nwas “punish[ing] my daughter.” R.46 at 1:33:40. A group of parents presented the\nboard with a 500-signature petition calling for “decency and excellence” in the\nclassroom. R.46 at 0:29:00, 0:55:00.\n\n       The meeting was not one-sided.           A member of the board—a parent\nhimself—warned that the school district’s policies about potentially objectionable\nmaterial “have to be well thought out because what you might find offensive, I might\nnot.” R.46 at 1:41:40. Another board member reminded the group that, as elected\nofficials, the board “must walk the middle of the road to some extent,” even if the\ncommunity might “err . . . on the conservative side.” R.46 at 0:20:45. And a parent who\nmade a formal statement said that he “[did not] condone” the behavior of some of the\nmore vocal parents and trusted that school officials “want what’s best for our kids.”\nR.46 at 0:22:00.\n\n       The matter did not end there. In teaching creative writing, Evans-Marshall\nmaintained a file of student writing samples that she shared with students who asked for\nadditional guidance on assignments. Running low on copies of some of the samples, she\nsent three of them to support staff to be copied. A member of the copy room staff,\n\fNo. 09-3775        Evans-Marshall v. Bd. of Educ. of the Tipp City               Page 4\n                   Exempted Village Sch. Dist. et al.\n\n\napparently not a friend, showed the writing samples to Wray, saying he “ought to read\nthis.” R.33-1 at 76. After reading the papers, Wray called Evans-Marshall to his office.\nWhen she arrived, he waved two of the writing samples in his hand, one a first-hand\naccount of a rape, the other a story about a young boy who murdered a priest and\ndesecrated a church. “[A]re you going to use these in class after everything that’s\nhappened?” he shouted. R.31-1 at 84. Evans-Marshall explained that the writing\nsamples were not intended for in-class distribution and that she would refrain from\nsharing the papers if he wanted. Wray said that he did not like the materials she was\nusing in her classroom or the themes of her in-class discussions and that he “intended\nto rei[n] it in.” R.41 at 24–25.\n\n       The two soon had another argument in the school library about Evans-Marshall’s\nplans to give a final exam involving group discussions and student self-evaluations.\nEvans-Marshall asked Wray to give her a model exam so she could “give [him] back\nexactly what [he] want[ed],” R.31-1 at 43, prompting Wray to call her a “smart a—,” id.\nat 41–42. The next day, Evans-Marshall complained to Superintendent Zigler about\nWray’s behavior. Zigler told her to meet with Wray after the semester break to work\nthings out and offered to speak with Wray in the meantime. He also said that she should\nfeel free to file a formal grievance if things had not been worked out by January.\n\n       Things did not work out by January. Wray and Evans-Marshall talked, but they\nfell back into the same channels of disagreement. Evans-Marshall asked whether there\nwas anything aside from her curricular decisions that bothered Wray. “I’ll see what\nother issues I can come up with,” Wray responded, “for your evaluation next week.”\nR.31-1 at 52–53. Wray’s evaluations criticized Evans-Marshall’s attitude and demeanor\nas well as her “[u]se of material that is pushing the limits of community standards.”\nR.31-5 at 38–39. Evans-Marshall filed written objections to Wray’s evaluations and a\ngrievance with Superintendent Zigler.\n\n       At its March 2002 meeting, the school board voted unanimously not to renew\nEvans-Marshall’s contract. She requested an explanation, and the school board sent her\n\fNo. 09-3775        Evans-Marshall v. Bd. of Educ. of the Tipp City                Page 5\n                   Exempted Village Sch. Dist. et al.\n\n\na letter on April 9, 2002, saying that her non-renewal was “due to problems with\ncommunication and teamwork.” R.31-6 at 10. At Evans-Marshall’s request, the board\nheld a formal hearing about the employment decision. Principal Wray, Superintendent\nZigler and Evans-Marshall all testified, and the board again voted unanimously not to\nrenew her contract.\n\n       (The alert reader may notice that some of the factual allegations raised in Evans-\nMarshall’s complaint and addressed in our first decision do not appear here. See Evans-\nMarshall v. Bd. of Educ., 428 F.3d 223, 226–27 (6th Cir. 2005) (Evans-Marshall I). The\ndistinction between a Civil Rule 12(b)(6) and a Civil Rule 56 appeal explains the\ndifference. As is often the case, discovery will confirm the accuracy of some allegations\nand disprove others. We recount today only the allegations in the complaint backed up\nby “the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits.”\nFed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(2).)\n\n       In March 2003, Evans-Marshall filed this § 1983 action against the school board,\nWray and Zigler. She alleged that the school board and other defendants had retaliated\nagainst her “curricular and pedagogical choices,” infringing her First Amendment right\n“to select books and methods of instruction for use in the classroom without interference\nfrom public officials.” R.1 ¶¶ 32, 36. The defendants moved to dismiss the complaint\nfor failure to state a claim under Civil Rule 12(b)(6), but the district court held that\nEvans-Marshall had sufficiently alleged a First Amendment violation. We affirmed.\nEvans-Marshall I, 428 F.3d 223.\n\n       After discovery by both sides, the defendants again moved for summary\njudgment, arguing that the Supreme Court’s intervening decision in Garcetti v. Ceballos,\n547 U.S. 410 (2006), and the unrebutted facts gleaned from discovery foreclosed Evans-\nMarshall’s claim. In the alternative, they sought summary judgment on the ground that\nthe school board should prevail under the balancing test announced in Pickering v.\nBoard of Education, 391 U.S. 563, 572–73 (1968), or that there was no causal link\nbetween Evans-Marshall’s curricular choices and the non-renewal of her contract. The\n\fNo. 09-3775        Evans-Marshall v. Bd. of Educ. of the Tipp City               Page 6\n                   Exempted Village Sch. Dist. et al.\n\n\ndistrict court granted the defendants’ summary judgment motion. It declined to apply\nGarcetti to the dispute and held that Evans-Marshall’s teaching methods and curricular\nchoices survived the Pickering balancing test. But it concluded that she had not\nprovided sufficient evidence “link[ing] her teaching” methods and curricular choices to\n“the Board’s decision to not renew her contract.” R.52 at 47.\n\n                                          II.\n\n       This free-speech-retaliation case implicates two competing intuitions. On the\none side, doesn’t a teacher have the First Amendment right to choose her own reading\nassignments, decide how they should be taught and above all be able to teach a unit on\ncensorship without being censored or otherwise retaliated against? On the other side,\ndoesn’t a school board have the final say over what is taught, and how, in the public\nschools for which it is responsible? Who wins depends on which line of legal authority\ncontrols.\n\n                                          A.\n\n       In free-speech retaliation cases arising in the employment context, we ask three\nquestions: Was the individual involved in “constitutionally protected” activity—here\nactivity protected by the free speech clause of the First Amendment? Mt. Healthy City\nSch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274, 287 (1977). Would the employer’s\nconduct discourage individuals of “ordinary firmness” from continuing to do what they\nwere doing? Bloch v. Ribar, 156 F.3d 673, 678 (6th Cir. 1998); see Bart v. Telford, 677\nF.2d 622, 625 (7th Cir. 1982). Was the employee’s exercise of constitutionally protected\nrights “a motivating factor” behind the employer’s conduct? Mt. Healthy, 429 U.S. at\n287. The claimant must win each point to prevail.\n\n       The first question requires some elaboration. Three Supreme Court cases define\nthe contours of the free-speech rights of public employees.\n\n       The “matters of public concern” requirement. The First Amendment protects\nthe speech of employees only when it involves “matters of public concern.” Connick v.\n\fNo. 09-3775         Evans-Marshall v. Bd. of Educ. of the Tipp City                   Page 7\n                    Exempted Village Sch. Dist. et al.\n\n\nMyers, 461 U.S. 138, 143 (1983). In Connick, an assistant district attorney, after\nlearning that her supervisor planned to transfer her, solicited information from her\ncolleagues about the office’s transfer policy, about office morale and about whether\nsupervisors had pressured anyone to participate in political campaigning. Id. at 141.\nWhen the supervisor fired her for refusing to accept the transfer, she sued, alleging\nretaliation against protected speech, namely her initiation of the survey. Id. In rejecting\nher claim, the Court explained that not all employee speech is protected, only speech that\n“fairly [may be] considered as relating to” issues “of political, social, or other concern\nto the community.” Id. at 146. When, by contrast, an employee’s speech does not relate\nto a matter of public concern, public officials enjoy “wide latitude” in responding to it\nwithout “intrusive oversight by the judiciary in the name of the First Amendment.” Id.\n\n        The “balancing” requirement. If the employee establishes that her speech\ntouches “matters of public concern,” a balancing test determines whether the employee\nor the employer wins. See Pickering, 391 U.S. at 568. In Pickering, the Court\nconsidered the claim of a high school teacher whom the principal fired after the teacher\nwrote a letter to the local newspaper, criticizing the school board’s budgetary decisions.\nId. at 564. In resolving the claim, the Court “balance[d] . . . the interests of the teacher,\nas a citizen, in commenting upon matters of public concern” against “the interest of the\nState, as an employer, in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs\nthrough its employees.” Id. at 568. Reasoning that there was no relationship between\nthe contents of the letter and the “proper performance of [the teacher’s] daily duties in\nthe classroom,” the Court ruled for the teacher, concluding that the school board’s\ninterests did not outweigh his desire to “contribute to public debate” like any other\ncitizen. Id. at 572–73.\n\n        The “pursuant to” requirement. In the last case in the trilogy, a prosecutor\nreviewed a private complaint that a police officer’s affidavit used to obtain a search\nwarrant contained several misrepresentations. Garcetti, 547 U.S. at 413–14. After\nconfirming that the affidavit contained serious falsehoods, the prosecutor wrote a memo\nto his superiors about his findings, recommended that the office dismiss the case and\n\fNo. 09-3775        Evans-Marshall v. Bd. of Educ. of the Tipp City                 Page 8\n                   Exempted Village Sch. Dist. et al.\n\n\neventually testified to the same effect at a hearing to suppress the evidence discovered\nduring the search. Id. at 414–15. In the aftermath of these and other actions, the\nprosecutor claimed that the office retaliated against him by transferring him to another\ncourthouse and by denying him a promotion. Id. at 415. In rejecting his free-speech\nclaim, the Court did not deny that the prosecutor’s speech related to a matter of “public\nconcern” under Connick, and it did not take on the lower court’s reasoning that\nPickering balancing favored the employee.          It instead concluded that the First\nAmendment did not apply. “The controlling factor,” the Court reasoned, “is that his\nexpressions were made pursuant to his duties as a calendar deputy,” making the relevant\nspeaker the government entity, not the individual. Id. at 421 (emphasis added). “We\nhold that when public employees make statements pursuant to their official duties, the\nemployees are not speaking as citizens for First Amendment purposes, and the\nConstitution does not insulate their communications from employer discipline.” Id.\n\n                                           B.\n\n       A First Amendment claimant must satisfy each of these requirements: the\nConnick “matter of public concern” requirement, the Pickering “balancing” requirement\nand the Garcetti “pursuant to” requirement. Evans-Marshall clears the first two of these\nhurdles but not the third.\n\n       The content of Evans-Marshall’s speech “relat[ed] to . . . matter[s] of political,\nsocial, or other concern to the community.” Connick, 461 U.S. at 146. A teacher’s\ncurricular speech, we have said on several occasions, ordinarily covers these matters.\nSee Evans-Marshall I, 428 F.3d at 230–31; Cockrel v. Shelby County Sch. Dist., 270\nF.3d 1036, 1052 (6th Cir. 2001); Hardy v. Jefferson Cmty. Coll., 260 F.3d 671, 679 (6th\nCir. 2001). “[T]he essence of a teacher’s role is to prepare students for their place in\nsociety as responsible citizens,” Hardy, 260 F.3d at 679, and the teacher that can do that\nwithout covering topics of public concern is rare indeed, perhaps non-existent. Look no\nfurther than the November 2001 meeting of the school board to confirm the point.\nMembers of the community had a lot to say about the topics discussed in Evans-\n\fNo. 09-3775         Evans-Marshall v. Bd. of Educ. of the Tipp City                  Page 9\n                    Exempted Village Sch. Dist. et al.\n\n\nMarshall’s class, and they went to the school board meeting to say it. That large\nsegments of the community disagreed with Evans-Marshall’s speech—her class\nassignments and teaching methods—is beside the point. The question is whether the\ntopics discussed are “of . . . concern” to the community, Connick, 461 U.S. at 146, not\nwhether the community approved of the teacher’s position on each topic. On this\nsummary-judgment record, Evans-Marshall’s curricular speech passes the Connick\n“matter of public concern” test, as the district court correctly determined.\n\n        Evans-Marshall also satisfies Pickering “balancing”—that her “interests . . . as\na citizen, in commenting upon matters of public concern” through her in-class speech\noutweighed the school board’s “interest . . . as an employer, in promoting the efficiency\nof the public services it performs.” Pickering, 391 U.S. at 568. As the district court\ncorrectly concluded, a legitimate factual dispute exists over whether Evans-Marshall’s\ninterest in teaching Siddhartha (and in making other curricular choices) overshadowed\nany interest the school board might claim in disciplining her for doing so. Although the\nschool board has “the ability to select and require adherence to a . . . stated curriculum,”\nR.52 at 26, the court concluded, its interest in enforcing curricular standards is severely\nundermined if it disciplines a teacher for teaching a book the board “had purchased . . .\nand made . . . available to teachers as an optional text,” id. at 40–41. And although the\ncourt did not find Evans-Marshall’s interest in “select[ing] materials to supplement the\nBoard-chosen textbooks . . . and the methods for teaching” to be compelling, id. at 32,\nthat interest outweighed the school’s near-zero interest in disciplining her for teaching\na book it had purchased, id. at 41. We agree—for many of the same reasons identified\nin Evans-Marshall I. See 428 F.3d at 231–32.\n\n        After addressing the Pickering point, however, the district court concluded that\nEvans-Marshall stumbled over causation. The court did not believe that Evans-Marshall\ncould show that her exercise of free speech rights was “a motivating factor” behind the\nschool board’s conduct. See Mt. Healthy, 429 U.S. at 287. That is a harder point to sell.\nAnd a brief accounting of the evidence and the chronology of events shows why.\n\fNo. 09-3775        Evans-Marshall v. Bd. of Educ. of the Tipp City                Page 10\n                   Exempted Village Sch. Dist. et al.\n\n\n       Before any parents complained about her reading assignments and classroom\ndiscussions, Evans-Marshall had never received a negative performance review. Dozens\nof parents flooded the school board’s November 2001 meeting, and many complained\nabout Evans-Marshall’s teaching. One parent told the school board that it “should be\nembarrassed” about the book she was teaching. R.46 at 1:32:20. Principal Wray\nthereafter told Evans-Marshall that she would have to clear any potentially controversial\nmaterial with him. He later told Evans-Marshall that he “intended to rei[n] . . . in” her\nclassroom discussions. R.41 at 24–25. In December 2001, Evans-Marshall complained\nto Superintendent Zigler about Wray’s behavior. And when the semester resumed in\nJanuary 2002, Wray told Evans-Marshall that he would “see what . . . [he could] come\nup with for [her] evaluations,” R.31-1 at 52–53, after which he gave her negative\nperformance reviews for the first time. Only a short time later, the board voted not to\nrenew her contract. To deny a causal relationship between Evans-Marshall’s speech and\nthe Board’s actions does not come to grips with this sequence of events or with the\nimperative at this stage of the litigation that we draw all inferences in favor of the non-\nmoving party: the teacher. Evans-Marshall satisfies Pickering balancing and has shown\nthat her teaching choices caused the school board to fire her.\n\n       Evans-Marshall, however, cannot overcome Garcetti.             When government\nemployees speak “pursuant to their official duties,” Garcetti teaches that they are “not\nspeaking as citizens for First Amendment purposes.” 547 U.S. at 421. Any dispute over\nthe board’s motivations, Pickering balancing or the “public concerns” of her speech\nunder Connick is beside the point if, as Evans-Marshall does not dispute, she made her\ncurricular and pedagogical choices in connection with her official duties as a teacher.\n\n       In the light cast by Garcetti, it is clear that the First Amendment does not\ngenerally “insulate” Evans-Marshall “from employer discipline,” Garcetti, 547 U.S. at\n421, even discipline prompted by her curricular and pedagogical choices and even if it\notherwise appears (at least on summary judgment) that the school administrators treated\nher shabbily. When a teacher teaches, “the school system does not ‘regulate’ [that]\nspeech as much as it hires that speech. Expression is a teacher’s stock in trade, the\n\fNo. 09-3775        Evans-Marshall v. Bd. of Educ. of the Tipp City                Page 11\n                   Exempted Village Sch. Dist. et al.\n\n\ncommodity she sells to her employer in exchange for a salary.” Mayer v. Monroe\nCounty Cmty. Sch. Corp., 474 F.3d 477, 479 (7th Cir. 2007). And if it is the school\nboard that hires that speech, it can surely “regulate the content of what is or is not\nexpressed,” Rosenberger v. Rector & Visitors of the Univ. of Va., 515 U.S. 819, 833\n(1995), what is expressed in other words on its behalf. Only the school board has\nultimate responsibility for what goes on in the classroom, legitimately giving it a say\nover what teachers may (or may not) teach in the classroom.\n\n       It is true that teachers, like students, do not “shed their constitutional rights to\nfreedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate.” Tinker v. Des Moines Indep.\nCmty. Sch. Dist., 393 U.S. 503, 506 (1969). But that does not transform them into the\nemployee and employer when it comes to deciding what, when and how English is\ntaught to fifteen-year-old students. Consider the difference between the speech of\nEvans-Marshall and Marvin Pickering, teachers both. When Pickering sent a letter to\nthe local newspaper criticizing the school board, he said something that any citizen has\na right to say, and he did it on his own time and in his own name, not on the school’s\ntime or in its name. Yet when Evans-Marshall taught 9th grade English, she did\nsomething she was hired (and paid) to do, something she could not have done but for the\nBoard’s decision to hire her as a public school teacher. As with any other individual in\nthe community, she had no more free-speech right to dictate the school’s curriculum than\nshe had to obtain a platform—a teaching position—in the first instance for\ncommunicating her preferred list of books and teaching methods. “[N]o relevant\nanalogue” exists between her in-class curricular speech and speech by private citizens.\nGarcetti, 547 U.S. at 424.\n\n       Teachers are not everyday citizens, Evans-Marshall insists, and they have a right\n“to select books and methods of instruction for use in the classroom without interference\nfrom public officials.” R.1 ¶ 32. But that is not what Ohio law provides or the First\nAmendment requires. Start with Ohio law. Under it, “[t]he board of education of each\ncity . . . shall prescribe a curriculum.” O.R.C. § 3313.60(A). State law gives elected\nofficials—the school board—not teachers, not the chair of a department, not the\n\fNo. 09-3775         Evans-Marshall v. Bd. of Educ. of the Tipp City                 Page 12\n                    Exempted Village Sch. Dist. et al.\n\n\nprincipal, not even the superintendent, responsibility over the curriculum. This is an\naccountability measure, pure and simple, one that ensures the citizens of a community\nhave a say over a matter of considerable importance to many of them—their children’s\neducation—by giving them control over membership on the board.\n\n        The First Amendment does not ban this policy choice or this accountability\nmeasure. The Constitution does not prohibit a State from creating elected school boards\nand from placing responsibility for the curriculum of each school district in the hands\nof each board. Teachers no doubt are “required . . . to speak or write” and otherwise\nexpress themselves, Garcetti, 547 U.S. at 422, but this does not make them “sovereign[s]\nunto [themselves],” Parate v. Isibor, 868 F.2d 821, 827 (6th Cir. 1989). “The curricular\nchoices of the schools should be presumptively their own—the fact that such choices\narouse deep feelings argues strongly for democratic means of reaching them.” Boring\nv. Buncombe County Bd. of Educ., 136 F.3d 364, 371–72 (4th Cir. 1998) (en banc)\n(Wilkinson, C.J., concurring).\n\n        How at any rate would a contrary approach work? If one teacher, Evans-\nMarshall, has a First Amendment right “to select books and methods of instruction for\nuse in the classroom,” R.1 ¶ 32, so presumably do other teachers. Evans-Marshall may\nwish to teach Siddhartha in the first unit of the school year in a certain way, but the chair\nof the English department may wish to use the limited time in a school year to teach A\nTale of Two Cities at that stage of the year. Maybe the head of the upper school has\nsomething else in mind. When educators disagree over what should be assigned, as is\nsurely bound to happen if each of them has a First Amendment right to influence the\ncurriculum, whose free-speech rights win? Why indeed doesn’t the principal, Wray,\nhave a right to defend the discharge on the ground that he was merely exercising his First\nAmendment rights in rejecting Evans-Marshall’s curricular choices and methods of\nteaching? Placing the First Amendment’s stamp of approval on these kinds of debates\nnot only would “demand permanent judicial intervention in the conduct of governmental\noperations,” Garcetti, 547 U.S. at 423, but it also would transform run-of-the-mine\ncurricular disputes into constitutional stalemates.\n\fNo. 09-3775        Evans-Marshall v. Bd. of Educ. of the Tipp City                Page 13\n                   Exempted Village Sch. Dist. et al.\n\n\n       That is not the only problem. What employer discipline arising from an\nemployee’s manner of teaching—choices of books and the methods of teaching\nthem—does not implicate speech? Could a teacher respond to a principal’s insistence\nthat she discuss certain materials by claiming that it improperly compels speech? Cf. W.\nVa. State Bd. of Educ. v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624 (1943). Could a teacher continue to\nassign materials that members of the community perceive as racially insensitive even\nafter the principal tells her not to? Could a teacher raise a controversial topic (say, the\nvirtues of one theory of government over another or the virtues of intelligent design)\nafter a principal has told her not to? Could a teacher introduce mature sexual themes to\nfifteen year olds when discussing a work of literature after a principal has told her not\nto? And “[d]oes a music teacher retain veto power over that most controversial of school\nproductions—the Holiday Concert?” Evans-Marshall I, 428 F.3d at 237–38 (Sutton, J.,\nconcurring).\n\n       Because “one man’s vulgarity is another’s lyric,” Cohen v. California, 403 U.S.\n15, 25 (1971), or, as one school board member put the point at the November 2001\nmeeting, “what you might find offensive, I might not,” R.46 at 1:41:40, parents long\nhave demanded that school boards control the curriculum and the ways of teaching it to\ntheir impressionable children. Permitting federal courts to distinguish classroom\nvulgarities from lyrics or to pick sides on how to teach Siddhartha not only is a recipe\nfor disenfranchising the 9,000 or so members of the Tipp City community but also tests\njudicial competence. “If even the most happily married parents cannot agree on what\nand how their own children should be taught, as [we] suspect is not infrequently the case,\nwhat leads anyone to think the federal judiciary can answer these questions?” Evans-\nMarshall I, 428 F.3d at 237–38 (Sutton, J., concurring).\n\n       The key insight of Garcetti is that the First Amendment has nothing to say about\nthese kinds of decisions. An employee does not lose “any liberties the employee might\nhave enjoyed as a private citizen” by signing on to work for the government, but by the\nsame token, the government, just like a private employer, retains “control over what the\nemployer itself has commissioned or created”: the employee’s job. Garcetti, 547 U.S.\n\fNo. 09-3775         Evans-Marshall v. Bd. of Educ. of the Tipp City                Page 14\n                    Exempted Village Sch. Dist. et al.\n\n\nat 422. And that insight has particular resonance in the context of public education.\nEvery child in Ohio must attend school, see O.R.C. § 3321.02, providing public school\nteachers with a captive audience for their in-class speech, see Mayer, 474 F.3d at 479,\nand providing a compelling reason for putting curricular choices in the hands of\n“someone [they] can vote out of office,” id. at 479–80, or who is otherwise\ndemocratically accountable, see O.R.C. § 3311.71 (elected officials and other\ncommunity institutions appoint school board members in certain municipal school\ndistricts).\n\n        In concluding that the First Amendment does not protect primary and secondary\nschool teachers’ in-class curricular speech, we have considerable company. The Seventh\nCircuit invoked Garcetti in concluding that the curricular and pedagogical choices of\nprimary and secondary school teachers exceed the reach of the First Amendment.\nMayer, 474 F.3d at 480. The Fourth Circuit has not applied Garcetti to teachers’ in-class\nspeech, see Lee v. York County Sch. Div., 484 F.3d 687, 694 n.11 (4th Cir. 2007), and\nis sometimes cited as creating a division among the circuits, see, e.g., Gorum v. Sessoms,\n561 F.3d 179, 186 n.6 (3d Cir. 2009). But that is because the Fourth Circuit disposed\nof the teacher’s retaliation claim based on pre-Garcetti precedent, namely Connick,\nholding that “speech that occurs within a compulsory classroom setting” “does not\nconstitute speech on a matter of public concern” when it is “curricular in nature.”\n484 F.3d at 695, 697. The Fourth Circuit’s approach changes nothing here: A teacher’s\ncurricular and pedagogical choices are categorically unprotected, whether under Connick\nor Garcetti.\n\n        The Third Circuit also has declined to resolve the applicability of Garcetti to this\nsort of speech, see Borden v. Sch. Dist. of Twp. of E. Brunswick, 523 F.3d 153, 171 n.13\n(3d Cir. 2008), but that too makes no difference. Its pre-Garcetti cases hold that,\n“although [a teacher] has a right to advocate outside of the classroom for the use of\ncertain curriculum materials, he does not have a right to use those materials in the\nclassroom.” Edwards v. Cal. Univ. of Pa., 156 F.3d 488, 491 (3d Cir. 1998) (Alito, J.).\nThe Tenth Circuit has applied Garcetti to a school teacher’s speech about curriculum\n\fNo. 09-3775         Evans-Marshall v. Bd. of Educ. of the Tipp City               Page 15\n                    Exempted Village Sch. Dist. et al.\n\n\nand pedagogy, even when made outside the classroom, see Brammer-Hoelter v. Twin\nPeaks Charter Acad., 492 F.3d 1192, 1204 (10th Cir. 2007), but has not addressed in-\nclass curricular speech. The Second Circuit determined, in an unpublished decision, that\nit need not resolve whether a teacher’s in-class speech is governed by Garcetti or by its\nearlier cases applying the “reasonably related to legitimate pedagogical concerns”\nstandard of Hazelwood School District v. Kuhlmeier, 484 U.S. 260, 273 (1988). See\nPanse v. Eastwood, 303 F. App’x 933, 935 (2d Cir. 2008). Other courts of appeals,\nincluding this one, have applied Garcetti in rejecting school employees’ speech claims,\nthough not in the context of curricular and pedagogical choices. See, e.g., Fox v.\nTraverse City Area Pub. Sch. Bd. of Educ., 605 F.3d 345, 349 (6th Cir. 2010); Williams\nv. Dallas Indep. Sch. Dist., 480 F.3d 689, 694 (5th Cir. 2007); Gilder-Lucas v. Elmore\nCounty Bd. of Educ., 186 F. App’x 885, 887 (11th Cir. 2006). The common thread\nthrough all of these cases is that, when it comes to in-class curricular speech at the\nprimary or secondary school level, no other court of appeals has held that such speech\nis protected by the First Amendment.\n\n         Our decision also respects Sixth Circuit authority. In Cockrel and in our initial\ndecision in this case, we held that a school teacher’s curricular and pedagogical choices\n(1) are “speech,” (2) touch on “matters of public concern” and (3) may satisfy Pickering\nbalancing depending on the circumstances developed in discovery or at trial. We do not\ndisturb those holdings and indeed have ruled for the plaintiff on each one of these points\ntoday.\n\n         Not one of these Sixth Circuit cases, however, addressed whether in-class\ncurricular speech survives the threshold inquiry announced in Garcetti: whether the\nspeech was “pursuant to” the claimant’s official duties. 547 U.S. at 421. How could\nthey? Garcetti came down after both decisions and established a new threshold\nrequirement in this area. Evans-Marshall’s failure to satisfy this requirement governs\nus here. “[A] plaintiff may not run home before she reaches first base.” Weathers v.\nLafayette Parish Sch. Bd., 520 F. Supp. 2d 827, 837 (W.D. La. 2007).\n\fNo. 09-3775        Evans-Marshall v. Bd. of Educ. of the Tipp City                Page 16\n                   Exempted Village Sch. Dist. et al.\n\n\n       Nor can Evans-Marshall sidestep this conclusion on the theory that Garcetti does\nnot apply. In his dissent in Garcetti, as Evans-Marshall points out, Justice Souter raised\nconcerns about the applicability of the decision to “academic freedom in public colleges\nand universities.” 547 U.S. at 438 (Souter, J., dissenting). The majority disclaimed any\nintent to resolve the point. See id. at 425 (majority opinion) (“Justice Souter suggests\ntoday’s decision may have important ramifications for academic freedom . . . . We need\nnot, and for that reason do not, decide whether the analysis we conduct today would\napply in the same manner to a case involving speech related to scholarship or\nteaching.”).\n\n       Garcetti’s caveat offers no refuge to Evans-Marshall. She is not a teacher at a\n“public college[]” or “universit[y]” and thus falls outside of the group the dissent wished\nto protect. The concept of “academic freedom,” moreover, does not readily apply to in-\nclass curricular speech at the high school level. As a cultural and a legal principle,\nacademic freedom “was conceived and implemented in the university” out of concern\nfor “teachers who are also researchers or scholars—work not generally expected of\nelementary and secondary school teachers.” J. Peter Byrne, Academic Freedom: A\n“Special Concern of the First Amendment”, 99 Yale L.J. 251, 288 n.137 (1989).\n“[U]niversities occupy a special niche in our constitutional tradition” and the\nconstitutional rules applicable in higher education do not necessarily apply in primary\nand secondary schools, where students generally do not choose whether or where they\nwill attend school. Parents Involved in Cmty. Sch. v. Seattle Sch. Dist. No. 1, 551 U.S.\n701, 724–25 (2007).\n\n       Even to the extent academic freedom, as a constitutional rule, could somehow\napply to primary and secondary schools, that does not insulate a teacher’s curricular and\npedagogical choices from the school board’s oversight, as opposed to the teacher’s right\nto speak and write publicly about academic issues outside of the classroom. “[I]t is the\neducational institution that has a right to academic freedom, not the individual teacher.”\nBorden, 523 F.3d at 172 n.14. Academic freedom implicates “[t]he freedom of a\nuniversity to make its own judgments as to education,” Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke,\n\fNo. 09-3775         Evans-Marshall v. Bd. of Educ. of the Tipp City                 Page 17\n                    Exempted Village Sch. Dist. et al.\n\n\n438 U.S. 265, 312 (1978) (opinion of Powell, J.), requiring “deference to a university’s\nacademic decisions,” Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 306, 328 (2003). See Sweezy v. New\nHampshire, 354 U.S. 234, 263 (1957) (Frankfurter, J., concurring). In the context of in-\nclass curricular speech, this court has already said in the university arena that a teacher’s\ninvocation of academic freedom does not warrant judicial intrusion upon an educational\ninstitution’s decisions: “The First Amendment concept of academic freedom does not\nrequire that a nontenured professor be made a sovereign unto himself.” Parate, 868 F.2d\nat 827. A school “may constitutionally choose not to renew the contract of a nontenured\nprofessor” when that professor’s “pedagogical attitude and teaching methods do not\nconform to institutional standards.” Id. Just so here.\n\n                                            III.\n\n        For these reasons, we affirm the judgment of the district court.\n\f",

Shelley Evans-Marshall, Humble, Texas, pro se.</p>\n<p>Before: SILER and SUTTON, Circuit Judges; CLELAND, District Judge.<sup>[*]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>OPINION</h2>\n<p>SUTTON, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>Does a public high school teacher have a First (and Fourteenth) Amendment right \"to select books and methods of instruction for use in the classroom without interference from public officials\"? Yes, says the teacher, Shelley Evans-Marshall. No, says the Tipp City Board of Education. Because the right to free speech protected by the First Amendment does not extend to the in-class curricular speech of teachers in primary and secondary schools made \"pursuant to\" their official duties, <i>Garcetti v. Ceballos,</i> 547 U.S. 410, 421, 126 S.Ct. 1951, 164 L.Ed.2d 689 (2006), we affirm the judgment rejecting this claim as a matter of law.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>In 2000, the Tipp City Board of Education hired Evans-Marshall to teach English and to supervise Tippecanoe High School's literary magazine, BirchBark, for the 2000-2001 school year. The Board renewed her contract for the 2001-2002 school year, when Evans-Marshall taught English to 9th and 11th grade students and a creative writing course to 11th and 12th grade students. At the beginning of the fall semester, Evans-Marshall assigned Ray Bradbury's <i>Fahrenheit 451</i> to her 9th graders. To the end of exploring the book's theme of government censorship, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*335</span> she distributed a list compiled by the American Library Association of the \"100 Most Frequently Challenged Books.\" Students divided into groups, and Evans-Marshall asked each group to pick a book from the list, to investigate the reasons why the book was challenged and to lead an in-class debate about the book. Two groups chose <i>Heather Has Two Mommies</i> by Lesléa Newman.</p>\n<p>A parent complained about <i>Heather Has Two Mommies,</i> and the principal, Charles Wray, asked Evans-Marshall to tell the students to choose a different book. She complied, explaining to her class that \"they were in a unique position to ... use this experience as source material for their debate because they were in the ... position of having actually experienced censorship in preparing to debate censorship.\" R.31-2 at 342-43. After the class completed the <i>Fahrenheit 451</i> unit, Evans-Marshall assigned <i>Siddhartha</i> by Hermann Hesse and used it as the basis for in-class discussions about \"spirituality, Buddhism, romantic relationships, personal growth, [and] familial relationships.\" R.31-1 at 101.</p>\n<p>At the October 2001 meeting of the school board, twenty-five or so parents complained about the curricular choices in the schools, including <i>Siddhartha</i> and the book-censorship assignment. The next day, Principal Wray called a meeting of the English department and told Evans-Marshall that she was \"on the hot seat.\" R.31-1 at 64. Nearly 100 parents, as well as the local news media, attended the board's November meeting. For over an hour, parents expressed concerns about books in the curriculum and in the school libraries. While the parents mentioned many books, they raised particular objections to the materials in Evans-Marshall's classroom and her teaching methods. Superintendent John Zigler explained that the school board had purchased many of the materials, including <i>Siddhartha,</i> several years before, making it difficult to criticize Evans-Marshall for teaching a book the school board had bought. \"You should be embarrassed,\" one parent responded, referring to the explicit language and sexual themes in the book. R.46 at 1:32:20. Another parent complained that she had asked for an alternative assignmentinstead of <i>Siddhartha</i>and \"was given three books,\" two of which \"were for a four-to-eight year old.\" R.46 at 1:33:40. \"I'm not going to put my daughter through this,\" the parent added, explaining that she thought Evans-Marshall was \"punish[ing] my daughter.\" R.46 at 1:33:40. A group of parents presented the board with a 500-signature petition calling for \"decency and excellence\" in the classroom. R.46 at 0:29:00, 0:55:00.</p>\n<p>The meeting was not one-sided. A member of the boarda parent himself warned that the school district's policies about potentially objectionable material \"have to be well thought out because what you might find offensive, I might not.\" R.46 at 1:41:40. Another board member reminded the group that, as elected officials, the board \"must walk the middle of the road to some extent,\" even if the community might \"err ... on the conservative side.\" R.46 at 0:20:45. And a parent who made a formal statement said that he \"[did not] condone\" the behavior of some of the more vocal parents and trusted that school officials \"want what's best for our kids.\" R.46 at 0:22:00.</p>\n<p>The matter did not end there. In teaching creative writing, Evans-Marshall maintained a file of student writing samples that she shared with students who asked for additional guidance on assignments. Running low on copies of some of the samples, she sent three of them to support staff to be copied. A member of the copy room staff, apparently not a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*336</span> friend, showed the writing samples to Wray, saying he \"ought to read this.\" R.33-1 at 76. After reading the papers, Wray called Evans-Marshall to his office. When she arrived, he waved two of the writing samples in his hand, one a first-hand account of a rape, the other a story about a young boy who murdered a priest and desecrated a church. \"[A]re you going to use these in class after everything that's happened?\" he shouted. R.31-1 at 84. Evans-Marshall explained that the writing samples were not intended for in-class distribution and that she would refrain from sharing the papers if he wanted. Wray said that he did not like the materials she was using in her classroom or the themes of her in-class discussions and that he \"intended to rei[n] it in.\" R.41 at 24-25.</p>\n<p>The two soon had another argument in the school library about Evans-Marshall's plans to give a final exam involving group discussions and student self-evaluations. Evans-Marshall asked Wray to give her a model exam so she could \"give [him] back exactly what [he] want[ed],\" R.31-1 at 43, prompting Wray to call her a \"smart a,\" <i>id.</i> at 41-42. The next day, Evans-Marshall complained to Superintendent Zigler about Wray's behavior. Zigler told her to meet with Wray after the semester break to work things out and offered to speak with Wray in the meantime. He also said that she should feel free to file a formal grievance if things had not been worked out by January.</p>\n<p>Things did not work out by January. Wray and Evans-Marshall talked, but they fell back into the same channels of disagreement. Evans-Marshall asked whether there was anything aside from her curricular decisions that bothered Wray. \"I'll see what other issues I can come up with,\" Wray responded, \"for your evaluation next week.\" R.31-1 at 52-53. Wray's evaluations criticized Evans-Marshall's attitude and demeanor as well as her \"[u]se of material that is pushing the limits of community standards.\" R.31-5 at 38-39. Evans-Marshall filed written objections to Wray's evaluations and a grievance with Superintendent Zigler.</p>\n<p>At its March 2002 meeting, the school board voted unanimously not to renew Evans-Marshall's contract. She requested an explanation, and the school board sent her a letter on April 9, 2002, saying that her non-renewal was \"due to problems with communication and teamwork.\" R.31-6 at 10. At Evans-Marshall's request, the board held a formal hearing about the employment decision. Principal Wray, Superintendent Zigler and Evans-Marshall all testified, and the board again voted unanimously not to renew her contract.</p>\n<p>(The alert reader may notice that some of the factual allegations raised in Evans-Marshall's complaint and addressed in our first decision do not appear here. <i>See </i><i>Evans-Marshall v. Bd. of Educ.,</i> 428 F.3d 223, 226-27 (6th Cir.2005) (<i>Evans-Marshall I</i>). The distinction between a Civil Rule 12(b)(6) and a Civil Rule 56 appeal explains the difference. As is often the case, discovery will confirm the accuracy of some allegations and disprove others. We recount today only the allegations in the complaint backed up by \"the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c)(2).)</p>\n<p>In March 2003, Evans-Marshall filed this § 1983 action against the school board, Wray and Zigler. She alleged that the school board and other defendants had retaliated against her \"curricular and pedagogical choices,\" infringing her First Amendment right \"to select books and methods of instruction for use in the classroom without interference from public officials.\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*337</span> R.1 ¶¶ 32, 36. The defendants moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim under Civil Rule 12(b)(6), but the district court held that Evans-Marshall had sufficiently alleged a First Amendment violation. We affirmed. <i>Evans-Marshall I,</i> 428 F.3d 223.</p>\n<p>After discovery by both sides, the defendants again moved for summary judgment, arguing that the Supreme Court's intervening decision in <i>Garcetti v. Ceballos,</i> 547 U.S. 410, 126 S.Ct. 1951, 164 L.Ed.2d 689 (2006), and the unrebutted facts gleaned from discovery foreclosed Evans-Marshall's claim. In the alternative, they sought summary judgment on the ground that the school board should prevail under the balancing test announced in <i>Pickering v. Board of Education,</i> 391 U.S. 563, 572-73, 88 S.Ct. 1731, 20 L.Ed.2d 811 (1968), or that there was no causal link between Evans-Marshall's curricular choices and the non-renewal of her contract. The district court granted the defendants' summary judgment motion. It declined to apply <i>Garcetti</i> to the dispute and held that Evans-Marshall's teaching methods and curricular choices survived the <i>Pickering</i> balancing test. But it concluded that she had not provided sufficient evidence \"link[ing] her teaching\" methods and curricular choices to \"the Board's decision to not renew her contract.\" R.52 at 47.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>This free-speech-retaliation case implicates two competing intuitions. On the one side, doesn't a teacher have the First Amendment right to choose her own reading assignments, decide how they should be taught and above all be able to teach a unit on censorship without being censored or otherwise retaliated against? On the other side, doesn't a school board have the final say over what is taught, and how, in the public schools for which it is responsible? Who wins depends on which line of legal authority controls.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A.</h2>\n<p>In free-speech retaliation cases arising in the employment context, we ask three questions: Was the individual involved in \"constitutionally protected\" activityhere activity protected by the free speech clause of the First Amendment? <i>Mt. Healthy City Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle,</i> 429 U.S. 274, 287, 97 S.Ct. 568, 50 L.Ed.2d 471 (1977). Would the employer's conduct discourage individuals of \"ordinary firmness\" from continuing to do what they were doing? <i>Bloch v. Ribar,</i> 156 F.3d 673, 678 (6th Cir.1998); <i>see </i><i>Bart v. Telford,</i> 677 F.2d 622, 625 (7th Cir.1982). Was the employee's exercise of constitutionally protected rights \"a motivating factor\" behind the employer's conduct? <i>Mt. Healthy,</i> 429 U.S. at 287, 97 S.Ct. 568. The claimant must win each point to prevail.</p>\n<p>The first question requires some elaboration. Three Supreme Court cases define the contours of the free-speech rights of public employees.</p>\n<p><i>The \"matters of public concern\" requirement.</i> The First Amendment protects the speech of employees only when it involves \"matters of public concern.\" <i>Connick v. Myers,</i> 461 U.S. 138, 143, 103 S.Ct. 1684, 75 L.Ed.2d 708 (1983). In <i>Connick,</i> an assistant district attorney, after learning that her supervisor planned to transfer her, solicited information from her colleagues about the office's transfer policy, about office morale and about whether supervisors had pressured anyone to participate in political campaigning. <i>Id.</i> at 141, 103 S.Ct. 1684. When the supervisor fired her for refusing to accept the transfer, she sued, alleging retaliation against protected speech, namely her initiation of the survey. <i>Id.</i> In rejecting her claim, the Court explained <span class=\"star-pagination\">*338</span> that not all employee speech is protected, only speech that \"fairly [may be] considered as relating to\" issues \"of political, social, or other concern to the community.\" <i>Id.</i> at 146, 103 S.Ct. 1684. When, by contrast, an employee's speech does not relate to a matter of public concern, public officials enjoy \"wide latitude\" in responding to it without \"intrusive oversight by the judiciary in the name of the First Amendment.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p><i>The \"balancing\" requirement.</i> If the employee establishes that her speech touches \"matters of public concern,\" a balancing test determines whether the employee or the employer wins. <i>See </i><i>Pickering,</i> 391 U.S. at 568, 88 S.Ct. 1731. In <i>Pickering,</i> the Court considered the claim of a high school teacher whom the principal fired after the teacher wrote a letter to the local newspaper, criticizing the school board's budgetary decisions. <i>Id.</i> at 564, 88 S.Ct. 1731. In resolving the claim, the Court \"balance[d] ... the interests of the teacher, as a citizen, in commenting upon matters of public concern\" against \"the interest of the State, as an employer, in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees.\" <i>Id.</i> at 568, 88 S.Ct. 1731. Reasoning that there was no relationship between the contents of the letter and the \"proper performance of [the teacher's] daily duties in the classroom,\" the Court ruled for the teacher, concluding that the school board's interests did not outweigh his desire to \"contribute to public debate\" like any other citizen. <i>Id.</i> at 572-73, 88 S.Ct. 1731.</p>\n<p><i>The \"pursuant to\" requirement.</i> In the last case in the trilogy, a prosecutor reviewed a private complaint that a police officer's affidavit used to obtain a search warrant contained several misrepresentations. <i>Garcetti,</i> 547 U.S. at 413-14, 126 S.Ct. 1951. After confirming that the affidavit contained serious falsehoods, the prosecutor wrote a memo to his superiors about his findings, recommended that the office dismiss the case and eventually testified to the same effect at a hearing to suppress the evidence discovered during the search. <i>Id.</i> at 414-15, 126 S.Ct. 1951. In the aftermath of these and other actions, the prosecutor claimed that the office retaliated against him by transferring him to another courthouse and by denying him a promotion. <i>Id.</i> at 415, 126 S.Ct. 1951. In rejecting his free-speech claim, the Court did not deny that the prosecutor's speech related to a matter of \"public concern\" under <i>Connick,</i> and it did not take on the lower court's reasoning that <i>Pickering</i> balancing favored the employee. It instead concluded that the First Amendment did not apply. \"The controlling factor,\" the Court reasoned, \"is that his expressions were made <i>pursuant to</i> his duties as a calendar deputy,\" making the relevant speaker the government entity, not the individual. <i>Id.</i> at 421, 126 S.Ct. 1951 (emphasis added). \"We hold that when public employees make statements pursuant to their official duties, the employees are not speaking as citizens for First Amendment purposes, and the Constitution does not insulate their communications from employer discipline.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B.</h2>\n<p>A First Amendment claimant must satisfy <i>each</i> of these requirements: the <i>Connick</i> \"matter of public concern\" requirement, the <i>Pickering</i> \"balancing\" requirement and the <i>Garcetti</i> \"pursuant to\" requirement. Evans-Marshall clears the first two of these hurdles but not the third.</p>\n<p>The content of Evans-Marshall's speech \"relat[ed] to ... matter[s] of political, social, or other concern to the community.\" <i>Connick,</i> 461 U.S. at 146, 103 S.Ct. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*339</span> 1684. A teacher's curricular speech, we have said on several occasions, ordinarily covers these matters. <i>See </i><i>Evans-Marshall I,</i> 428 F.3d at 230-31; <i>Cockrel v. Shelby County Sch. Dist.,</i> 270 F.3d 1036, 1052 (6th Cir.2001); <i>Hardy v. Jefferson Cmty. Coll.,</i> 260 F.3d 671, 679 (6th Cir. 2001). \"[T]he essence of a teacher's role is to prepare students for their place in society as responsible citizens,\" <i>Hardy,</i> 260 F.3d at 679, and the teacher that can do that <i>without</i> covering topics of public concern is rare indeed, perhaps non-existent. Look no further than the November 2001 meeting of the school board to confirm the point. Members of the community had a lot to say about the topics discussed in Evans-Marshall's class, and they went to the school board meeting to say it. That large segments of the community disagreed with Evans-Marshall's speechher class assignments and teaching methods is beside the point. The question is whether the topics discussed are \"of ... concern\" to the community, <i>Connick,</i> 461 U.S. at 146, 103 S.Ct. 1684, not whether the community approved of the teacher's position on each topic. On this summary-judgment record, Evans-Marshall's curricular speech passes the <i>Connick</i> \"matter of public concern\" test, as the district court correctly determined.</p>\n<p>Evans-Marshall also satisfies <i>Pickering</i> \"balancing\"that her \"interests ... as a citizen, in commenting upon matters of public concern\" through her in-class speech outweighed the school board's \"interest... as an employer, in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs.\" <i>Pickering,</i> 391 U.S. at 568, 88 S.Ct. 1731. As the district court correctly concluded, a legitimate factual dispute exists over whether Evans-Marshall's interest in teaching <i>Siddhartha</i> (and in making other curricular choices) overshadowed any interest the school board might claim in disciplining her for doing so. Although the school board has \"the ability to select and require adherence to a ... stated curriculum,\" R.52 at 26, the court concluded, its interest in enforcing curricular standards is severely undermined if it disciplines a teacher for teaching a book the board \"had purchased ... and made ... available to teachers as an optional text,\" <i>id.</i> at 40-41. And although the court did not find Evans-Marshall's interest in \"select[ing] materials to supplement the Board-chosen textbooks ... and the methods for teaching\" to be compelling, <i>id.</i> at 32, that interest outweighed the school's near-zero interest in disciplining her for teaching a book it had purchased, <i>id.</i> at 41. We agreefor many of the same reasons identified in <i>Evans-Marshall I. See</i> 428 F.3d at 231-32.</p>\n<p>After addressing the <i>Pickering</i> point, however, the district court concluded that Evans-Marshall stumbled over causation. The court did not believe that Evans-Marshall could show that her exercise of free speech rights was \"a motivating factor\" behind the school board's conduct. <i>See </i><i>Mt. Healthy,</i> 429 U.S. at 287, 97 S.Ct. 568. That is a harder point to sell. And a brief accounting of the evidence and the chronology of events shows why.</p>\n<p>Before any parents complained about her reading assignments and classroom discussions, Evans-Marshall had never received a negative performance review. Dozens of parents flooded the school board's November 2001 meeting, and many complained about Evans-Marshall's teaching. One parent told the school board that it \"should be embarrassed\" about the book she was teaching. R.46 at 1:32:20. Principal Wray thereafter told Evans-Marshall that she would have to clear any potentially controversial material with him. He later told Evans-Marshall that he \"intended to rei[n] ... in\" her <span class=\"star-pagination\">*340</span> classroom discussions. R.41 at 24-25. In December 2001, Evans-Marshall complained to Superintendent Zigler about Wray's behavior. And when the semester resumed in January 2002, Wray told Evans-Marshall that he would \"see what ... [he could] come up with for [her] evaluations,\" R.31-1 at 52-53, after which he gave her negative performance reviews for the first time. Only a short time later, the board voted not to renew her contract. To deny a causal relationship between Evans-Marshall's speech and the Board's actions does not come to grips with this sequence of events or with the imperative at this stage of the litigation that we draw all inferences in favor of the non-moving party: the teacher. Evans-Marshall satisfies <i>Pickering</i> balancing and has shown that her teaching choices caused the school board to fire her.</p>\n<p>Evans-Marshall, however, cannot overcome <i>Garcetti.</i> When government employees speak \"pursuant to their official duties,\" <i>Garcetti</i> teaches that they are \"not speaking as citizens for First Amendment purposes.\" 547 U.S. at 421, 126 S.Ct. 1951. Any dispute over the board's motivations, <i>Pickering</i> balancing or the \"public concerns\" of her speech under <i>Connick</i> is beside the point if, as Evans-Marshall does not dispute, she made her curricular and pedagogical choices in connection with her official duties as a teacher.</p>\n<p>In the light cast by <i>Garcetti,</i> it is clear that the First Amendment does not generally \"insulate\" Evans-Marshall \"from employer discipline,\" <i>Garcetti,</i> 547 U.S. at 421, 126 S.Ct. 1951, even discipline prompted by her curricular and pedagogical choices and even if it otherwise appears (at least on summary judgment) that the school administrators treated her shabbily. When a teacher teaches, \"the school system does not `regulate' [that] speech as much as it <i>hires</i> that speech. Expression is a teacher's stock in trade, the commodity she sells to her employer in exchange for a salary.\" <i>Mayer v. Monroe County Cmty. Sch. Corp.,</i> 474 F.3d 477, 479 (7th Cir.2007). And if it is the school board that hires that speech, it can surely \"regulate the content of what is or is not expressed,\" <i>Rosenberger v. Rector &amp; Visitors of the Univ. of Va.,</i> 515 U.S. 819, 833, 115 S.Ct. 2510, 132 L.Ed.2d 700 (1995), what is expressed in other words on its behalf. Only the school board has ultimate responsibility for what goes on in the classroom, legitimately giving it a say over what teachers may (or may not) teach in the classroom.</p>\n<p>It is true that teachers, like students, do not \"shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate.\" <i>Tinker v. Des Moines Indep. Cmty. Sch. Dist.,</i> 393 U.S. 503, 506, 89 S.Ct. 733, 21 L.Ed.2d 731 (1969). But that does not transform them into the employee <i>and</i> employer when it comes to deciding what, when and how English is taught to fifteen-year-old students. Consider the difference between the speech of Evans-Marshall and Marvin Pickering, teachers both. When Pickering sent a letter to the local newspaper criticizing the school board, he said something that any citizen has a right to say, and he did it on his own time and in his own name, not on the school's time or in its name. Yet when Evans-Marshall taught 9th grade English, she did something she was hired (and paid) to do, something she could not have done but for the Board's decision to hire her as a public school teacher. As with any other individual in the community, she had no more free-speech right to dictate the school's curriculum than she had to obtain a platforma teaching positionin the first instance for communicating her preferred list of books and teaching methods. \"[N]o relevant <span class=\"star-pagination\">*341</span> analogue\" exists between her in-class curricular speech and speech by private citizens. <i>Garcetti,</i> 547 U.S. at 424, 126 S.Ct. 1951.</p>\n<p>Teachers are not everyday citizens, Evans-Marshall insists, and they have a right \"to select books and methods of instruction for use in the classroom without interference from public officials.\" R.1 ¶ 32. But that is not what Ohio law provides or the First Amendment requires. Start with Ohio law. Under it, \"[t]he board of education of each city ... shall prescribe a curriculum.\" O.R.C. § 3313.60(A). State law gives elected officialsthe school boardnot teachers, not the chair of a department, not the principal, not even the superintendent, responsibility over the curriculum. This is an accountability measure, pure and simple, one that ensures the citizens of a community have a say over a matter of considerable importance to many of themtheir children's educationby giving them control over membership on the board.</p>\n<p>The First Amendment does not ban this policy choice or this accountability measure. The Constitution does not prohibit a State from creating elected school boards and from placing responsibility for the curriculum of each school district in the hands of each board. Teachers no doubt are \"required ... to speak or write\" and otherwise express themselves, <i>Garcetti,</i> 547 U.S. at 422, 126 S.Ct. 1951, but this does not make them \"sovereign[s] unto [themselves],\" <i>Parate v. Isibor,</i> 868 F.2d 821, 827 (6th Cir.1989). \"The curricular choices of the schools should be presumptively their ownthe fact that such choices arouse deep feelings argues strongly for democratic means of reaching them.\" <i>Boring v. Buncombe County Bd. of Educ.,</i> 136 F.3d 364, 371-72 (4th Cir.1998) (en banc) (Wilkinson, C.J., concurring).</p>\n<p>How at any rate would a contrary approach work? If one teacher, Evans-Marshall, has a First Amendment right \"to select books and methods of instruction for use in the classroom,\" R.1 ¶ 32, so presumably do other teachers. Evans-Marshall may wish to teach <i>Siddhartha</i> in the first unit of the school year in a certain way, but the chair of the English department may wish to use the limited time in a school year to teach <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i> at that stage of the year. Maybe the head of the upper school has something else in mind. When educators disagree over what should be assigned, as is surely bound to happen if each of them has a First Amendment right to influence the curriculum, whose free-speech rights win? Why indeed doesn't the principal, Wray, have a right to defend the discharge on the ground that he was merely exercising <i>his</i> First Amendment rights in rejecting Evans-Marshall's curricular choices and methods of teaching? Placing the First Amendment's stamp of approval on these kinds of debates not only would \"demand permanent judicial intervention in the conduct of governmental operations,\" <i>Garcetti,</i> 547 U.S. at 423, 126 S.Ct. 1951, but it also would transform run-of-the-mine curricular disputes into constitutional stalemates.</p>\n<p>That is not the only problem. What employer discipline arising from an employee's manner of teachingchoices of books and the methods of teaching them does not implicate speech? Could a teacher respond to a principal's insistence that she discuss certain materials by claiming that it improperly <i>compels</i> speech? <i>Cf. </i><i>W. Va. State Bd. of Educ. v. Barnette,</i> 319 U.S. 624, 63 S.Ct. 1178, 87 L.Ed. 1628 (1943). Could a teacher continue to assign materials that members of the community perceive as racially insensitive even after the principal tells her not to? Could a teacher raise a controversial topic (say, the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*342</span> virtues of one theory of government over another or the virtues of intelligent design) after a principal has told her not to? Could a teacher introduce mature sexual themes to fifteen year olds when discussing a work of literature after a principal has told her not to? And \"[d]oes a music teacher retain veto power over that most controversial of school productionsthe Holiday Concert?\" <i>Evans-Marshall I,</i> 428 F.3d at 237-38 (Sutton, J., concurring).</p>\n<p>Because \"one man's vulgarity is another's lyric,\" <i>Cohen v. California,</i> 403 U.S. 15, 25, 91 S.Ct. 1780, 29 L.Ed.2d 284 (1971), or, as one school board member put the point at the November 2001 meeting, \"what you might find offensive, I might not,\" R.46 at 1:41:40, parents long have demanded that school boards control the curriculum and the ways of teaching it to their impressionable children. Permitting federal courts to distinguish classroom vulgarities from lyrics or to pick sides on how to teach <i>Siddhartha</i> not only is a recipe for disenfranchising the 9,000 or so members of the Tipp City community but also tests judicial competence. \"If even the most happily married parents cannot agree on what and how their own children should be taught, as [we] suspect is not infrequently the case, what leads anyone to think the federal judiciary can answer these questions?\" <i>Evans-Marshall I,</i> 428 F.3d at 237-38 (Sutton, J., concurring).</p>\n<p>The key insight of <i>Garcetti</i> is that the First Amendment has nothing to say about these kinds of decisions. An employee does not lose \"any liberties the employee might have enjoyed as a private citizen\" by signing on to work for the government, but by the same token, the government, just like a private employer, retains \"control over what the employer itself has commissioned or created\": the employee's job. <i>Garcetti,</i> 547 U.S. at 422, 126 S.Ct. 1951. And that insight has particular resonance in the context of public education. Every child in Ohio must attend school, <i>see</i> O.R.C. § 3321.02, providing public school teachers with a captive audience for their in-class speech, <i>see </i><i>Mayer,</i> 474 F.3d at 479, and providing a compelling reason for putting curricular choices in the hands of \"someone [they] can vote out of office,\" <i>id.</i> at 479-80, or who is otherwise democratically accountable, <i>see</i> O.R.C. § 3311.71 (elected officials and other community institutions appoint school board members in certain municipal school districts).</p>\n<p>In concluding that the First Amendment does not protect primary and secondary school teachers' in-class curricular speech, we have considerable company. The Seventh Circuit invoked <i>Garcetti</i> in concluding that the curricular and pedagogical choices of primary and secondary school teachers exceed the reach of the First Amendment. <i>Mayer,</i> 474 F.3d at 480. The Fourth Circuit has not applied <i>Garcetti</i> to teachers' in-class speech, <i>see </i><i>Lee v. York County Sch. Div.,</i> 484 F.3d 687, 694 n. 11 (4th Cir.2007), and is sometimes cited as creating a division among the circuits, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>Gorum v. Sessoms,</i> 561 F.3d 179, 186 n. 6 (3d Cir.2009). But that is because the Fourth Circuit disposed of the teacher's retaliation claim based on pre-<i>Garcetti</i> precedent, namely <i>Connick,</i> holding that \"speech that occurs within a compulsory classroom setting\" \"does not constitute speech on a matter of public concern\" when it is \"curricular in nature.\" 484 F.3d at 695, 697. The Fourth Circuit's approach changes nothing here: A teacher's curricular and pedagogical choices are categorically unprotected, whether under <i>Connick</i> or <i>Garcetti.</i></p>\n<p>The Third Circuit also has declined to resolve the applicability of <i>Garcetti</i> to this sort of speech, <i>see </i><i>Borden v. Sch. Dist. of Twp. of E. Brunswick,</i> 523 F.3d 153, 171 n. 13 (3d Cir.2008), but that too makes no <span class=\"star-pagination\">*343</span> difference. Its pre-<i>Garcetti</i> cases hold that, \"although [a teacher] has a right to advocate outside of the classroom for the use of certain curriculum materials, he does not have a right to use those materials in the classroom.\" <i>Edwards v. Cal. Univ. of Pa.,</i> 156 F.3d 488, 491 (3d Cir. 1998) (Alito, J.). The Tenth Circuit has applied <i>Garcetti</i> to a school teacher's speech <i>about</i> curriculum and pedagogy, even when made outside the classroom, <i>see </i><i>Brammer-Hoelter v. Twin Peaks Charter Acad.,</i> 492 F.3d 1192, 1204 (10th Cir.2007), but has not addressed <i>in-class</i> curricular speech. The Second Circuit determined, in an unpublished decision, that it need not resolve whether a teacher's in-class speech is governed by <i>Garcetti</i> or by its earlier cases applying the \"reasonably related to legitimate pedagogical concerns\" standard of <i>Hazelwood School District v. Kuhlmeier,</i> 484 U.S. 260, 273, 108 S.Ct. 562, 98 L.Ed.2d 592 (1988). <i>See </i><i>Panse v. Eastwood,</i> 303 Fed.Appx. 933, 935 (2d Cir. 2008). Other courts of appeals, including this one, have applied <i>Garcetti</i> in rejecting school employees' speech claims, though not in the context of curricular and pedagogical choices. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Fox v. Traverse City Area Pub. Sch. Bd. of Educ.,</i> 605 F.3d 345, 349 (6th Cir.2010); <i>Williams v. Dallas Indep. Sch. Dist.,</i> 480 F.3d 689, 694 (5th Cir.2007); <i>Gilder-Lucas v. Elmore County Bd. of Educ.,</i> 186 Fed.Appx. 885, 887 (11th Cir.2006). The common thread through all of these cases is that, when it comes to in-class curricular speech at the primary or secondary school level, no other court of appeals has held that such speech is protected by the First Amendment.</p>\n<p>Our decision also respects Sixth Circuit authority. In <i>Cockrel</i> and in our initial decision in this case, we held that a school teacher's curricular and pedagogical choices (1) are \"speech,\" (2) touch on \"matters of public concern\" and (3) may satisfy <i>Pickering</i> balancing depending on the circumstances developed in discovery or at trial. We do not disturb those holdings and indeed have ruled for the plaintiff on each one of these points today.</p>\n<p>Not one of these Sixth Circuit cases, however, addressed whether in-class curricular speech survives the threshold inquiry announced in <i>Garcetti:</i> whether the speech was \"pursuant to\" the claimant's official duties. 547 U.S. at 421, 126 S.Ct. 1951. How could they? <i>Garcetti</i> came down <i>after</i> both decisions and established a new threshold requirement in this area. Evans-Marshall's failure to satisfy this requirement governs us here. \"[A] plaintiff may not run home before she reaches first base.\" <i>Weathers v. Lafayette Parish Sch. Bd.,</i> 520 F.Supp.2d 827, 837 (W.D.La.2007).</p>\n<p>Nor can Evans-Marshall sidestep this conclusion on the theory that <i>Garcetti</i> does not apply. In his dissent in <i>Garcetti,</i> as Evans-Marshall points out, Justice Souter raised concerns about the applicability of the decision to \"academic freedom in public colleges and universities.\" 547 U.S. at 438, 126 S.Ct. 1951 (Souter, J., dissenting). The majority disclaimed any intent to resolve the point. <i>See id.</i> at 425, 126 S.Ct. 1951 (majority opinion) (\"Justice Souter suggests today's decision may have important ramifications for academic freedom.... We need not, and for that reason do not, decide whether the analysis we conduct today would apply in the same manner to a case involving speech related to scholarship or teaching.\").</p>\n<p><i>Garcetti's</i> caveat offers no refuge to Evans-Marshall. She is not a teacher at a \"public college[ ]\" or \"universit[y]\" and thus falls outside of the group the dissent wished to protect. The concept of \"academic freedom,\" moreover, does not readily apply to in-class curricular speech at the high school level. As a cultural and a legal principle, academic freedom \"was conceived <span class=\"star-pagination\">*344</span> and implemented in the university\" out of concern for \"teachers who are also researchers or scholarswork not generally expected of elementary and secondary school teachers.\" J. Peter Byrne, <i>Academic Freedom: A \"Special Concern of the First Amendment\",</i> 99 Yale L.J. 251, 288 n. 137 (1989). \"[U]niversities occupy a special niche in our constitutional tradition\" and the constitutional rules applicable in higher education do not necessarily apply in primary and secondary schools, where students generally do not choose whether or where they will attend school. <i>Parents Involved in Cmty. Sch. v. Seattle Sch. Dist. No. 1,</i> 551 U.S. 701, 724-25, 127 S.Ct. 2738, 168 L.Ed.2d 508 (2007).</p>\n<p>Even to the extent academic freedom, as a constitutional rule, could somehow apply to primary and secondary schools, that does not insulate a teacher's curricular and pedagogical choices from the school board's oversight, as opposed to the teacher's right to speak and write publicly about academic issues outside of the classroom. \"[I]t is the educational institution that has a right to academic freedom, not the individual teacher.\" <i>Borden,</i> 523 F.3d at 172 n. 14. Academic freedom implicates \"[t]he freedom of a university to make its own judgments as to education,\" <i>Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke,</i> 438 U.S. 265, 312, 98 S.Ct. 2733, 57 L.Ed.2d 750 (1978) (opinion of Powell, J.), requiring \"deference to a university's academic decisions,\" <i>Grutter v. Bollinger,</i> 539 U.S. 306, 328, 123 S.Ct. 2325, 156 L.Ed.2d 304 (2003). <i>See </i><i>Sweezy v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">689</span></a></span> (2006), we affirm the judgment rejecting this claim as a matter of law.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>In 2000, the Tipp City Board of Education hired Evans-Marshall to teach English and to supervise Tippecanoe High School's literary magazine, BirchBark, for the 2000-2001 school year. The Board renewed her contract for the 2001-2002 school year, when Evans-Marshall taught English to 9th and 11th grade students and a creative writing course to 11th and 12th grade students. At the beginning of the fall semester, Evans-Marshall assigned Ray Bradbury's <i>Fahrenheit 451</i> to her 9th graders. To the end of exploring the book's theme of government censorship, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*335</span> she distributed a list compiled by the American Library Association of the \"100 Most Frequently Challenged Books.\" Students divided into groups, and Evans-Marshall asked each group to pick a book from the list, to investigate the reasons why the book was challenged and to lead an in-class debate about the book. Two groups chose <i>Heather Has Two Mommies</i> by Lesléa Newman.</p>\n<p>A parent complained about <i>Heather Has Two Mommies,</i> and the principal, Charles Wray, asked Evans-Marshall to tell the students to choose a different book. She complied, explaining to her class that \"they were in a unique position to ... use this experience as source material for their debate because they were in the ... position of having actually experienced censorship in preparing to debate censorship.\" R.31-2 at 342-43. After the class completed the <i>Fahrenheit 451</i> unit, Evans-Marshall assigned <i>Siddhartha</i> by Hermann Hesse and used it as the basis for in-class discussions about \"spirituality, Buddhism, romantic relationships, personal growth, [and] familial relationships.\" R.31-1 at 101.</p>\n<p>At the October 2001 meeting of the school board, twenty-five or so parents complained about the curricular choices in the schools, including <i>Siddhartha</i> and the book-censorship assignment. The next day, Principal Wray called a meeting of the English department and told Evans-Marshall that she was \"on the hot seat.\" R.31-1 at 64. Nearly 100 parents, as well as the local news media, attended the board's November meeting. For over an hour, parents expressed concerns about books in the curriculum and in the school libraries. While the parents mentioned many books, they raised particular objections to the materials in Evans-Marshall's classroom and her teaching methods. Superintendent John Zigler explained that the school board had purchased many of the materials, including <i>Siddhartha,</i> several years before, making it difficult to criticize Evans-Marshall for teaching a book the school board had bought. \"You should be embarrassed,\" one parent responded, referring to the explicit language and sexual themes in the book. R.46 at 1:32:20. Another parent complained that she had asked for an alternative assignmentinstead of <i>Siddhartha</i>and \"was given three books,\" two of which \"were for a four-to-eight year old.\" R.46 at 1:33:40. \"I'm not going to put my daughter through this,\" the parent added, explaining that she thought Evans-Marshall was \"punish[ing] my daughter.\" R.46 at 1:33:40. A group of parents presented the board with a 500-signature petition calling for \"decency and excellence\" in the classroom. R.46 at 0:29:00, 0:55:00.</p>\n<p>The meeting was not one-sided. A member of the boarda parent himself warned that the school district's policies about potentially objectionable material \"have to be well thought out because what you might find offensive, I might not.\" R.46 at 1:41:40. Another board member reminded the group that, as elected officials, the board \"must walk the middle of the road to some extent,\" even if the community might \"err ... on the conservative side.\" R.46 at 0:20:45. And a parent who made a formal statement said that he \"[did not] condone\" the behavior of some of the more vocal parents and trusted that school officials \"want what's best for our kids.\" R.46 at 0:22:00.</p>\n<p>The matter did not end there. In teaching creative writing, Evans-Marshall maintained a file of student writing samples that she shared with students who asked for additional guidance on assignments. Running low on copies of some of the samples, she sent three of them to support staff to be copied. A member of the copy room staff, apparently not a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*336</span> friend, showed the writing samples to Wray, saying he \"ought to read this.\" R.33-1 at 76. After reading the papers, Wray called Evans-Marshall to his office. When she arrived, he waved two of the writing samples in his hand, one a first-hand account of a rape, the other a story about a young boy who murdered a priest and desecrated a church. \"[A]re you going to use these in class after everything that's happened?\" he shouted. R.31-1 at 84. Evans-Marshall explained that the writing samples were not intended for in-class distribution and that she would refrain from sharing the papers if he wanted. Wray said that he did not like the materials she was using in her classroom or the themes of her in-class discussions and that he \"intended to rei[n] it in.\" R.41 at 24-25.</p>\n<p>The two soon had another argument in the school library about Evans-Marshall's plans to give a final exam involving group discussions and student self-evaluations. Evans-Marshall asked Wray to give her a model exam so she could \"give [him] back exactly what [he] want[ed],\" R.31-1 at 43, prompting Wray to call her a \"smart a,\" <i>id.</i> at 41-42. The next day, Evans-Marshall complained to Superintendent Zigler about Wray's behavior. Zigler told her to meet with Wray after the semester break to work things out and offered to speak with Wray in the meantime. He also said that she should feel free to file a formal grievance if things had not been worked out by January.</p>\n<p>Things did not work out by January. Wray and Evans-Marshall talked, but they fell back into the same channels of disagreement. Evans-Marshall asked whether there was anything aside from her curricular decisions that bothered Wray. \"I'll see what other issues I can come up with,\" Wray responded, \"for your evaluation next week.\" R.31-1 at 52-53. Wray's evaluations criticized Evans-Marshall's attitude and demeanor as well as her \"[u]se of material that is pushing the limits of community standards.\" R.31-5 at 38-39. Evans-Marshall filed written objections to Wray's evaluations and a grievance with Superintendent Zigler.</p>\n<p>At its March 2002 meeting, the school board voted unanimously not to renew Evans-Marshall's contract. She requested an explanation, and the school board sent her a letter on April 9, 2002, saying that her non-renewal was \"due to problems with communication and teamwork.\" R.31-6 at 10. At Evans-Marshall's request, the board held a formal hearing about the employment decision. Principal Wray, Superintendent Zigler and Evans-Marshall all testified, and the board again voted unanimously not to renew her contract.</p>\n<p>(The alert reader may notice that some of the factual allegations raised in Evans-Marshall's complaint and addressed in our first decision do not appear here. <i>See </i><i>Evans-Marshall v. Bd. of Educ.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"792362\"><a href=\"/opinion/792362/shelley-evans-marshall-v-board-of-education-of-the-tipp-city-exempted/\"><span class=\"volume\">428</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">223</span></a></span>, 226-27 (6th Cir.2005) (<i>Evans-Marshall I</i>). The distinction between a Civil Rule 12(b)(6) and a Civil Rule 56 appeal explains the difference. As is often the case, discovery will confirm the accuracy of some allegations and disprove others. We recount today only the allegations in the complaint backed up by \"the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c)(2).)</p>\n<p>In March 2003, Evans-Marshall filed this § 1983 action against the school board, Wray and Zigler. She alleged that the school board and other defendants had retaliated against her \"curricular and pedagogical choices,\" infringing her First Amendment right \"to select books and methods of instruction for use in the classroom without interference from public officials.\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*337</span> R.1 ¶¶ 32, 36. The defendants moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim under Civil Rule 12(b)(6), but the district court held that Evans-Marshall had sufficiently alleged a First Amendment violation. We affirmed. <i>Evans-Marshall I,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"792362\"><a href=\"/opinion/792362/shelley-evans-marshall-v-board-of-education-of-the-tipp-city-exempted/\"><span class=\"volume\">428</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">223</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>After discovery by both sides, the defendants again moved for summary judgment, arguing that the Supreme Court's intervening decision in <i>Garcetti v. Ceballos,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145653\"><a href=\"/opinion/145653/garcetti-v-ceballos/\"><span class=\"volume\">547</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">410</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145653\"><a href=\"/opinion/145653/garcetti-v-ceballos/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">689</span></a></span> (2006), and the unrebutted facts gleaned from discovery foreclosed Evans-Marshall's claim. In the alternative, they sought summary judgment on the ground that the school board should prevail under the balancing test announced in <i>Pickering v. Board of Education,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107717\"><a href=\"/opinion/107717/pickering-v-board-of-ed-of-township-high-school-dist-205-will-cty/\"><span class=\"volume\">391</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">563</span></a></span>, 572-73, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107717\"><a href=\"/opinion/107717/pickering-v-board-of-ed-of-township-high-school-dist-205-will-cty/\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">811</span></a></span> (1968), or that there was no causal link between Evans-Marshall's curricular choices and the non-renewal of her contract. The district court granted the defendants' summary judgment motion. It declined to apply <i>Garcetti</i> to the dispute and held that Evans-Marshall's teaching methods and curricular choices survived the <i>Pickering</i> balancing test. But it concluded that she had not provided sufficient evidence \"link[ing] her teaching\" methods and curricular choices to \"the Board's decision to not renew her contract.\" R.52 at 47.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>This free-speech-retaliation case implicates two competing intuitions. On the one side, doesn't a teacher have the First Amendment right to choose her own reading assignments, decide how they should be taught and above all be able to teach a unit on censorship without being censored or otherwise retaliated against? On the other side, doesn't a school board have the final say over what is taught, and how, in the public schools for which it is responsible? Who wins depends on which line of legal authority controls.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A.</h2>\n<p>In free-speech retaliation cases arising in the employment context, we ask three questions: Was the individual involved in \"constitutionally protected\" activityhere activity protected by the free speech clause of the First Amendment? <i>Mt. Healthy City Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109574\"><a href=\"/opinion/109574/mt-healthy-city-bd-of-ed-v-doyle/\"><span class=\"volume\">429</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">274</span></a></span>, 287, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109574\"><a href=\"/opinion/109574/mt-healthy-city-bd-of-ed-v-doyle/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Was the employee's exercise of constitutionally protected rights \"a motivating factor\" behind the employer's conduct? <i>Mt. Healthy,</i> 429 U.S. at 287, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109574\"><a href=\"/opinion/109574/mt-healthy-city-bd-of-ed-v-doyle/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">568</span></a></span>. The claimant must win each point to prevail.</p>\n<p>The first question requires some elaboration. Three Supreme Court cases define the contours of the free-speech rights of public employees.</p>\n<p><i>The \"matters of public concern\" requirement.</i> The First Amendment protects the speech of employees only when it involves \"matters of public concern.\" <i>Connick v. Myers,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110917\"><a href=\"/opinion/110917/connick-v-myers/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">138</span></a></span>, 143, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110917\"><a href=\"/opinion/110917/connick-v-myers/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">708</span></a></span> (1983). In <i>Connick,</i> an assistant district attorney, after learning that her supervisor planned to transfer her, solicited information from her colleagues about the office's transfer policy, about office morale and about whether supervisors had pressured anyone to participate in political campaigning. <i>Id.</i> at 141, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110917\"><a href=\"/opinion/110917/connick-v-myers/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1684</span></a></span>. When the supervisor fired her for refusing to accept the transfer, she sued, alleging retaliation against protected speech, namely her initiation of the survey. <i>Id.</i> In rejecting her claim, the Court explained <span class=\"star-pagination\">*338</span> that not all employee speech is protected, only speech that \"fairly [may be] considered as relating to\" issues \"of political, social, or other concern to the community.\" <i>Id.</i> at 146, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110917\"><a href=\"/opinion/110917/connick-v-myers/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1684</span></a></span>. When, by contrast, an employee's speech does not relate to a matter of public concern, public officials enjoy \"wide latitude\" in responding to it without \"intrusive oversight by the judiciary in the name of the First Amendment.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p><i>The \"balancing\" requirement.</i> If the employee establishes that her speech touches \"matters of public concern,\" a balancing test determines whether the employee or the employer wins. <i>See </i><i>Pickering,</i> 391 U.S. at 568, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107717\"><a href=\"/opinion/107717/pickering-v-board-of-ed-of-township-high-school-dist-205-will-cty/\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1731</span></a></span>. In <i>Pickering,</i> the Court considered the claim of a high school teacher whom the principal fired after the teacher wrote a letter to the local newspaper, criticizing the school board's budgetary decisions. <i>Id.</i> at 564, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107717\"><a href=\"/opinion/107717/pickering-v-board-of-ed-of-township-high-school-dist-205-will-cty/\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1731</span></a></span>. In resolving the claim, the Court \"balance[d] ... the interests of the teacher, as a citizen, in commenting upon matters of public concern\" against \"the interest of the State, as an employer, in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees.\" <i>Id.</i> at 568, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107717\"><a href=\"/opinion/107717/pickering-v-board-of-ed-of-township-high-school-dist-205-will-cty/\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1731</span></a></span>. Reasoning that there was no relationship between the contents of the letter and the \"proper performance of [the teacher's] daily duties in the classroom,\" the Court ruled for the teacher, concluding that the school board's interests did not outweigh his desire to \"contribute to public debate\" like any other citizen. <i>Id.</i> at 572-73, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107717\"><a href=\"/opinion/107717/pickering-v-board-of-ed-of-township-high-school-dist-205-will-cty/\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1731</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p><i>The \"pursuant to\" requirement.</i> In the last case in the trilogy, a prosecutor reviewed a private complaint that a police officer's affidavit used to obtain a search warrant contained several misrepresentations. <i>Garcetti,</i> 547 U.S. at 413-14, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145653\"><a href=\"/opinion/145653/garcetti-v-ceballos/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1951</span></a></span>. After confirming that the affidavit contained serious falsehoods, the prosecutor wrote a memo to his superiors about his findings, recommended that the office dismiss the case and eventually testified to the same effect at a hearing to suppress the evidence discovered during the search. <i>Id.</i> at 414-15, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145653\"><a href=\"/opinion/145653/garcetti-v-ceballos/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1951</span></a></span>. In the aftermath of these and other actions, the prosecutor claimed that the office retaliated against him by transferring him to another courthouse and by denying him a promotion. <i>Id.</i> at 415, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145653\"><a href=\"/opinion/145653/garcetti-v-ceballos/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1951</span></a></span>. In rejecting his free-speech claim, the Court did not deny that the prosecutor's speech related to a matter of \"public concern\" under <i>Connick,</i> and it did not take on the lower court's reasoning that <i>Pickering</i> balancing favored the employee. It instead concluded that the First Amendment did not apply. \"The controlling factor,\" the Court reasoned, \"is that his expressions were made <i>pursuant to</i> his duties as a calendar deputy,\" making the relevant speaker the government entity, not the individual. <i>Id.</i> at 421, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145653\"><a href=\"/opinion/145653/garcetti-v-ceballos/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1951</span></a></span> (emphasis added). \"We hold that when public employees make statements pursuant to their official duties, the employees are not speaking as citizens for First Amendment purposes, and the Constitution does not insulate their communications from employer discipline.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B.</h2>\n<p>A First Amendment claimant must satisfy <i>each</i> of these requirements: the <i>Connick</i> \"matter of public concern\" requirement, the <i>Pickering</i> \"balancing\" requirement and the <i>Garcetti</i> \"pursuant to\" requirement. Evans-Marshall clears the first two of these hurdles but not the third.</p>\n<p>The content of Evans-Marshall's speech \"relat[ed] to ... matter[s] of political, social, or other concern to the community.\" <i>Connick,</i> 461 U.S. at 146, 103 S.Ct. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*339</span> 1684. A teacher's curricular speech, we have said on several occasions, ordinarily covers these matters. <i>See </i><i>Evans-Marshall I,</i> 428 F.3d at 230-31; <i>Cockrel v. Shelby County Sch. Dist.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"775498\"><a href=\"/opinion/775498/donna-cockrel-v-shelby-county-school-district/\"><span class=\"volume\">270</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1036</span></a></span>, 1052 (6th Cir.2001); <i>Hardy v.

Look no further than the November 2001 meeting of the school board to confirm the point. Members of the community had a lot to say about the topics discussed in Evans-Marshall's class, and they went to the school board meeting to say it. That large segments of the community disagreed with Evans-Marshall's speechher class assignments and teaching methods is beside the point. The question is whether the topics discussed are \"of ... concern\" to the community, <i>Connick,</i> 461 U.S. at 146, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110917\"><a href=\"/opinion/110917/connick-v-myers/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1684</span></a></span>, not whether the community approved of the teacher's position on each topic. On this summary-judgment record, Evans-Marshall's curricular speech passes the <i>Connick</i> \"matter of public concern\" test, as the district court correctly determined.</p>\n<p>Evans-Marshall also satisfies <i>Pickering</i> \"balancing\"that her \"interests ... as a citizen, in commenting upon matters of public concern\" through her in-class speech outweighed the school board's \"interest... as an employer, in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs.\" <i>Pickering,</i> 391 U.S. at 568, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107717\"><a href=\"/opinion/107717/pickering-v-board-of-ed-of-township-high-school-dist-205-will-cty/\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1731</span></a></span>. As the district court correctly concluded, a legitimate factual dispute exists over whether Evans-Marshall's interest in teaching <i>Siddhartha</i> (and in making other curricular choices) overshadowed any interest the school board might claim in disciplining her for doing so. Although the school board has \"the ability to select and require adherence to a ... stated curriculum,\" R.52 at 26, the court concluded, its interest in enforcing curricular standards is severely undermined if it disciplines a teacher for teaching a book the board \"had purchased ... and made ... available to teachers as an optional text,\" <i>id.</i> at 40-41. And although the court did not find Evans-Marshall's interest in \"select[ing] materials to supplement the Board-chosen textbooks ... and the methods for teaching\" to be compelling, <i>id.</i> at 32, that interest outweighed the school's near-zero interest in disciplining her for teaching a book it had purchased, <i>id.</i> at 41. We agreefor many of the same reasons identified in <i>Evans-Marshall I. See</i> 428 F.3d at 231-32.</p>\n<p>After addressing the <i>Pickering</i> point, however, the district court concluded that Evans-Marshall stumbled over causation. The court did not believe that Evans-Marshall could show that her exercise of free speech rights was \"a motivating factor\" behind the school board's conduct. <i>See </i><i>Mt. Healthy,</i> 429 U.S. at 287, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109574\"><a href=\"/opinion/109574/mt-healthy-city-bd-of-ed-v-doyle/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">568</span></a></span>. That is a harder point to sell. And a brief accounting of the evidence and the chronology of events shows why.</p>\n<p>Before any parents complained about her reading assignments and classroom discussions, Evans-Marshall had never received a negative performance review. Dozens of parents flooded the school board's November 2001 meeting, and many complained about Evans-Marshall's teaching. One parent told the school board that it \"should be embarrassed\" about the book she was teaching. R.46 at 1:32:20. Principal Wray thereafter told Evans-Marshall that she would have to clear any potentially controversial material with him. He later told Evans-Marshall that he \"intended to rei[n] ... in\" her <span class=\"star-pagination\">*340</span> classroom discussions. R.41 at 24-25. In December 2001, Evans-Marshall complained to Superintendent Zigler about Wray's behavior. And when the semester resumed in January 2002, Wray told Evans-Marshall that he would \"see what ... [he could] come up with for [her] evaluations,\" R.31-1 at 52-53, after which he gave her negative performance reviews for the first time. Only a short time later, the board voted not to renew her contract. To deny a causal relationship between Evans-Marshall's speech and the Board's actions does not come to grips with this sequence of events or with the imperative at this stage of the litigation that we draw all inferences in favor of the non-moving party: the teacher. Evans-Marshall satisfies <i>Pickering</i> balancing and has shown that her teaching choices caused the school board to fire her.</p>\n<p>Evans-Marshall, however, cannot overcome <i>Garcetti.</i> When government employees speak \"pursuant to their official duties,\" <i>Garcetti</i> teaches that they are \"not speaking as citizens for First Amendment purposes.\" 547 U.S. at 421, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145653\"><a href=\"/opinion/145653/garcetti-v-ceballos/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1951</span></a></span>. Any dispute over the board's motivations, <i>Pickering</i> balancing or the \"public concerns\" of her speech under <i>Connick</i> is beside the point if, as Evans-Marshall does not dispute, she made her curricular and pedagogical choices in connection with her official duties as a teacher.</p>\n<p>In the light cast by <i>Garcetti,</i> it is clear that the First Amendment does not generally \"insulate\" Evans-Marshall \"from employer discipline,\" <i>Garcetti,</i> 547 U.S. at 421, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145653\"><a href=\"/opinion/145653/garcetti-v-ceballos/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1951</span></a></span>, even discipline prompted by her curricular and pedagogical choices and even if it otherwise appears (at least on summary judgment) that the school administrators treated her shabbily. When a teacher teaches, \"the school system does not `regulate' [that] speech as much as it <i>hires</i> that speech. Expression is a teacher's stock in trade, the commodity she sells to her employer in exchange for a salary.\" <i>Mayer v. Monroe County Cmty. Sch.

And if it is the school board that hires that speech, it can surely \"regulate the content of what is or is not expressed,\" <i>Rosenberger v. Rector &amp; Visitors of the Univ. of Va.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117967\"><a href=\"/opinion/117967/rosenberger-v-rector-and-visitors-of-univ-of-va/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">819</span></a></span>, 833, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117967\"><a href=\"/opinion/117967/rosenberger-v-rector-and-visitors-of-univ-of-va/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Only the school board has ultimate responsibility for what goes on in the classroom, legitimately giving it a say over what teachers may (or may not) teach in the classroom.</p>\n<p>It is true that teachers, like students, do not \"shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate.\" <i>Tinker v. Des Moines Indep. Cmty. Sch. Dist.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107841\"><a href=\"/opinion/107841/tinker-v-des-moines-independent-community-school-dist/\"><span class=\"volume\">393</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">503</span></a></span>, 506, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107841\"><a href=\"/opinion/107841/tinker-v-des-moines-independent-community-school-dist/\"><span class=\"volume\">89</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

But that does not transform them into the employee <i>and</i> employer when it comes to deciding what, when and how English is taught to fifteen-year-old students. Consider the difference between the speech of Evans-Marshall and Marvin Pickering, teachers both. When Pickering sent a letter to the local newspaper criticizing the school board, he said something that any citizen has a right to say, and he did it on his own time and in his own name, not on the school's time or in its name. Yet when Evans-Marshall taught 9th grade English, she did something she was hired (and paid) to do, something she could not have done but for the Board's decision to hire her as a public school teacher. As with any other individual in the community, she had no more free-speech right to dictate the school's curriculum than she had to obtain a platforma teaching positionin the first instance for communicating her preferred list of books and teaching methods. \"[N]o relevant <span class=\"star-pagination\">*341</span> analogue\" exists between her in-class curricular speech and speech by private citizens. <i>Garcetti,</i> 547 U.S. at 424, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145653\"><a href=\"/opinion/145653/garcetti-v-ceballos/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1951</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>Teachers are not everyday citizens, Evans-Marshall insists, and they have a right \"to select books and methods of instruction for use in the classroom without interference from public officials.\" R.1 ¶ 32. But that is not what Ohio law provides or the First Amendment requires. Start with Ohio law. Under it, \"[t]he board of education of each city ... shall prescribe a curriculum.\" O.R.C. § 3313.60(A). State law gives elected officialsthe school boardnot teachers, not the chair of a department, not the principal, not even the superintendent, responsibility over the curriculum. This is an accountability measure, pure and simple, one that ensures the citizens of a community have a say over a matter of considerable importance to many of themtheir children's educationby giving them control over membership on the board.</p>\n<p>The First Amendment does not ban this policy choice or this accountability measure. The Constitution does not prohibit a State from creating elected school boards and from placing responsibility for the curriculum of each school district in the hands of each board. Teachers no doubt are \"required ... to speak or write\" and otherwise express themselves, <i>Garcetti,</i> 547 U.S. at 422, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145653\"><a href=\"/opinion/145653/garcetti-v-ceballos/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1951</span></a></span>, but this does not make them \"sovereign[s] unto [themselves],\" <i>Parate v. Isibor,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"518890\"><a href=\"/opinion/518890/natthu-s-parate-v-edward-i-isibor-individually-and-in-his-official/\"><span class=\"volume\">868</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">821</span></a></span>, 827 (6th Cir.1989). \"The curricular choices of the schools should be presumptively their ownthe fact that such choices arouse deep feelings argues strongly for democratic means of reaching them.\" <i>Boring v. Buncombe County Bd. of Educ.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"751637\"><a href=\"/opinion/751637/margaret-boring-v-the-buncombe-county-board-of-education-charles-johnson/\"><span class=\"volume\">136</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">364</span></a></span>, 371-72 (4th Cir.1998) (en banc) (Wilkinson, C.J., concurring).</p>\n<p>How at any rate would a contrary approach work? If one teacher, Evans-Marshall, has a First Amendment right \"to select books and methods of instruction for use in the classroom,\" R.1 ¶ 32, so presumably do other teachers. Evans-Marshall may wish to teach <i>Siddhartha</i> in the first unit of the school year in a certain way, but the chair of the English department may wish to use the limited time in a school year to teach <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i> at that stage of the year. Maybe the head of the upper school has something else in mind. When educators disagree over what should be assigned, as is surely bound to happen if each of them has a First Amendment right to influence the curriculum, whose free-speech rights win? Why indeed doesn't the principal, Wray, have a right to defend the discharge on the ground that he was merely exercising <i>his</i> First Amendment rights in rejecting Evans-Marshall's curricular choices and methods of teaching? Placing the First Amendment's stamp of approval on these kinds of debates not only would \"demand permanent judicial intervention in the conduct of governmental operations,\" <i>Garcetti,</i> 547 U.S. at 423, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145653\"><a href=\"/opinion/145653/garcetti-v-ceballos/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1951</span></a></span>, but it also would transform run-of-the-mine curricular disputes into constitutional stalemates.</p>\n<p>That is not the only problem. What employer discipline arising from an employee's manner of teachingchoices of books and the methods of teaching them does not implicate speech? Could a teacher respond to a principal's insistence that she discuss certain materials by claiming that it improperly <i>compels</i> speech? <i>Cf. </i><i>W. Va. State Bd. of Educ. v. Barnette,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103870\"><a href=\"/opinion/103870/west-virginia-bd-of-ed-v-barnette/\"><span class=\"volume\">319</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">624</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">63</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">1628</span></span> (1943). Could a teacher continue to assign materials that members of the community perceive as racially insensitive even after the principal tells her not to? Could a teacher raise a controversial topic (say, the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*342</span> virtues of one theory of government over another or the virtues of intelligent design) after a principal has told her not to? Could a teacher introduce mature sexual themes to fifteen year olds when discussing a work of literature after a principal has told her not to? And \"[d]oes a music teacher retain veto power over that most controversial of school productionsthe Holiday Concert?\" <i>Evans-Marshall I,</i> 428 F.3d at 237-38 (Sutton, J., concurring).</p>\n<p>Because \"one man's vulgarity is another's lyric,\" <i>Cohen v. California,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108360\"><a href=\"/opinion/108360/cohen-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">403</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span>, 25, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108360\"><a href=\"/opinion/108360/cohen-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">91</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">284</span></a></span> (1971), or, as one school board member put the point at the November 2001 meeting, \"what you might find offensive, I might not,\" R.46 at 1:41:40, parents long have demanded that school boards control the curriculum and the ways of teaching it to their impressionable children. Permitting federal courts to distinguish classroom vulgarities from lyrics or to pick sides on how to teach <i>Siddhartha</i> not only is a recipe for disenfranchising the 9,000 or so members of the Tipp City community but also tests judicial competence. \"If even the most happily married parents cannot agree on what and how their own children should be taught, as [we] suspect is not infrequently the case, what leads anyone to think the federal judiciary can answer these questions?\" <i>Evans-Marshall I,</i> 428 F.3d at 237-38 (Sutton, J., concurring).</p>\n<p>The key insight of <i>Garcetti</i> is that the First Amendment has nothing to say about these kinds of decisions. An employee does not lose \"any liberties the employee might have enjoyed as a private citizen\" by signing on to work for the government, but by the same token, the government, just like a private employer, retains \"control over what the employer itself has commissioned or created\": the employee's job. <i>Garcetti,</i> 547 U.S. at 422, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145653\"><a href=\"/opinion/145653/garcetti-v-ceballos/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1951</span></a></span>. And that insight has particular resonance in the context of public education. Every child in Ohio must attend school, <i>see</i> O.R.C. § 3321.02, providing public school teachers with a captive audience for their in-class speech, <i>see </i><i>Mayer,</i> 474 F.3d at 479, and providing a compelling reason for putting curricular choices in the hands of \"someone [they] can vote out of office,\" <i>id.</i> at 479-80, or who is otherwise democratically accountable, <i>see</i> O.R.C. § 3311.71 (elected officials and other community institutions appoint school board members in certain municipal school districts).</p>\n<p>In concluding that the First Amendment does not protect primary and secondary school teachers' in-class curricular speech, we have considerable company. The Seventh Circuit invoked <i>Garcetti</i> in concluding that the curricular and pedagogical choices of primary and secondary school teachers exceed the reach of the First Amendment. <i>Mayer,</i> 474 F.3d at 480. The Fourth Circuit has not applied <i>Garcetti</i> to teachers' in-class speech, <i>see </i><i>Lee v. York County Sch. Div.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"797570\"><a href=\"/opinion/797570/william-lee-v-york-county-school-division-steven-r-staples-in-his/\"><span class=\"volume\">484</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">687</span></a></span>, 694 n. 11 (4th Cir.2007), and is sometimes cited as creating a division among the circuits, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>Gorum v. Sessoms,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1372742\"><a href=\"/opinion/1372742/gorum-v-sessoms/\"><span class=\"volume\">561</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">179</span></a></span>, 186 n. 6 (3d Cir.2009). But that is because the Fourth Circuit disposed of the teacher's retaliation claim based on pre-<i>Garcetti</i> precedent, namely <i>Connick,</i> holding that \"speech that occurs within a compulsory classroom setting\" \"does not constitute speech on a matter of public concern\" when it is \"curricular in nature.\" 484 F.3d at 695, 697. The Fourth Circuit's approach changes nothing here: A teacher's curricular and pedagogical choices are categorically unprotected, whether under <i>Connick</i> or <i>Garcetti.</i></p>\n<p>The Third Circuit also has declined to resolve the applicability of <i>Garcetti</i> to this sort of speech, <i>see </i><i>Borden v. Sch. Dist. of Twp. of E. Brunswick,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1443976\"><a href=\"/opinion/1443976/borden-v-school-dist-of-tp-of-east-brunswick/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">153</span></a></span>, 171 n. 13 (3d Cir.2008), but that too makes no <span class=\"star-pagination\">*343</span> difference. Its pre-<i>Garcetti</i> cases hold that, \"although [a teacher] has a right to advocate outside of the classroom for the use of certain curriculum materials, he does not have a right to use those materials in the classroom.\" <i>Edwards v. Cal. Univ. of Pa.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"758042\"><a href=\"/opinion/758042/dilawar-m-edwards-phd-v-california-university-of-pennsylvania-john/\"><span class=\"volume\">156</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">488</span></a></span>, 491 (3d Cir. 1998) (Alito, J.). The Tenth Circuit has applied <i>Garcetti</i> to a school teacher's speech <i>about</i> curriculum and pedagogy, even when made outside the classroom, <i>see </i><i>Brammer-Hoelter v. Twin Peaks Charter Acad.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"169475\"><a href=\"/opinion/169475/brammer-hoelter-v-twin-peaks-charter-academy/\"><span class=\"volume\">492</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1192</span></a></span>, 1204 (10th Cir.2007), but has not addressed <i>in-class</i> curricular speech. The Second Circuit determined, in an unpublished decision, that it need not resolve whether a teacher's in-class speech is governed by <i>Garcetti</i> or by its earlier cases applying the \"reasonably related to legitimate pedagogical concerns\" standard of <i>Hazelwood School District v. Kuhlmeier,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111979\"><a href=\"/opinion/111979/hazelwood-school-dist-v-kuhlmeier/\"><span class=\"volume\">484</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">260</span></a></span>, 273, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111979\"><a href=\"/opinion/111979/hazelwood-school-dist-v-kuhlmeier/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Other courts of appeals, including this one, have applied <i>Garcetti</i> in rejecting school employees' speech claims, though not in the context of curricular and pedagogical choices. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Fox v. Traverse City Area Pub. Sch. Bd. of Educ.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"146556\"><a href=\"/opinion/146556/fox-v-traverse-city-area-pub-sch-bd-of-educ/\"><span class=\"volume\">605</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">345</span></a></span>, 349 (6th Cir.2010); <i>Williams v.

Elmore County Bd. of Educ.,</i> 186 Fed.Appx. 885, 887 (11th Cir.2006). The common thread through all of these cases is that, when it comes to in-class curricular speech at the primary or secondary school level, no other court of appeals has held that such speech is protected by the First Amendment.</p>\n<p>Our decision also respects Sixth Circuit authority. In <i>Cockrel</i> and in our initial decision in this case, we held that a school teacher's curricular and pedagogical choices (1) are \"speech,\" (2) touch on \"matters of public concern\" and (3) may satisfy <i>Pickering</i> balancing depending on the circumstances developed in discovery or at trial. We do not disturb those holdings and indeed have ruled for the plaintiff on each one of these points today.</p>\n<p>Not one of these Sixth Circuit cases, however, addressed whether in-class curricular speech survives the threshold inquiry announced in <i>Garcetti:</i> whether the speech was \"pursuant to\" the claimant's official duties. 547 U.S. at 421, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145653\"><a href=\"/opinion/145653/garcetti-v-ceballos/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1951</span></a></span>. How could they? <i>Garcetti</i> came down <i>after</i> both decisions and established a new threshold requirement in this area. Evans-Marshall's failure to satisfy this requirement governs us here. \"[A] plaintiff may not run home before she reaches first base.\" <i>Weathers v. Lafayette Parish Sch. Bd.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1446100\"><a href=\"/opinion/1446100/weathers-v-lafayette-parish-school-bd/\"><span class=\"volume\">520</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">827</span></a></span>, 837 (W.D.La.2007).</p>\n<p>Nor can Evans-Marshall sidestep this conclusion on the theory that <i>Garcetti</i> does not apply. In his dissent in <i>Garcetti,</i> as Evans-Marshall points out, Justice Souter raised concerns about the applicability of the decision to \"academic freedom in public colleges and universities.\" 547 U.S. at 438, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145653\"><a href=\"/opinion/145653/garcetti-v-ceballos/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The majority disclaimed any intent to resolve the point. <i>See id.</i> at 425, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145653\"><a href=\"/opinion/145653/garcetti-v-ceballos/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1951</span></a></span> (majority opinion) (\"Justice Souter suggests today's decision may have important ramifications for academic freedom.... We need not, and for that reason do not, decide whether the analysis we conduct today would apply in the same manner to a case involving speech related to scholarship or teaching.\").</p>\n<p><i>Garcetti's</i> caveat offers no refuge to Evans-Marshall. She is not a teacher at a \"public college[ ]\" or \"universit[y]\" and thus falls outside of the group the dissent wished to protect. The concept of \"academic freedom,\" moreover, does not readily apply to in-class curricular speech at the high school level. As a cultural and a legal principle, academic freedom \"was conceived <span class=\"star-pagination\">*344</span> and implemented in the university\" out of concern for \"teachers who are also researchers or scholarswork not generally expected of elementary and secondary school teachers.\" J. Peter Byrne, <i>Academic Freedom: A \"Special Concern of the First Amendment\",</i> 99 Yale L.J. 251, 288 n. 137 (1989). \"[U]niversities occupy a special niche in our constitutional tradition\" and the constitutional rules applicable in higher education do not necessarily apply in primary and secondary schools, where students generally do not choose whether or where they will attend school. <i>Parents Involved in Cmty.

In the context of in-class curricular speech, this court has already said in the university arena that a teacher's invocation of academic freedom does not warrant judicial intrusion upon an educational institution's decisions: \"The First Amendment concept of academic freedom does not require that a nontenured professor be made a sovereign unto himself.\" <i>Parate,</i> 868 F.2d at 827. A school \"may constitutionally choose not to renew the contract of a nontenured professor\" when that professor's \"pedagogical attitude and teaching methods do not conform to institutional standards.\" <i>Id.</i> Just so here.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>For these reasons, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  The Honorable Robert H.
