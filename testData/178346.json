This case concerns the impact of Butler County’s proposed\nimprovement to Princeton Road on two 26-inch subterranean gas pipelines owned by\nTexas Gas. The pipelines intersect the road and, in part, run underneath Butler County’s\n66-foot wide right-of-way on Princeton Road. The improvement will accommodate the\ntraffic caused by the construction of a new residential subdivision and require the\nstrengthening or removal of Texas Gas’s underground pipelines. The majority of the\nimprovement will take place within Butler County’s 66-foot wide right-of-way, but a\nportion will occur alongside the right-of-way in an area where Texas Gas has a property\ninterest superior to that of Butler County. Before the district court, the parties brought\ncompeting claims for declaratory and injunctive relief, seeking a declaration of the\npriority of their respective property interests and of Butler County’s authority to order\nTexas Gas to strengthen or remove the pipelines underneath Princeton Road at the\ncompany’s expense.\n\n       After a bench trial, the district court granted Butler County declaratory relief and\nentered an order providing, in relevant part for this appeal, that: (1) Butler County had\na 66-foot wide right-of-way that was superior to Texas Gas’s pipeline easements; (2) the\nplanned improvements to Princeton Road are not an unreasonable interference with\nTexas Gas’s easements; and (3) Ohio Revised Code § 5547.03 granted Butler County\nthe authority to order Texas Gas to strengthen or remove the pipelines at its own\nexpense.   Texas Gas timely appealed, arguing that the district court improperly\ninterpreted Ohio Revised Code § 5547.03 and that the district court’s order authorized\nan unconstitutional taking of its superior interest in the land running alongside Butler\nCounty’s right-of-way.\n\n       At oral argument, it became apparent that the dispute between the parties is a\nnarrow one. Texas Gas emphasized that it is not appealing the district court’s settlement\n\fNo. 09-3743        Texas Gas Transmissions, LLC v. Butler County                   Page 3\n                   Bd. of Comm’rs, et al.\n\n\nof the competing property claims within the 66-foot wide Princeton Road right-of-way.\nIndeed, Texas Gas does not dispute that Butler County has a superior interest within that\narea and may order it to strengthen or remove the pipelines. On the other hand, counsel\nfor Butler County stated expressly that the County is not asking us to affirm the district\ncourt’s judgment to the extent it authorizes the County to order Texas Gas to strengthen\nor remove the portions of its pipelines outside of the County’s right-of-way. Counsel\nindicated that so long as the County may act within its right-of-way, we “don’t even\nhave to reach” the issue of its rights outside that area. In essence, Butler County wants\nthe authority to act within its right-of-way, to which Texas Gas has no objection, and\nTexas Gas wants to prevent Butler County from ordering it to alter the pipelines outside\nof the County’s right-of-way, to which Butler County has no objection.\n\n       At oral argument, counsel for Texas Gas insisted that the issue before the court\non appeal was the correctness of the district court’s decision with respect to the area\noutside the right of way in which Texas Gas has the superior interest. To analyze this\nissue properly, we must closely examine the district court’s opinion. The operative\nlanguage of the declaratory judgment does not specify that it applies to the area outside\nthe right of way as well as the area within it. Yet clearly the opinion as a whole\ninterprets the statute to allow Butler County to direct Texas Gas to remove or reinforce\nits pipelines at Texas Gas’s expense. Clearly, also, the opinion denies Texas Gas an\ninjunction and thus permits the project to go forward. And as a practical matter, going\nforward with the project and paying for removal or reinforcement of the pipelines\ninvolve portions of the pipelines that are both within and outside the right of way. The\ndistrict court unmistakably avoided any issues that Texas Gas might raise through resort\nto state remedies, as well as issues that might be raised in a Takings Clause claim made\nafter state remedies were exhausted. And in fact, the district court recognized that Texas\nGas “may” be entitled to partial compensation to the extent the pipelines are affected by\nthe new berm, which is the area outside the right of way.\n\n       Texas Gas has effectively abandoned any effort to challenge the district court’s\napplication of Ohio Revised Code § 5547.03, except on constitutional grounds. Given\n\fNo. 09-3743         Texas Gas Transmissions, LLC v. Butler County                    Page 4\n                    Bd. of Comm’rs, et al.\n\n\nTexas Gas’s concessions with respect to the district court’s order generally and its failure\nto challenge its underpinnings with respect to Butler County’s entitlement to go forward,\nit appears to us that we lack jurisdiction over any remaining issues in this appeal. It is\nwell-settled that a plaintiff alleging an unconstitutional taking of private property by a\ngovernment entity must first exhaust available state remedies, regardless of the nature\nof the taking. River City Capital, LP v. Bd. of County Comm’rs, Clermont Cnty., Ohio,\n491 F.3d 301, 302 (6th Cir. 2007). Although a Takings Clause claim paired with\n42 U.S.C. § 1983 appears to present a clear basis for federal question jurisdiction under\n28 U.S.C. § 1331, “the Supreme Court has ruled that constitutional takings claims are\nnot ripe for federal court review until state compensation procedures, assuming they\nexist and are adequate, have been exhausted.” Id. at 306 (discussing Williamson County\nReg’l Planning Comm’n v. Hamilton Bank of Johnson City, 473 U.S. 172, 195 (1985)).\nBefore exercising jurisdiction over a Takings Clause claim, a federal court must ensure\nthat the relevant state compensation procedures are “reasonable, certain, and adequate.”\nId. at 307 (citations omitted). This Court has held unambiguously that Ohio affords such\na procedure through an action for mandamus to compel a government entity to institute\nappropriation proceedings against the private property owner. Id. (citing Coles v.\nGranville, 448 F.3d 853, 865 (6th Cir. 2006)). This procedure, as set forth in sections\n163.01 to 163.22 of the Ohio Revised Code, must be followed regardless of whether a\nphysical or regulatory taking is at issue. Id. Texas Gas concedes that it has not\ninstituted any such proceedings in state court. “Ripeness is more than a mere procedural\nquestion; it is determinative of jurisdiction. If a claim is unripe, federal courts lack\nsubject matter jurisdiction and the complaint must be dismissed.” Bigelow v. Mich.\nDep’t of Natural Res., 970 F.2d 154, 157 (6th Cir. 1992) (citation omitted). A federal\ncourt must determine whether a claim is ripe for review, “even if neither party has raised\nthis issue.” Id.\n\n        Because we lack jurisdiction to consider whether Butler County’s actions\nconstitute a taking of property for which just compensation must be provided, we\ndismiss Texas Gas’s appeal as it relates to those issues. In all other respects, we affirm.\n\f",

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">126</span></a></span> (1985)). Before exercising jurisdiction over a Takings Clause claim, a federal court must ensure that the relevant state compensation procedures are \"reasonable, certain, and adequate.\" <i>Id.</i> at 307 (citations omitted). This Court has held unambiguously that Ohio affords such a procedure through an action for <i>mandamus</i> to compel a government entity to institute appropriation proceedings against the private property owner. <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>Coles v. Granville,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"794412\"><a href=\"/opinion/794412/edwin-m-coles-lisa-coles-buffalo-prairie-llc-vincent-otrusina-robert-c/\"><span class=\"volume\">448</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">853</span></a></span>, 865 (6th Cir.2006)). This procedure, as set forth in sections 163.01 to 163.22 of the Ohio Revised Code, must be followed regardless of whether a physical or regulatory taking is at issue. <i>Id.</i> Texas Gas concedes that it has not instituted any such proceedings in state court. \"Ripeness is more than a mere procedural question; it is determinative of jurisdiction. If a claim is unripe, federal courts lack subject matter jurisdiction and the complaint must be dismissed.\" <i>Bigelow v. Mich.

A federal court must determine whether a claim is ripe for review, \"even if neither party has raised this issue.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Because we lack jurisdiction to consider whether Butler County's actions constitute a taking of property for which just compensation must be provided, we dismiss <span class=\"star-pagination\">*977</span> Texas Gas's appeal as it relates to those issues. In all other respects, we affirm.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  The Honorable David D.
