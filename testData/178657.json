BACKGROUND\n\n       On May 13, 1993, a jury convicted Watkins of conspiracy to possess with intent\nto distribute cocaine base in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 846. The district court found\nWatkins responsible for transporting 7.7957 kilograms of cocaine base, which resulted\nin a base offense level of forty under the United States Sentencing Guidelines. Watkins\nreceived a two-point enhancement for obstruction of justice and a two-point\nenhancement for his managerial role in the offense, which brought his total offense level\nto forty-four. Under the Guidelines, an offense level greater than forty-three was treated\nas a level forty-three. Coupled with a criminal history category of VI, Watkins’s offense\nlevel produced a Guidelines sentence of life in prison. The district court sentenced\nWatkins to life in prison on September 15. Watkins appealed and this Court affirmed\nthe district court’s sentence. See United States v. Watkins, Nos. 93-4019, 93-4020, 1994\nWL 464193, at *4 (6th Cir. Aug. 26, 1994).\n\n       Later in 1993, the United States Sentencing Commission amended the drug\nquantity table under U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(c).         See U.S.S.G. app. C, amend. 505.\nAmendment 505 lowered the base offense level from forty to thirty-eight for quantities\nof cocaine base equal to or greater than 1.5 kilograms. See U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(c)(1). The\namended drug quantity table reduced Watkins’s base offense level from forty to thirty-\neight. With his enhancements, his total offense level was forty-two, which reduced his\nGuidelines sentencing range from life to between thirty years and life. Following the\nenactment of Amendment 505, Watkins filed three motions pursuant to section\n3582(c)(2) requesting that the district court apply Amendment 505 to his case and\nresentence him to the low end of the Guidelines range. The district court rejected each\nmotion after noting its discretion to grant a reduction and evaluating the 18 U.S.C.\n§ 3553(a) sentencing factors.\n\n       On November 1, 2007, Amendment 706 to the Guidelines went into effect,\nreducing the base offense level for most crack cocaine offenses by two levels. See\nU.S.S.G. supp. to app. C, amend. 706. On March 3, 2008, Amendment 713 went into\n\fNo. 09-3966        United States v. Watkins                                            Page 3\n\n\neffect, giving Amendment 706 retroactive effect. See U.S.S.G. supp. to app. C, amend.\n713.\n\n       On February 25, 2008, Watkins filed a motion for reduction of sentence pursuant\nto section 3582(c)(2) based on Amendment 505, Amendment 706, consideration of the\nsection 3553(a) sentencing factors, and application of United States v. Booker, 543 U.S.\n220 (2005). The district court denied Watkins’s motion. The district court declined to\nconsider a reduction based on Amendment 505 because it had previously denied three\nsimilar motions and it found no justification for a reduction. The district court also\nfound that Watkins’s sentencing range was not affected by Amendment 706 and it thus\nlacked authority to reduce his sentence based on Amendment 706. Watkins appeals.\n\n       II. STATUTORY FRAMEWORK AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n       A district court may modify a defendant’s sentence only as authorized by statute.\nSee United States v. Johnson, 564 F.3d 419, 421 (6th Cir. 2001). Under section\n3582(c)(2), a district court may modify a term of imprisonment:\n\n       in the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of\n       imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been\n       lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 994(o) . . .\n       after considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the extent that\n       they are applicable, if such a reduction is consistent with applicable\n       policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\n\n18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2).\n\n       The Supreme Court has held that section 3582(c) establishes a two-step inquiry.\nSee Dillon v. United States, 130 S. Ct. 2683, 2691 (2010). At step one of the inquiry,\nthe court must determine the defendant’s eligibility for a sentence modification under\nthe Sentencing Commission’s policy statements and the extent of reduction authorized.\nId. The Sentencing Commission has identified the amendments that may apply\nretroactively and the procedure for deciding a motion for reduction of sentence in a\npolicy statement. See U.S.S.G. § 1B1.10. Both Amendment 505 and Amendment 706\nare included in the collection of retroactive amendments listed in section 1B1.10(c) that\n\fNo. 09-3966        United States v. Watkins                                         Page 4\n\n\nmay be considered as a basis for sentence reduction. The court must “determine the\namended guideline range that would have been applicable to the defendant” if the\nrelevant amendment had been in effect at the time of the initial sentencing. Id.\n§ 1B1.10(b)(1). We review de novo a district court’s determination that a defendant is\nineligible for a sentence reduction. See United States v. Curry, 606 F.3d 323, 327 (6th\nCir. 2010).\n\n       If a defendant is eligible for a sentence reduction, then under step two of the\ninquiry the court must consider the section 3553(a) factors and determine whether, in its\ndiscretion, the authorized reduction is warranted under the circumstances. See Dillon,\n130 S. Ct. at 2692. A district court’s decision whether a sentence reduction is warranted\nis reviewed for abuse of discretion. See United States v. Washington, 584 F.3d 693, 695\n(6th Cir. 2009), cert. denied, 130 S. Ct. 3479 (2010). A district court abuses its\ndiscretion when it relies on clearly erroneous findings of fact, applies the law\nimproperly, or applies the incorrect legal standard. Id.\n\n                                   III. ANALYSIS\n\nA. Amendment 505\n\n       First, we find that the district court correctly concluded that Watkins was eligible\nfor a sentence reduction based on Amendment 505 and did not abuse its discretion in\nfinding that a reduction was not warranted.\n\n       The district court correctly concluded that Watkins was eligible for a sentence\nreduction based on Amendment 505. To be eligible for a sentence reduction under\nsection 3582(c)(2), the defendant must have been “sentenced to a term of imprisonment\nbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing\nCommission.” 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2). As discussed above, Amendment 505 lowered\nWatkins’s base offense level from forty to thirty-eight, which reduced his total offense\nlevel from forty-four to forty-two and lowered his Guidelines range from life to between\nthirty years and life. Thus, Watkins was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on\n\fNo. 09-3966         United States v. Watkins                                         Page 5\n\n\na Guidelines range that was subsequently lowered by the Sentencing Commission, and\nthe district court correctly held that Watkins was eligible for a sentence reduction.\n\n        Furthermore, the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that a\nreduction in Watkins’s sentence based on Amendment 505 was not warranted. The\ndecision whether to grant an authorized sentence reduction is discretionary. See Curry,\n606 F.3d at 330. In determining whether to grant an authorized sentence reduction, the\ndistrict court must consider the section 3553(a) factors to the extent that they are\napplicable and the impact on public safety. See U.S.S.G. § 1B1.10, cmt. n.1(B)(i)-(iii).\nIn addition, the court may consider the defendant’s post-sentencing conduct. See id.\nSection 3582(c)(2) proceedings are not full resentencings, and we do not require the\ndistrict court to articulate its analysis of each sentencing factor as long as the record\ndemonstrates that the court considered the relevant factors. See Curry, 606 F.3d at 330-\n31.\n\n        The district court noted that whether to grant a reduction of sentence pursuant to\nsection 3582(c)(2) was within its discretion, and that it was required to consider the\napplicable section 3553(a) factors. The district court reasoned that it would not consider\nany reduction based on Amendment 505 because it had already considered and denied\nthree motions by Watkins to reduce his sentence based on Amendment 505. In each\ncase, the district court denied the motion after considering the section 3553(a) factors,\nincluding the nature and circumstances of the offense, Watkins’s history and\ncharacteristics, the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense\nand to promote respect for the law, whether the sentence provided just punishment for\nthe offense, whether the sentence was an adequate deterrent to criminal conduct, and\nwhether the sentence would protect the public from further crimes by Watkins. In the\nmotion at issue in this case, Watkins did not present any new evidence of post-offense\nrehabilitation or other relevant factors not addressed in previous motions. Although the\ndistrict court stated that it would not consider any reduction based on Amendment 505,\nit also stated that it had reviewed all the documents submitted by Watkins and did not\nfind any justification for reducing his sentence.\n\fNo. 09-3966          United States v. Watkins                                        Page 6\n\n\n        In Curry, this Court could not conclude that the district court abused its\ndiscretion in denying the defendant’s motion for modification of his sentence when the\nrecord had been amply developed before the resentencing motion was filed, the district\ncourt had considered the relevant factors in depth at the original sentencing and\nresentencing, and the district court indicated that it had considered all the relevant\nsection 3553(a) factors. See id. at 331. Similarly, here, the district court had considered\nthe relevant factors in Watkins’s three previous motions, and it indicated that it had\nconsidered the entire record and the section 3553(a) factors. Thus, the district court did\nnot abuse its discretion in denying Watkins’s current motion for reduction pursuant to\nAmendment 505.\n\nB. Amendment 706\n\n        The district court correctly found that Watkins was ineligible for a sentence\nreduction based on Amendment 706 because this Amendment did not reduce Watkins’s\nsentencing range. For a defendant to be eligible for a sentence reduction under section\n3582(c)(2), the reduction must be “consistent with applicable policy statements issued\nby the Sentencing Commission.” 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2). The policy statement\ngoverning section 3582(c)(2) proceedings provides that a reduction in the defendant’s\nterm of imprisonment is not authorized if an “amendment listed in subsection (c) does\nnot have the effect of lowering the defendant’s applicable guideline range.” U.S.S.G.\n§ 1B1.10(a)(2)(B).\n\n        Although Amendment 706 lowered the offense level for most crack cocaine\noffenses, it did not lower Watkins’s applicable Guidelines range. Watkins’s base offense\nlevel was originally forty, then thirty-eight after Amendment 505. Before Amendment\n706, the Guidelines assigned offense level thirty-eight to any quantity of cocaine base\n1.5 kilograms or more. After Amendment 706, the Guidelines apply level thirty-six to\na quantity of 1.5 to 4.5 kilograms cocaine base, and level thirty-eight to a quantity of 4.5\nkilograms or more. Watkins was held responsible for over seven kilograms of cocaine\nbase. Thus, his offense level continues to be thirty-eight after Amendment 706. With\nhis enhancements, Watkins’s adjusted offense level remains at forty-two, and his\n\fNo. 09-3966        United States v. Watkins                                         Page 7\n\n\nGuidelines range remains at 30 years to life. Because Amendment 706 did not lower\nWatkins’s Guidelines range, a reduction in his term of imprisonment is not consistent\nwith the Sentencing Commission policy statement. Id. Thus, the district court correctly\nheld that Watkins is ineligible for a sentence reduction under section 3582(c)(2).\n\n       The bulk of Watkins’s brief is devoted to his argument that permitting a sentence\nreduction under section 3582(c)(2) only when the requirements of section 1B1.10 are\nmet treats the Guidelines as mandatory in violation of Booker, 543 U.S. 220. The\nSupreme Court, however, has recently foreclosed this argument. In Dillon, the Supreme\nCourt held that “[g]iven the limited scope and purpose of § 3582(c)(2), . . . proceedings\nunder that section do not implicate the interests identified in Booker.” Dillon, 130 S. Ct.\nat 2692. Therefore, the Sentencing Commission’s policy statements are mandatory in\nthe sentence-modification context. See United States v. Hameed, No. 09-3259, 2010 WL\n2976048, at *6 (6th Cir. July 26, 2010). Thus, the district court correctly held that\nbecause the requirements of section 1B1.10 were not met in this case, it did not have the\nauthority to permit a sentence reduction under section 3582(c)(2).\n\n       To the extent that Watkins appeals the denial of the sentence reduction under\nsection 3582(c)(2) on Booker reasonableness grounds, we lack jurisdiction to entertain\nthis argument. See United States v. Bowers, 615 F.3d 715, 717 (6th Cir. 2010). Thus,\nwe lack jurisdiction to consider Watkins’s argument that the district court failed to\nconsider disparities that persist between crack and powder cocaine offense sentencing\neven after Amendment 706. See id. at 723 n.6.\n\n                                  IV. CONCLUSION\n\n       The district court’s denial of Watkins’s motion for reduced sentence is\nAFFIRMED.\n\f",

BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>On May 13, 1993, a jury convicted Watkins of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine base in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 846. The district court found Watkins responsible for transporting 7.7957 kilograms of cocaine base, which resulted in a base offense level of forty under the United States Sentencing Guidelines. Watkins received a two-point enhancement for obstruction of justice and a two-point enhancement for his managerial role in the offense, which brought his total offense level to forty-four. Under the Guidelines, an offense level greater than forty-three was treated as a level forty-three. Coupled with a criminal history category of VI, Watkins's offense level produced a Guidelines sentence of life in prison. The district court sentenced Watkins to life in prison on September 15. Watkins appealed and this Court affirmed the district court's sentence. <i>See United States v. Watkins,</i> Nos. 93-4019, 93-4020, 1994 WL 464193, at *4 (6th Cir. Aug. 26, 1994).</p>\n<p>Later in 1993, the United States Sentencing Commission amended the drug quantity table under U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(c). <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. app. C, amend. 505. Amendment 505 lowered the base offense level from forty to thirty-eight for quantities of cocaine base equal to or greater than 1.5 kilograms. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(c)(1). The amended drug quantity table reduced Watkins's base offense level from forty to thirty-eight. With his enhancements, his total offense level was forty-two, which reduced his Guidelines sentencing range from life to between thirty years and life. Following the enactment of Amendment 505, Watkins filed three motions pursuant to section 3582(c)(2) requesting that the district court apply Amendment 505 to his case and resentence him to the low end of the Guidelines range. The district court rejected each motion after noting its discretion to grant a reduction and evaluating the 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) sentencing factors.</p>\n<p>On November 1, 2007, Amendment 706 to the Guidelines went into effect, reducing the base offense level for most crack cocaine offenses by two levels. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. supp. to app. C, amend. 706. On March 3, 2008, Amendment 713 went into effect, giving Amendment 706 retroactive effect. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. supp. to app. C, amend. 713.</p>\n<p>On February 25, 2008, Watkins filed a motion for reduction of sentence pursuant to section 3582(c)(2) based on Amendment 505, Amendment 706, consideration of the section 3553(a) sentencing factors, and application of <i>United States v. Booker,</i> 543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). The district court denied Watkins's motion. The district court declined to consider a reduction based on Amendment 505 because it had previously denied three similar motions and it found no justification <span class=\"star-pagination\">*280</span> for a reduction. The district court also found that Watkins's sentencing range was not affected by Amendment 706 and it thus lacked authority to reduce his sentence based on Amendment 706. Watkins appeals.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. STATUTORY FRAMEWORK AND STANDARD OF REVIEW</h2>\n<p>A district court may modify a defendant's sentence only as authorized by statute. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Johnson,</i> 564 F.3d 419, 421 (6th Cir.2009). Under section 3582(c)(2), a district court may modify a term of imprisonment:</p>\n<blockquote>in the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 994(o) ... after considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable, if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.</blockquote>\n<p>18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court has held that section 3582(c) establishes a two-step inquiry. <i>See </i><i>Dillon v. United States,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2691, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010). At step one of the inquiry, the court must determine the defendant's eligibility for a sentence modification under the Sentencing Commission's policy statements and the extent of reduction authorized. <i>Id.</i> The Sentencing Commission has identified the amendments that may apply retroactively and the procedure for deciding a motion for reduction of sentence in a policy statement. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. § 1B1.10. Both Amendment 505 and Amendment 706 are included in the collection of retroactive amendments listed in section 1B1.10(c) that may be considered as a basis for sentence reduction. The court must \"determine the amended guideline range that would have been applicable to the defendant\" if the relevant amendment had been in effect at the time of the initial sentencing. <i>Id.</i> § 1B1.10(b)(1). We review <i>de novo</i> a district court's determination that a defendant is ineligible for a sentence reduction. <i>See </i><i>United States v.

A district court's decision whether a sentence reduction is warranted is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <i>See </i><i>United States v.

Amendment 505</h2>\n<p>First, we find that the district court correctly concluded that Watkins was eligible for a sentence reduction based on Amendment 505 and did not abuse its discretion in finding that a reduction was not warranted.</p>\n<p>The district court correctly concluded that Watkins was eligible for a sentence reduction based on Amendment 505. To be eligible for a sentence reduction under section 3582(c)(2), the defendant must have been \"sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered <span class=\"star-pagination\">*281</span> by the Sentencing Commission.\" 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2). As discussed above, Amendment 505 lowered Watkins's base offense level from forty to thirty-eight, which reduced his total offense level from forty-four to forty-two and lowered his Guidelines range from life to between thirty years and life. Thus, Watkins was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a Guidelines range that was subsequently lowered by the Sentencing Commission, and the district court correctly held that Watkins was eligible for a sentence reduction.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that a reduction in Watkins's sentence based on Amendment 505 was not warranted. The decision whether to grant an authorized sentence reduction is discretionary. <i>See </i><i>Curry,</i> 606 F.3d at 330. In determining whether to grant an authorized sentence reduction, the district court must consider the section 3553(a) factors to the extent that they are applicable and the impact on public safety. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. § 1B1.10, cmt. n.1(B)(i)-(iii). In addition, the court may consider the defendant's post-sentencing conduct. <i>See id.</i> Section 3582(c)(2) proceedings are not full resentencings, and we do not require the district court to articulate its analysis of each sentencing factor as long as the record demonstrates that the court considered the relevant factors. <i>See </i><i>Curry,</i> 606 F.3d at 330-31.</p>\n<p>The district court noted that whether to grant a reduction of sentence pursuant to section 3582(c)(2) was within its discretion, and that it was required to consider the applicable section 3553(a) factors. The district court reasoned that it would not consider any reduction based on Amendment 505 because it had already considered and denied three motions by Watkins to reduce his sentence based on Amendment 505. In each case, the district court denied the motion after considering the section 3553(a) factors, including the nature and circumstances of the offense, Watkins's history and characteristics, the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense and to promote respect for the law, whether the sentence provided just punishment for the offense, whether the sentence was an adequate deterrent to criminal conduct, and whether the sentence would protect the public from further crimes by Watkins. In the motion at issue in this case, Watkins did not present any new evidence of post-offense rehabilitation or other relevant factors not addressed in previous motions. Although the district court stated that it would not consider any reduction based on Amendment 505, it also stated that it had reviewed all the documents submitted by Watkins and did not find any justification for reducing his sentence.</p>\n<p>In <i>Curry,</i> this Court could not conclude that the district court abused its discretion in denying the defendant's motion for modification of his sentence when the record had been amply developed before the resentencing motion was filed, the district court had considered the relevant factors in depth at the original sentencing and resentencing, and the district court indicated that it had considered all the relevant section 3553(a) factors. <i>See id.</i> at 331. Similarly, here, the district court had considered the relevant factors in Watkins's three previous motions, and it indicated that it had considered the entire record and the section 3553(a) factors. Thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Watkins's current motion for reduction pursuant to Amendment 505.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Amendment 706</h2>\n<p>The district court correctly found that Watkins was ineligible for a sentence <span class=\"star-pagination\">*282</span> reduction based on Amendment 706 because this Amendment did not reduce Watkins's sentencing range. For a defendant to be eligible for a sentence reduction under section 3582(c)(2), the reduction must be \"consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\" 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2). The policy statement governing section 3582(c)(2) proceedings provides that a reduction in the defendant's term of imprisonment is not authorized if an \"amendment listed in subsection (c) does not have the effect of lowering the defendant's applicable guideline range.\" U.S.S.G. § 1B1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p>Although Amendment 706 lowered the offense level for most crack cocaine offenses, it did not lower Watkins's applicable Guidelines range. Watkins's base offense level was originally forty, then thirty-eight after Amendment 505. Before Amendment 706, the Guidelines assigned offense level thirty-eight to any quantity of cocaine base 1.5 kilograms or more. After Amendment 706, the Guidelines apply level thirty-six to a quantity of 1.5 to 4.5 kilograms cocaine base, and level thirty-eight to a quantity of 4.5 kilograms or more. Watkins was held responsible for over seven kilograms of cocaine base. Thus, his offense level continues to be thirty-eight after Amendment 706. With his enhancements, Watkins's adjusted offense level remains at forty-two, and his Guidelines range remains at 30 years to life. Because Amendment 706 did not lower Watkins's Guidelines range, a reduction in his term of imprisonment is not consistent with the Sentencing Commission policy statement. <i>Id.</i> Thus, the district court correctly held that Watkins is ineligible for a sentence reduction under section 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p>The bulk of Watkins's brief is devoted to his argument that permitting a sentence reduction under section 3582(c)(2) only when the requirements of section 1B1.10 are met treats the Guidelines as mandatory in violation of <i>Booker,</i> 543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738. The Supreme Court, however, has recently foreclosed this argument. In <i>Dillon,</i> the Supreme Court held that \"[g]iven the limited scope and purpose of § 3582(c)(2), ... proceedings under that section do not implicate the interests identified in <i>Booker.</i>\" <i>Dillon,</i> 130 S.Ct. at 2692. Therefore, the Sentencing Commission's policy statements are mandatory in the sentence-modification context. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Hameed,</i> 614 F.3d 259, 265 (6th Cir.2010). Thus, the district court correctly held that because the requirements of section 1B1.10 were not met in this case, it did not have the authority to permit a sentence reduction under section 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p>To the extent that Watkins appeals the denial of the sentence reduction under section 3582(c)(2) on <i>Booker</i> reasonableness grounds, we lack jurisdiction to entertain this argument. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Bowers,</i> 615 F.3d 715, 717 (6th Cir.2010). Thus, we lack jurisdiction to consider Watkins's argument that the district court failed to consider disparities that persist between crack and powder cocaine offense sentencing even after Amendment 706. <i>See id.</i> at 723 n. 6.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV.

Hunt, Assistant United States Attorney, Cincinnati, Ohio, for Appellee.</p>\n<p>Before: MARTIN, COLE, and CLAY, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>OPINION</h2>\n<p>BOYCE F. MARTIN, JR., Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>Defendant-appellant Vincent Watkins appeals the district court's denial of a sentence reduction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2). We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>On May 13, 1993, a jury convicted Watkins of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine base in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 846. The district court found Watkins responsible for transporting 7.7957 kilograms of cocaine base, which resulted in a base offense level of forty under the United States Sentencing Guidelines. Watkins received a two-point enhancement for obstruction of justice and a two-point enhancement for his managerial role in the offense, which brought his total offense level to forty-four. Under the Guidelines, an offense level greater than forty-three was treated as a level forty-three. Coupled with a criminal history category of VI, Watkins's offense level produced a Guidelines sentence of life in prison. The district court sentenced Watkins to life in prison on September 15. Watkins appealed and this Court affirmed the district court's sentence. <i>See United States v. Watkins,</i> Nos. 93-4019, 93-4020, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1994</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">464193</span></span>, at *4 (6th Cir. Aug. 26, 1994).</p>\n<p>Later in 1993, the United States Sentencing Commission amended the drug quantity table under U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(c). <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. app. C, amend. 505. Amendment 505 lowered the base offense level from forty to thirty-eight for quantities of cocaine base equal to or greater than 1.5 kilograms. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(c)(1). The amended drug quantity table reduced Watkins's base offense level from forty to thirty-eight. With his enhancements, his total offense level was forty-two, which reduced his Guidelines sentencing range from life to between thirty years and life. Following the enactment of Amendment 505, Watkins filed three motions pursuant to section 3582(c)(2) requesting that the district court apply Amendment 505 to his case and resentence him to the low end of the Guidelines range. The district court rejected each motion after noting its discretion to grant a reduction and evaluating the 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) sentencing factors.</p>\n<p>On November 1, 2007, Amendment 706 to the Guidelines went into effect, reducing the base offense level for most crack cocaine offenses by two levels. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. supp. to app. C, amend. 706. On March 3, 2008, Amendment 713 went into effect, giving Amendment 706 retroactive effect. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. supp. to app. C, amend. 713.</p>\n<p>On February 25, 2008, Watkins filed a motion for reduction of sentence pursuant to section 3582(c)(2) based on Amendment 505, Amendment 706, consideration of the section 3553(a) sentencing factors, and application of <i>United States v. Booker,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">738</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">160</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">621</span></span> (2005). The district court denied Watkins's motion. The district court declined to consider a reduction based on Amendment 505 because it had previously denied three similar motions and it found no justification <span class=\"star-pagination\">*280</span> for a reduction. The district court also found that Watkins's sentencing range was not affected by Amendment 706 and it thus lacked authority to reduce his sentence based on Amendment 706. Watkins appeals.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. STATUTORY FRAMEWORK AND STANDARD OF REVIEW</h2>\n<p>A district court may modify a defendant's sentence only as authorized by statute. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Johnson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1192652\"><a href=\"/opinion/1192652/united-states-v-johnson/\"><span class=\"volume\">564</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">419</span></a></span>, 421 (6th Cir.2009). Under section 3582(c)(2), a district court may modify a term of imprisonment:</p>\n<blockquote>in the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 994(o) ... after considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable, if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.</blockquote>\n<p>18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court has held that section 3582(c) establishes a two-step inquiry. <i>See </i><i>Dillon v. United States,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"148795\"><a href=\"/opinion/148795/dillon-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2683</span></a></span>, 2691, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"148795\"><a href=\"/opinion/148795/dillon-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">177</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">271</span></a></span> (2010). At step one of the inquiry, the court must determine the defendant's eligibility for a sentence modification under the Sentencing Commission's policy statements and the extent of reduction authorized. <i>Id.</i> The Sentencing Commission has identified the amendments that may apply retroactively and the procedure for deciding a motion for reduction of sentence in a policy statement. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. § 1B1.10. Both Amendment 505 and Amendment 706 are included in the collection of retroactive amendments listed in section 1B1.10(c) that may be considered as a basis for sentence reduction. The court must \"determine the amended guideline range that would have been applicable to the defendant\" if the relevant amendment had been in effect at the time of the initial sentencing. <i>Id.</i> § 1B1.10(b)(1). We review <i>de novo</i> a district court's determination that a defendant is ineligible for a sentence reduction. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Curry,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1433371\"><a href=\"/opinion/1433371/united-states-v-curry/\"><span class=\"volume\">606</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">323</span></a></span>, 327 (6th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p>If a defendant is eligible for a sentence reduction, then under step two of the inquiry the court must consider the section 3553(a) factors and determine whether, in its discretion, the authorized reduction is warranted under the circumstances. <i>See </i><i>Dillon,</i> 130 S.Ct. at 2692. A district court's decision whether a sentence reduction is warranted is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Washington,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1436059\"><a href=\"/opinion/1436059/united-states-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">584</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">693</span></a></span>, 695 (6th Cir. 2009), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">3479</span></span>, ___ L.Ed.2d ___ (2010). A district court abuses its discretion when it relies on clearly erroneous findings of fact, applies the law improperly, or applies the incorrect legal standard. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. ANALYSIS</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Amendment 505</h2>\n<p>First, we find that the district court correctly concluded that Watkins was eligible for a sentence reduction based on Amendment 505 and did not abuse its discretion in finding that a reduction was not warranted.</p>\n<p>The district court correctly concluded that Watkins was eligible for a sentence reduction based on Amendment 505. To be eligible for a sentence reduction under section 3582(c)(2), the defendant must have been \"sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered <span class=\"star-pagination\">*281</span> by the Sentencing Commission.\" 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2). As discussed above, Amendment 505 lowered Watkins's base offense level from forty to thirty-eight, which reduced his total offense level from forty-four to forty-two and lowered his Guidelines range from life to between thirty years and life. Thus, Watkins was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a Guidelines range that was subsequently lowered by the Sentencing Commission, and the district court correctly held that Watkins was eligible for a sentence reduction.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that a reduction in Watkins's sentence based on Amendment 505 was not warranted. The decision whether to grant an authorized sentence reduction is discretionary. <i>See </i><i>Curry,</i> 606 F.3d at 330. In determining whether to grant an authorized sentence reduction, the district court must consider the section 3553(a) factors to the extent that they are applicable and the impact on public safety. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. § 1B1.10, cmt. n.1(B)(i)-(iii). In addition, the court may consider the defendant's post-sentencing conduct. <i>See id.</i> Section 3582(c)(2) proceedings are not full resentencings, and we do not require the district court to articulate its analysis of each sentencing factor as long as the record demonstrates that the court considered the relevant factors. <i>See </i><i>Curry,</i> 606 F.3d at 330-31.</p>\n<p>The district court noted that whether to grant a reduction of sentence pursuant to section 3582(c)(2) was within its discretion, and that it was required to consider the applicable section 3553(a) factors.

Amendment 706</h2>\n<p>The district court correctly found that Watkins was ineligible for a sentence <span class=\"star-pagination\">*282</span> reduction based on Amendment 706 because this Amendment did not reduce Watkins's sentencing range.
