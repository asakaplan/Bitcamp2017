Paul Monea and a coconspirator were\nconvicted of participating in a money-laundering scheme to hide the proceeds of drug\ntrafficking. The district court subsequently granted a preliminary order of forfeiture\nregarding several items of personal property used in the scheme, including a large\ndiamond that purportedly belonged to Monea. Several parties filed petitions to amend\nthe order of forfeiture on the basis of their alleged ownership interest in the diamond,\nincluding the Monea Family Trust I–1999 (the Trust), of which Monea and two of his\nchildren were beneficiaries. Holding that the government’s interest in the diamond was\nsuperior to that of all of the claimants, the district court denied the various petitions.\n\n        The Trust now appeals the district court’s order. For the following reasons, we\nAFFIRM the judgment of the district court.\n\n                                  I. BACKGROUND\n\nA.      Factual background\n\n        The Trust was established in 1999 by Deborah Douglas, who named as\nbeneficiaries her children, Blake and Brook Monea, and her then-husband, Paul Monea\n(hereinafter referred to as Monea). John Tuggle, a business acquaintance of Monea, was\nappointed as trustee. Under the terms of the Trust Agreement, the trustee could be\nremoved by Monea or by a majority vote of all of the beneficiaries. Monea also had the\nsingular authority to appoint new trustees. The Trust was initially funded with $1,000,\nbut later acquired ownership of a home near Warren, Ohio that was previously owned\nby former boxer Mike Tyson.\n\n        In 2005, Monea completed a term of imprisonment that he had been serving for\nan unrelated tax-evasion conviction. Upon his release, Monea discovered that Tuggle\n\fNo. 09-3730        United States v. Monea Family Trust I et al.                  Page 3\n\n\nhad misappropriated well in excess of $100,000 of Trust funds. This caused Monea to\nremove Tuggle as the trustee in November 2005.\n\n       Tuggle’s replacement died unexpectedly soon after being appointed. Monea then\nasked Michael Miller, an acquaintance of Monea’s who owned a car dealership, to serve\nas the trustee. During the subsequent months, Miller introduced Monea to John Rizzo,\na sales broker for whom Miller was laundering drug money. Unbeknownst to either\nMiller or Monea, Rizzo was actually an undercover agent with the Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation (FBI).\n\n       Monea and Rizzo first met on March 30, 2006 to discuss the possibility of Rizzo\nsupplying cash for some of Monea’s business ventures. The two men met again on May\n19, 2006 in Los Angeles, California. During this meeting, which Rizzo recorded, Monea\nmentioned “a diamond that I own,” although he did not seek Rizzo’s assistance in selling\nit at the time. The diamond to which Monea referred is a 43.51 Carat Modified\nRectangular Brilliant Yellow Diamond Internally Flawless with Fancy Intense Grate\nknown as the “Golden Eye.” There is no clear evidence of how Monea first came to\npossess the diamond, but he told others involved in this case that he owned a diamond\nmine in Africa and that he received the diamond from a friend.\n\n       Prior to being imprisoned for tax evasion, Monea had borrowed $500,000 from\na man named Michael Dillard, who owned a pawn shop in Oklahoma. Monea used the\nmoney to pay taxes that he had owed. He left the diamond in Dillard’s possession as\ncollateral for the loan. Around the time that Monea first met Rizzo, he borrowed another\n$500,000 from an acquaintance named Gerald Deleo to pay off the Dillard loan and\nreacquire the diamond. Deleo also gave Monea an additional $30,000 shortly thereafter\nto have the diamond readied for sale by gemologists in New York. Monea led Deleo to\nbelieve that the latter would receive an ownership interest in the diamond in exchange\nfor the monies advanced. Deleo had the diamond in his possession for two to three\nweeks sometime after it was readied for sale, during which time Deleo unsuccessfully\nsearched for a potential buyer.\n\fNo. 09-3730        United States v. Monea Family Trust I et al.                   Page 4\n\n\n        In June 2006, Miller, in his capacity as trustee, appointed an acquaintance named\nDavid Ramsey as an agent of the Trust for the limited purpose of retrieving the diamond\nfrom a jeweler in Oklahoma who was holding the diamond on behalf of Dillard. This\narrangement was made, according to Miller, so that the “paper trail” showed “that the\ntrust bought the stone for $500,000.” Monea and Rizzo spoke shortly after Ramsey\nretrieved the diamond, but Monea again did not ask Rizzo for help in finding a buyer for\nthe gemstone.\n\n        In August and September 2006, Monea and Ramsey engaged in discussions with\nrepresentatives from the Charity Fellowship of Truth Church, located in Avon, New\nYork, regarding the purchase of a lake house in Massillon, Ohio. Monea had rented the\nhouse in the past and had used it to host business associates while negotiating contracts\nand discussing his various entrepreneurial ventures. But by August 2006, the home was\nin danger of going into foreclosure. Pursuant to the purchase agreement, the church\nwould buy the lake house from its current owners for approximately $2.5 million. The\nTrust then agreed to purchase the home from the church for $3 million within one year\nthereafter.\n\n        To secure the Trust’s obligation to ultimately buy the home, the church was to\nreceive a 50 percent interest in the diamond, as memorialized in a separate “Certificate\nof Giving” signed on the same day as the purchase agreement. According to the\npurchase agreement, the diamond would be sold, with the proceeds from the sale to first\nbe used to buy the lake house from the church for $3 million. The remaining balance\nfrom the sale of the diamond would belong to the Trust.\n\n        Church representatives present during these discussions testified that Monea and\nRamsey conveyed the impression that the diamond belonged to the Trust and that\nRamsey was acting as the Trust’s agent. They further stated that Miller was present at\na Canton, Ohio country club where both the purchase agreement and the Certificate of\nGiving were signed in September 2006. Miller acknowledged meeting the church\nrepresentatives at his home earlier on the day in question. Although Miller never\ntestified as to whether he was present at the country club when the documents were\n\fNo. 09-3730        United States v. Monea Family Trust I et al.                     Page 5\n\n\nsigned, he denied participating in any negotiations between the church and Monea and\nmaintained that he was never informed of any agreement reached by the two parties.\nMoreover, Miller said that he had not authorized Ramsey to act on behalf of the Trust\nbeyond retrieving the diamond from Dillard’s jeweler in Oklahoma. Ramsey, however,\nsigned both documents on behalf of the Trust, and Monea signed the purchase agreement\nas an “acting Trustee” for the Charity Fellowship of Truth Church.\n\n       Following these negotiations, Monea, Ramsey, and Reverend David Moore from\nthe church took the diamond to Los Angeles and Las Vegas to show to potential buyers.\nDuring part of this time, Reverend Moore had the diamond in his possession without\neither Monea or Ramsey being present. Miller was never informed that these showings\nwere taking place or that Reverend Moore at times had sole custody of the diamond.\n\n       That fall, Miller and Monea continued their efforts to sell the diamond, with\nMiller hiring at least two different brokers in October 2006 to assist them in finding a\nbuyer. Miller and Monea met with Rizzo again on October 17, 2006. This time their\ndiscussion, which Rizzo recorded, revolved around Rizzo finding a buyer to purchase\nthe diamond for $15 million. During their conversation, Monea maintained that he was\n“just trying to sell on behalf of the trust an asset that the trust has.” Miller added that\nany money from the sale was “going in the trust.”\n\n       In early November 2006, Monea and Rizzo reached an agreement in which\nMonea agreed to sell the diamond to drug dealers who Rizzo knew in exchange for $19.5\nmillion and a boat. Discussions regarding commissions, the payment of earnest money,\nand the wiring of funds continued through mid-December. Monea typically handled\nthese negotiations, with little meaningful involvement from Miller, and he met with\nRizzo on one occasion in Las Vegas without Miller being present. On another occasion\nin November 2006, when Monea believed that he was nearing the close of a deal, he told\na potential buyer that “I think I got my diamond sold.”\n\n       Monea also gave Miller a list detailing how the proceeds of the sale were to be\ndisbursed. A majority of the payments to be made were unrelated to either the debts or\n\fNo. 09-3730        United States v. Monea Family Trust I et al.                    Page 6\n\n\ninvestments of the Trust, and several payments were to be used to discharge personal\ndebts incurred by Monea.\n\n       On December 13, 2006, Monea, Miller, and Rizzo met at the office of the Trust’s\nlawyer, Jack Morrison, to complete the sale of the diamond. Morrison had prepared\nseveral documents to complete the transaction, including a bill of sale, an\nacknowledgment and receipt, and a tax return, all of which indicated that the Trust\nowned the diamond. At the close of the meeting, Miller and Monea were arrested by the\nFBI.\n\nB.     Procedural background\n\n       A grand jury charged Monea with one count of conspiracy to launder money, in\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 1956(h), and three counts of money laundering, in violation of\n18 U.S.C. § 1956(a). Miller was charged with one count of conspiracy to launder money\nand 36 counts of money laundering. The superseding indictment also sought forfeiture\nof several pieces of personal property and real estate used in the money-laundering\nscheme, including the diamond.\n\n       Following a jury trial, Monea was convicted on all four counts and was sentenced\nto 150 months’ imprisonment. The jury also found that the diamond was involved in the\nfour counts with which Monea was charged. For his part in the scheme, Miller pled\nguilty pursuant to a plea agreement and was sentenced to 57 months’ imprisonment.\n\n       In June 2007, the district court entered a preliminary order of forfeiture that\nauthorized the government to seize various properties used in the money-laundering\nscheme, including the diamond. Several parties, including the Charity Fellowship of\nTruth Church, Deleo, and the Trust, filed petitions seeking to establish ownership of the\ndiamond. After the court denied the government’s motion to dismiss all but one of the\npetitions, it held a three-day forfeiture hearing in October 2007.\n\n       During the hearing, several witnesses testified that the diamond was a Trust asset.\nMiller, as well as the current trustee, Nancy McCann, both testified that the Trust owned\nthe diamond. Blake Monea similarly testified that he had always understood that the\n\fNo. 09-3730         United States v. Monea Family Trust I et al.                     Page 7\n\n\ndiamond belonged to the Trust. None of these witnesses, however, were able to identify\nany document that established the Trust’s ownership of the diamond. Furthermore, both\nMiller and Blake Monea testified that they arrived at their conclusions regarding the\nTrust’s ownership based solely on representations made by Paul Monea.\n\n        Other evidence introduced at the hearing indicated that the Trust did not own the\ndiamond. Tuggle testified that the diamond never became a trust asset while he was\nserving as trustee. John Tanza, the undercover agent posing as Rizzo, likewise testified\nthat when he first discussed finding a buyer for the diamond, Monea stated that the\ndiamond was his. Also undercutting the Trust’s claim of ownership was an affidavit of\nPaul A. Monea (one of Monea’s sons) that was filed in a bankruptcy case involving the\nson’s business. In the affidavit, Paul A. Monea stated that “[t]o the best of my\nknowledge the diamond was and is owned by Paul M. Monea, my father, in his\nindividual capacity.”\n\n        The legitimacy of the Trust was also called into doubt at the hearing. Tuggle, for\nexample, conceded that when he was trustee, Monea had him “step and fetch and do\nwhatever [Monea] said.” The Trust, Tuggle further admitted, was in reality Monea’s\n“private slush fund[].” Tanza similarly testified that, based on his conversations with\nMonea and Miller, “the reason for the trust was to protect the assets of Mr. Monea from\nany type of attack from either legal or civil actions.”\n\n        As for Miller, in describing his role as trustee, he stated that he was not involved\nin the negotiations with brokers to sell the diamond and would simply sign whatever\nbroker agreements that Monea presented. Miller also testified that Monea directed him\nto sign a document designating Ramsey as an agent of the Trust for the purpose of\npicking up the diamond from Dillard’s jeweler in Oklahoma. He further recalled that he\n“never had the diamond in my possession, ever”; instead, Monea usually carried the\ndiamond in a velvet bag in his pants pocket, although Ramsey would “sometimes” carry\nit in his pocket.\n\n        Following the hearing, the district court denied all of the petitions seeking\nownership of the diamond. Specifically, the court found that the government’s interest\n\fNo. 09-3730         United States v. Monea Family Trust I et al.                      Page 8\n\n\nin the diamond vested on March 30, 2006, the date on which Monea first spoke with\nRizzo, because that was when the conspiracy first began. The court further concluded\nthat Monea never “surrendered ownership and control of the diamond” to the Trust and\nthat he “always treated the diamond as his own, despite his representations that it was\nan asset of the estate.” Moreover, the court questioned the validity of the Trust.\nAlthough the court declined to make a formal ruling, it noted that “there is strong\nevidence that the Trust itself was a sham.” Finally, the court held that none of the other\nclaimants had established an interest in the diamond superior to that of the government’s.\nThis timely appeal of the district court’s order, brought by the Trust only, followed.\n\n                                      II. ANALYSIS\n\nA.      Standard of review\n\n        We review de novo a district court’s interpretation of federal forfeiture law.\nUnited States v. Jones, 502 F.3d 388, 391 (6th Cir. 2007). Although findings of fact are\nreviewed under the clear-error standard, “[t]he issue of whether those facts are sufficient\nto constitute a proper criminal forfeiture is reviewed de novo.” Id.\n\nB.      The Trust’s interest in the diamond\n\n        Pursuant to 21 U.S.C. § 853(n)(6), a district court can amend an order of\nforfeiture in only two circumstances. The first of these circumstances is where “the\npetitioner has a legal right, title, or interest in the property” that “was vested in the\npetitioner . . . or was superior to any right, title, or interest of the defendant at the time\nof the commission of the acts which gave rise to the forfeiture of the property.” Id.\n§ 853(n)(6)(A). Amending an order of forfeiture is also appropriate where “the\npetitioner is a bona fide purchaser for value of the right, title, or interest of the property\nand was at the time of purchase reasonably without cause to believe that the property\nwas subject to forfeiture under such section.” Id. § 853(n)(6)(B).\n\n        To succeed on a petition to amend a forfeiture order, a claimant must establish\nownership by a preponderance of evidence. Id. § 853(n)(6). The Trust does not argue\nthat it was a bona fide purchaser of the diamond, so we need address only whether the\n\fNo. 09-3730         United States v. Monea Family Trust I et al.                      Page 9\n\n\nTrust had a vested interest in the diamond when the acts giving rise to the money-\nlaundering conspiracy occurred. Both parties agree that Ohio law governs. We must\ntherefore determine (1) whether the Trust had a legal right, title, or interest in the\ndiamond, and (2) if so, whether that right, title, or interest vested prior to the government\nobtaining its interest.\n\n        Turning to the first issue, we note that there is no dispute that the first person to\npossess the diamond among all of the interested parties was Monea. There is also no\nevidence of any document granting the Trust an ownership interest in the diamond. In\nlight of these facts, the district court limited its analysis to whether Monea had gifted the\ndiamond to the Trust, thereby implying that this was the only remaining method that\ncould have resulted in the transfer of ownership from Monea to the Trust. Neither side\nhas indicated that any other method of transfer occurred.\n\n        Two conditions must be met under Ohio law for a gift to be made. First, there\nmust be “an intention on the part of the donor to transfer the title and right of possession\nof the particular property to the donee.” Bolles v. Toledo Trust Co., 4 N.E.2d 917, 920\n(Ohio 1936). Second, there must be “a delivery by the donor to the donee of the subject-\nmatter of the gift to the extent practicable or possible considering its nature, with\nrelinquishment of ownership, dominion, and control over it.” Id. Each of these\nconditions must be supported by clear and convincing evidence. Id. Because this\nstandard is higher than that for establishing an ownership interest under 21 U.S.C.\n§ 853(n)(6), a finding that Monea gifted the diamond to the Trust would necessarily\nresult in a finding that the Trust has an ownership interest in the diamond.\n\n        Regarding the question of donative intent, the district court concluded that, “[a]t\nbest, . . . Monea’s repeated assertions that the diamond was an asset of the Trust”\nevidenced his intent to make a gift to the Trust. Neither party has challenged the court’s\nruling in this regard.\n\n        We therefore turn our attention to the second element—whether Monea delivered\nthe diamond to the Trust by relinquishing ownership, dominion, and control over it. The\nTrust contends that such delivery took place when Ramsey picked up the diamond from\n\fNo. 09-3730        United States v. Monea Family Trust I et al.                  Page 10\n\n\nthe jeweler in Oklahoma because Ramsey was acting as an agent of the Trust at that\ntime. Once Ramsey retrieved the diamond, however, he never gave it to the Trust.\nRather, Monea permitted Deleo to have the diamond for two to three weeks while\nshopping it to potential buyers. There is no evidence that the Trust approved or was ever\naware of this arrangement.\n\n       Upon repossessing the diamond, Monea typically carried it in his pants pocket,\nwith Ramsey “sometimes” doing the same. On the other hand, Miller, then serving as\nthe trustee, never had the diamond in his possession and had no input “on where the\ndiamond would go and where it would be.” The fact that Monea and Ramsey never\nsurrendered possession of the diamond to the trustee weighs strongly against a finding\nof delivery to the Trust. See LCP Holding Co. v. Taylor, 817 N.E.2d 439, 445 (Ohio Ct.\nApp. 2004) (holding that “delivery occurred when appellee surrendered possession of\nthe stock and endorsed the stock to his children as owners”).\n\n       In addition to not surrendering possession of the diamond, Monea continued to\nkeep it for his personal use. He promised Deleo an interest in the diamond in exchange\nfor money to pay off Monea’s debt to Dillard and to have the diamond readied for sale.\nSoon thereafter, Monea and Ramsey entered into a Certificate of Giving with Charity\nFellowship of Truth Church that granted the church a 50 percent security interest in the\ndiamond. Although Ramsey stated in the Certificate that he was acting on behalf of the\nTrust, Miller denied any knowledge of the church obtaining an interest in the diamond\nor that Monea and Ramsey were even participating in such negotiations. Miller was also\nnever informed that Monea, Ramsey, and Reverend Moore were showing the diamond\nto potential buyers in Los Angeles and Las Vegas or that Reverend Moore at times had\nsole custody of the diamond.\n\n       The Trust defends these actions by claiming that both Monea and Ramsey were\nacting as agents of the Trust, but we find this argument unpersuasive. There is no\nevidence in the record that the Trust ever appointed Monea to be an agent or entrusted\nhim with the diamond in any other capacity. In fact, the only evidence that Monea was\nnegotiating on behalf of any party is when he signed the purchase agreement as a trustee\n\fNo. 09-3730        United States v. Monea Family Trust I et al.                   Page 11\n\n\nof the church. And although documentation exists appointing Ramsey as an agent of the\nTrust, it specifically limited his authority to “the purpose of delivering $500,000 (Five\nHundred Thousand Dollars) payment to Mike Dillard and the receipt of any material at\nthe time of payment.” Monea and Ramsey then proceeded to engage in negotiations to\nsell the diamond not only without the Trust’s knowledge, but also well beyond any scope\nof agency that either potentially had with the Trust.\n\n       The evidence also shows that the primary beneficiary of these negotiations was\nto be Monea himself rather than the Trust. Monea sought ownership of the Massillon\nlake house so that he could continue to entertain business clients at the residence, and\nthe majority of the proceeds from the planned December 2006 sale of the diamond was\nearmarked for Monea’s personal debts and investments. He even referred to the\ngemstone as “my diamond” on at least one occasion during conversations with potential\nbuyers. And because Monea continued to use the diamond for his own purposes and did\nnot surrender possession of it, delivery of the diamond to the Trust never occurred.\n\n       The Trust nevertheless contends that testimony from the forfeiture hearing\nregarding its ownership of the diamond was unrebutted and therefore conclusively\nestablishes that the diamond was a Trust asset. To support this assertion, the Trust relies\nupon Howard v. Himmelrick, No. 03AP-1034, 2004 WL 1405293 (Ohio Ct. App. June\n24, 2004). In Howard, the fiancée of a recently deceased man sued to recover\npossession of several pieces of personal property located in the man’s home when he\ndied, but which she claimed were hers. Following a hearing, the trial court determined\nthat the property belonged to the fiancée. The man’s children, who had refused to\nsurrender possession of the items, argued on appeal that this ruling was against the\nmanifest weight of the evidence. Although the only evidence that the fiancée had\nretained ownership of the property was her own testimony, there was no other evidence\nrefuting her statements. The Ohio Court of Appeals held that such unrebutted testimony\nwas “competent and credible evidence” of ownership and, accordingly, that the trial\ncourt’s ruling was not against the manifest weight of the evidence. Id. at *3.\n\fNo. 09-3730         United States v. Monea Family Trust I et al.                Page 12\n\n\n         But the Trust misreads Howard. In that case, the deceased’s children challenged\nthe trial court’s determination that the disputed personal property belonged to the\nfiancée. The Ohio Court of Appeals rejected the children’s argument in light of the\nfiancée’s testimony that she had not given the items to the deceased and the lack of any\nevidence to the contrary. Howard, 2004 WL 1405293, at *3.\n\n         In contrast, there is significant evidence in the present case supporting the\nconclusion that Monea never made a gift of the diamond to the Trust. Howard is\ntherefore distinguishable. In sum, the Trust has not shown by clear and convincing\nevidence that Monea ever relinquished ownership, dominion, and control over the\ndiamond. See Bolles v. Toledo Trust Co., 4 N.E. 2d 917, 920 (Ohio 1936). The district\ncourt thus did not err in finding that no gift had been made. We therefore have no need\nto address the Trust’s claim that its interest in the diamond vested prior to the\ngovernment’s forfeiture claim.\n\n                                  III. CONCLUSION\n\n         For all of the reasons set forth above, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district\ncourt.\n\fNo. 09-3730         United States v. Monea Family Trust I et al.                   Page 13\n\n\n                              ________________________\n\n                                  CONCURRENCE\n                              ________________________\n\n        HELENE N. WHITE, Circuit Judge (concurring). I write separately to make\nclear that my concurrence is based on the deference owed to the district court as finder\nof fact, and on the unique facts of the case. I do not regard Monea’s retention of\nconsiderable control over the diamond and the trustee as invalidating an intended gift to\nthe trust, if such a gift was in fact intended.\n\n        The trust at issue here was a family trust, created by Monea’s ex-wife for Monea\nand their children. The ex-wife did not fund the trust, except in an insignificant amount.\nApparently, the parties contemplated that Monea would do so if he chose. In such\nsituations, it is common for the co-beneficiary/parent/donor to give assets to the trust and\nsimultaneously exercise a significant degree of control over the assets. It is also\ncommon for settlors of trusts, or beneficiaries granted the power, to name trustees over\nwhom they have considerable control. Although this degree of control may possibly\nhave tax consequences, it does not negate the fact that the assets are owned by the trust.\n\n        Under the circumstances here, I do not think it was necessary for Monea to do\nmore than declare the diamond to be a trust asset and so inform the trustee. It has been\nsaid that bad facts make bad law, and I am concerned that we not do so here. Had\nMonea not been involved in money laundering, but had remarried and left the residuary\nof his estate to his second wife, I doubt that we would hold that his retained control of\nthe management of the diamond rendered it an asset of his estate, belonging to his\nsecond wife, rather than an asset of the trust, belonging to his children.\n\n        Notwithstanding these observations, however, I concur in the affirmance because\nI believe that there were circumstances from which the district court could have\nconcluded that Monea’s retained control and other conduct reflected that he intended that\nthe diamond be an asset of the trust in name only, and did not intend to transfer true\nownership to the trust. Although the district court’s analysis proceeded along a different\npath, I understand this to be the import of the district court’s observation that “While\n\fNo. 09-3730        United States v. Monea Family Trust I et al.                  Page 14\n\n\nMonea consistently shopped the diamond to buyers and investors, there is no evidence\nthat he did so with authority from the Trustee. Rather, the evidence indicates that Monea\nalways treated the diamond as his own, despite his representations that it was an asset\nof the estate.” On this basis, I concur.\n\f",

WHITE, J. (pp. 279-80), delivered a separate concurring opinion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>OPINION</h2>\n<p>RONALD LEE GILMAN, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>Paul Monea and a coconspirator were convicted of participating in a money-laundering scheme to hide the proceeds of drug trafficking. The district court subsequently granted a preliminary order of forfeiture regarding several items of personal property used in the scheme, including a large diamond that purportedly belonged to Monea. Several parties filed petitions to amend the order of forfeiture on the basis of their alleged ownership interest in the diamond, including the Monea Family Trust I1999 (the Trust), of which Monea and two of his children were beneficiaries. Holding that the government's interest in the diamond was superior to that of all of the claimants, the district court denied the various petitions.</p>\n<p>The Trust now appeals the district court's order. For the following reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Factual background</h2>\n<p>The Trust was established in 1999 by Deborah Douglas, who named as beneficiaries her children, Blake and Brook Monea, and her then-husband, Paul Monea (hereinafter referred to as Monea). John Tuggle, a business acquaintance of Monea, was appointed as trustee. Under the terms of the Trust Agreement, the trustee could be removed by Monea or by a majority vote of all of the beneficiaries. Monea also had the singular authority to appoint new trustees. The Trust was initially funded with $1,000, but later acquired ownership of a home near Warren, Ohio that was previously owned by former boxer Mike Tyson.</p>\n<p>In 2005, Monea completed a term of imprisonment that he had been serving for an unrelated tax-evasion conviction. Upon his release, Monea discovered that Tuggle had misappropriated well in excess of $100,000 of Trust funds. This caused Monea to remove Tuggle as the trustee in November 2005.</p>\n<p>Tuggle's replacement died unexpectedly soon after being appointed. Monea then asked Michael Miller, an acquaintance of Monea's who owned a car dealership, to serve as the trustee. During the subsequent months, Miller introduced Monea to John Rizzo, a sales broker for whom Miller was laundering drug money. Unbeknownst to either Miller or Monea, Rizzo was actually an undercover agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).</p>\n<p>Monea and Rizzo first met on March 30, 2006 to discuss the possibility of Rizzo supplying cash for some of Monea's business ventures. The two men met again on May 19, 2006 in Los Angeles, California. During this meeting, which Rizzo recorded, Monea mentioned \"a diamond that I own,\" although he did not seek Rizzo's assistance in selling it at the time. The diamond to which Monea referred is a 43.51 Carat Modified Rectangular Brilliant Yellow Diamond Internally Flawless with Fancy Intense Grate known as the \"Golden Eye.\" There is no clear evidence of how Monea first came to possess the diamond, but he told others involved in this case that he owned a diamond mine in Africa and that he received the diamond from a friend.</p>\n<p>Prior to being imprisoned for tax evasion, Monea had borrowed $500,000 from a man named Michael Dillard, who owned a pawn shop in Oklahoma. Monea used the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*274</span> money to pay taxes that he had owed. He left the diamond in Dillard's possession as collateral for the loan. Around the time that Monea first met Rizzo, he borrowed another $500,000 from an acquaintance named Gerald Deleo to pay off the Dillard loan and reacquire the diamond. Deleo also gave Monea an additional $30,000 shortly thereafter to have the diamond readied for sale by gemologists in New York. Monea led Deleo to believe that the latter would receive an ownership interest in the diamond in exchange for the monies advanced. Deleo had the diamond in his possession for two to three weeks sometime after it was readied for sale, during which time Deleo unsuccessfully searched for a potential buyer.</p>\n<p>In June 2006, Miller, in his capacity as trustee, appointed an acquaintance named David Ramsey as an agent of the Trust for the limited purpose of retrieving the diamond from a jeweler in Oklahoma who was holding the diamond on behalf of Dillard. This arrangement was made, according to Miller, so that the \"paper trail\" showed \"that the trust bought the stone for $500,000.\" Monea and Rizzo spoke shortly after Ramsey retrieved the diamond, but Monea again did not ask Rizzo for help in finding a buyer for the gemstone.</p>\n<p>In August and September 2006, Monea and Ramsey engaged in discussions with representatives from the Charity Fellowship of Truth Church, located in Avon, New York, regarding the purchase of a lake house in Massillon, Ohio. Monea had rented the house in the past and had used it to host business associates while negotiating contracts and discussing his various entrepreneurial ventures. But by August 2006, the home was in danger of going into foreclosure. Pursuant to the purchase agreement, the church would buy the lake house from its current owners for approximately $2.5 million. The Trust then agreed to purchase the home from the church for $3 million within one year thereafter.</p>\n<p>To secure the Trust's obligation to ultimately buy the home, the church was to receive a 50 percent interest in the diamond, as memorialized in a separate \"Certificate of Giving\" signed on the same day as the purchase agreement. According to the purchase agreement, the diamond would be sold, with the proceeds from the sale to first be used to buy the lake house from the church for $3 million. The remaining balance from the sale of the diamond would belong to the Trust.</p>\n<p>Church representatives present during these discussions testified that Monea and Ramsey conveyed the impression that the diamond belonged to the Trust and that Ramsey was acting as the Trust's agent. They further stated that Miller was present at a Canton, Ohio country club where both the purchase agreement and the Certificate of Giving were signed in September 2006. Miller acknowledged meeting the church representatives at his home earlier on the day in question. Although Miller never testified as to whether he was present at the country club when the documents were signed, he denied participating in any negotiations between the church and Monea and maintained that he was never informed of any agreement reached by the two parties. Moreover, Miller said that he had not authorized Ramsey to act on behalf of the Trust beyond retrieving the diamond from Dillard's jeweler in Oklahoma. Ramsey, however, signed both documents on behalf of the Trust, and Monea signed the purchase agreement as an \"acting Trustee\" for the Charity Fellowship of Truth Church.</p>\n<p>Following these negotiations, Monea, Ramsey, and Reverend David Moore from the church took the diamond to Los Angeles and Las Vegas to show to potential <span class=\"star-pagination\">*275</span> buyers. During part of this time, Reverend Moore had the diamond in his possession without either Monea or Ramsey being present. Miller was never informed that these showings were taking place or that Reverend Moore at times had sole custody of the diamond.</p>\n<p>That fall, Miller and Monea continued their efforts to sell the diamond, with Miller hiring at least two different brokers in October 2006 to assist them in finding a buyer. Miller and Monea met with Rizzo again on October 17, 2006. This time their discussion, which Rizzo recorded, revolved around Rizzo finding a buyer to purchase the diamond for $15 million. During their conversation, Monea maintained that he was \"just trying to sell on behalf of the trust an asset that the trust has.\" Miller added that any money from the sale was \"going in the trust.\"</p>\n<p>In early November 2006, Monea and Rizzo reached an agreement in which Monea agreed to sell the diamond to drug dealers who Rizzo knew in exchange for $19.5 million and a boat. Discussions regarding commissions, the payment of earnest money, and the wiring of funds continued through mid-December. Monea typically handled these negotiations, with little meaningful involvement from Miller, and he met with Rizzo on one occasion in Las Vegas without Miller being present. On another occasion in November 2006, when Monea believed that he was nearing the close of a deal, he told a potential buyer that \"I think I got my diamond sold.\"</p>\n<p>Monea also gave Miller a list detailing how the proceeds of the sale were to be disbursed. A majority of the payments to be made were unrelated to either the debts or investments of the Trust, and several payments were to be used to discharge personal debts incurred by Monea.</p>\n<p>On December 13, 2006, Monea, Miller, and Rizzo met at the office of the Trust's lawyer, Jack Morrison, to complete the sale of the diamond. Morrison had prepared several documents to complete the transaction, including a bill of sale, an acknowledgment and receipt, and a tax return, all of which indicated that the Trust owned the diamond. At the close of the meeting, Miller and Monea were arrested by the FBI.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Procedural background</h2>\n<p>A grand jury charged Monea with one count of conspiracy to launder money, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1956(h), and three counts of money laundering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a). Miller was charged with one count of conspiracy to launder money and 36 counts of money laundering. The superseding indictment also sought forfeiture of several pieces of personal property and real estate used in the money-laundering scheme, including the diamond.</p>\n<p>Following a jury trial, Monea was convicted on all four counts and was sentenced to 150 months' imprisonment. The jury also found that the diamond was involved in the four counts with which Monea was charged. For his part in the scheme, Miller pled guilty pursuant to a plea agreement and was sentenced to 57 months' imprisonment.</p>\n<p>In June 2007, the district court entered a preliminary order of forfeiture that authorized the government to seize various properties used in the money-laundering scheme, including the diamond. Several parties, including the Charity Fellowship of Truth Church, Deleo, and the Trust, filed petitions seeking to establish ownership of the diamond. After the court denied the government's motion to dismiss all but one of the petitions, it held a three-day forfeiture hearing in October 2007.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*276</span> During the hearing, several witnesses testified that the diamond was a Trust asset. Miller, as well as the current trustee, Nancy McCann, both testified that the Trust owned the diamond. Blake Monea similarly testified that he had always understood that the diamond belonged to the Trust. None of these witnesses, however, were able to identify any document that established the Trust's ownership of the diamond. Furthermore, both Miller and Blake Monea testified that they arrived at their conclusions regarding the Trust's ownership based solely on representations made by Paul Monea.</p>\n<p>Other evidence introduced at the hearing indicated that the Trust did not own the diamond. Tuggle testified that the diamond never became a trust asset while he was serving as trustee. John Tanza, the undercover agent posing as Rizzo, likewise testified that when he first discussed finding a buyer for the diamond, Monea stated that the diamond was his. Also undercutting the Trust's claim of ownership was an affidavit of Paul A. Monea (one of Monea's sons) that was filed in a bankruptcy case involving the son's business. In the affidavit, Paul A. Monea stated that \"[t]o the best of my knowledge the diamond was and is owned by Paul M. Monea, my father, in his individual capacity.\"</p>\n<p>The legitimacy of the Trust was also called into doubt at the hearing. Tuggle, for example, conceded that when he was trustee, Monea had him \"step and fetch and do whatever [Monea] said.\" The Trust, Tuggle further admitted, was in reality Monea's \"private slush fund[].\" Tanza similarly testified that, based on his conversations with Monea and Miller, \"the reason for the trust was to protect the assets of Mr. Monea from any type of attack from either legal or civil actions.\"</p>\n<p>As for Miller, in describing his role as trustee, he stated that he was not involved in the negotiations with brokers to sell the diamond and would simply sign whatever broker agreements that Monea presented. Miller also testified that Monea directed him to sign a document designating Ramsey as an agent of the Trust for the purpose of picking up the diamond from Dillard's jeweler in Oklahoma. He further recalled that he \"never had the diamond in my possession, ever\"; instead, Monea usually carried the diamond in a velvet bag in his pants pocket, although Ramsey would \"sometimes\" carry it in his pocket.</p>\n<p>Following the hearing, the district court denied all of the petitions seeking ownership of the diamond. Specifically, the court found that the government's interest in the diamond vested on March 30, 2006, the date on which Monea first spoke with Rizzo, because that was when the conspiracy first began. The court further concluded that Monea never \"surrendered ownership and control of the diamond\" to the Trust and that he \"always treated the diamond as his own, despite his representations that it was an asset of the estate.\" Moreover, the court questioned the validity of the Trust. Although the court declined to make a formal ruling, it noted that \"there is strong evidence that the Trust itself was a sham.\" Finally, the court held that none of the other claimants had established an interest in the diamond superior to that of the government's. This timely appeal of the district court's order, brought by the Trust only, followed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. ANALYSIS</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Standard of review</h2>\n<p>We review de novo a district court's interpretation of federal forfeiture law. <i>United States v. Jones,</i> 502 F.3d 388, 391 (6th Cir.2007). Although findings of fact are reviewed under the clear-error <span class=\"star-pagination\">*277</span> standard, \"[t]he issue of whether those facts are sufficient to constitute a proper criminal forfeiture is reviewed de novo.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. The Trust's interest in the diamond</h2>\n<p>Pursuant to 21 U.S.C. § 853(n)(6), a district court can amend an order of forfeiture in only two circumstances. The first of these circumstances is where \"the petitioner has a legal right, title, or interest in the property\" that \"was vested in the petitioner... or was superior to any right, title, or interest of the defendant at the time of the commission of the acts which gave rise to the forfeiture of the property.\" <i>Id.</i> § 853(n)(6)(A). Amending an order of forfeiture is also appropriate where \"the petitioner is a bona fide purchaser for value of the right, title, or interest in the property and was at the time of purchase reasonably without cause to believe that the property was subject to forfeiture under such section.\" <i>Id.</i> § 853(n)(6)(B).</p>\n<p>To succeed on a petition to amend a forfeiture order, a claimant must establish ownership by a preponderance of evidence. <i>Id.</i> § 853(n)(6). The Trust does not argue that it was a bona fide purchaser of the diamond, so we need address only whether the Trust had a vested interest in the diamond when the acts giving rise to the money-laundering conspiracy occurred. Both parties agree that Ohio law governs. We must therefore determine (1) whether the Trust had a legal right, title, or interest in the diamond, and (2) if so, whether that right, title, or interest vested prior to the government obtaining its interest.</p>\n<p>Turning to the first issue, we note that there is no dispute that the first person to possess the diamond among all of the interested parties was Monea. There is also no evidence of any document granting the Trust an ownership interest in the diamond. In light of these facts, the district court limited its analysis to whether Monea had gifted the diamond to the Trust, thereby implying that this was the only remaining method that could have resulted in the transfer of ownership from Monea to the Trust. Neither side has indicated that any other method of transfer occurred.</p>\n<p>Two conditions must be met under Ohio law for a gift to be made. First, there must be \"an intention on the part of the donor to transfer the title and right of possession of the particular property to the donee.\" <i>Bolles v. Toledo Trust Co.,</i> 132 Ohio St. 21, 4 N.E.2d 917, 920 (1936). Second, there must be \"a delivery by the donor to the donee of the subject-matter of the gift to the extent practicable or possible considering its nature, with relinquishment of ownership, dominion, and control over it.\" <i>Id.</i> Each of these conditions must be supported by clear and convincing evidence. <i>Id.</i> Because this standard is higher than that for establishing an ownership interest under 21 U.S.C. § 853(n)(6), a finding that Monea gifted the diamond to the Trust would necessarily result in a finding that the Trust has an ownership interest in the diamond.</p>\n<p>Regarding the question of donative intent, the district court concluded that, \"[a]t best, ... Monea's repeated assertions that the diamond was an asset of the Trust\" evidenced his intent to make a gift to the Trust. Neither party has challenged the court's ruling in this regard.</p>\n<p>We therefore turn our attention to the second elementwhether Monea delivered the diamond to the Trust by relinquishing ownership, dominion, and control over it. The Trust contends that such delivery took place when Ramsey picked up the diamond from the jeweler in Oklahoma because Ramsey was acting as an agent of the Trust at that time. Once Ramsey retrieved <span class=\"star-pagination\">*278</span> the diamond, however, he never gave it to the Trust. Rather, Monea permitted Deleo to have the diamond for two to three weeks while shopping it to potential buyers. There is no evidence that the Trust approved or was ever aware of this arrangement.</p>\n<p>Upon repossessing the diamond, Monea typically carried it in his pants pocket, with Ramsey \"sometimes\" doing the same. On the other hand, Miller, then serving as the trustee, never had the diamond in his possession and had no input \"on where the diamond would go and where it would be.\" The fact that Monea and Ramsey never surrendered possession of the diamond to the trustee weighs strongly against a finding of delivery to the Trust. <i>See </i><i>LCP Holding Co. v. Taylor,</i> 158 Ohio App.3d 546, 817 N.E.2d 439, 445 (2004) (holding that \"delivery occurred when appellee surrendered possession of the stock and endorsed the stock to his children as owners\").</p>\n<p>In addition to not surrendering possession of the diamond, Monea continued to keep it for his personal use. He promised Deleo an interest in the diamond in exchange for money to pay off Monea's debt to Dillard and to have the diamond readied for sale. Soon thereafter, Monea and Ramsey entered into a Certificate of Giving with Charity Fellowship of Truth Church that granted the church a 50 percent security interest in the diamond. Although Ramsey stated in the Certificate that he was acting on behalf of the Trust, Miller denied any knowledge of the church obtaining an interest in the diamond or that Monea and Ramsey were even participating in such negotiations. Miller was also never informed that Monea, Ramsey, and Reverend Moore were showing the diamond to potential buyers in Los Angeles and Las Vegas or that Reverend Moore at times had sole custody of the diamond.</p>\n<p>The Trust defends these actions by claiming that both Monea and Ramsey were acting as agents of the Trust, but we find this argument unpersuasive. There is no evidence in the record that the Trust ever appointed Monea to be an agent or entrusted him with the diamond in any other capacity. In fact, the only evidence that Monea was negotiating on behalf of any party is when he signed the purchase agreement as a trustee <i>of the church.</i> And although documentation exists appointing Ramsey as an agent of the Trust, it specifically limited his authority to \"the purpose of delivering $500,000 (Five Hundred Thousand Dollars) payment to Mike Dillard and the receipt of any material at the time of payment.\" Monea and Ramsey then proceeded to engage in negotiations to sell the diamond not only without the Trust's knowledge, but also well beyond any scope of agency that either potentially had with the Trust.</p>\n<p>The evidence also shows that the primary beneficiary of these negotiations was to be Monea himself rather than the Trust. Monea sought ownership of the Massillon lake house so that he could continue to entertain business clients at the residence, and the majority of the proceeds from the planned December 2006 sale of the diamond was earmarked for Monea's personal debts and investments. He even referred to the gemstone as \"my diamond\" on at least one occasion during conversations with potential buyers. And because Monea continued to use the diamond for his own purposes and did not surrender possession of it, delivery of the diamond to the Trust never occurred.</p>\n<p>The Trust nevertheless contends that testimony from the forfeiture hearing regarding its ownership of the diamond was unrebutted and therefore conclusively establishes that the diamond was a Trust asset. To support this assertion, the Trust <span class=\"star-pagination\">*279</span> relies upon <i>Howard v. Himmelrick,</i> No. 03AP-1034, 2004 WL 1405293 (Ohio Ct. App. June 24, 2004). In <i>Howard,</i> the fiancée of a recently deceased man sued to recover possession of several pieces of personal property located in the man's home when he died, but which she claimed were hers. Following a hearing, the trial court determined that the property belonged to the fiancée. The man's children, who had refused to surrender possession of the items, argued on appeal that this ruling was against the manifest weight of the evidence. Although the only evidence that the fiancée had retained ownership of the property was her own testimony, there was no other evidence refuting her statements. The Ohio Court of Appeals held that such unrebutted testimony was \"competent and credible evidence\" of ownership and, accordingly, that the trial court's ruling was not against the manifest weight of the evidence. <i>Id.</i> at *3.</p>\n<p>But the Trust misreads <i>Howard.</i> In that case, the deceased's children challenged the trial court's determination that the disputed personal property belonged to the fiancée. The Ohio Court of Appeals rejected the children's argument in light of the fiancée's testimony that she had not given the items to the deceased and the lack of any evidence to the contrary. <i>Howard,</i> 2004 WL 1405293, at *3.</p>\n<p>In contrast, there is significant evidence in the present case supporting the conclusion that Monea never made a gift of the diamond to the Trust. <i>Howard</i> is therefore distinguishable. In sum, the Trust has not shown by clear and convincing evidence that Monea ever relinquished ownership, dominion, and control over the diamond. <i>See </i><i>Bolles v. Toledo Trust Co.,</i> 132 Ohio St. 21, 4 N.E.2d 917, 920 (1936). The district court thus did not err in finding that no gift had been made. We therefore have no need to address the Trust's claim that its interest in the diamond vested prior to the government's forfeiture claim.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>For all of the reasons set forth above, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p>HELENE N. WHITE, Circuit Judge (concurring).</p>\n<p>I write separately to make clear that my concurrence is based on the deference owed to the district court as finder of fact, and on the unique facts of the case. I do not regard Monea's retention of considerable control over the diamond and the trustee as invalidating an intended gift to the trust, if such a gift was in fact intended.</p>\n<p>The trust at issue here was a family trust, created by Monea's ex-wife for Monea and their children.

It has been said that bad facts make bad law, and I am concerned that we not do so here. Had Monea not been involved in money laundering, but had remarried and left the residuary of his estate to his second wife, I doubt that we would hold that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*280</span> his retained control of the management of the diamond rendered it an asset of his estate, belonging to his second wife, rather than an asset of the trust, belonging to his children.</p>\n<p>Notwithstanding these observations, however, I concur in the affirmance because I believe that there were circumstances from which the district court could have concluded that Monea's retained control and other conduct reflected that he intended that the diamond be an asset of the trust in name only, and did not intend to transfer true ownership to the trust.

WHITE, J. (pp. 279-80), delivered a separate concurring opinion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>OPINION</h2>\n<p>RONALD LEE GILMAN, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>Paul Monea and a coconspirator were convicted of participating in a money-laundering scheme to hide the proceeds of drug trafficking. The district court subsequently granted a preliminary order of forfeiture regarding several items of personal property used in the scheme, including a large diamond that purportedly belonged to Monea. Several parties filed petitions to amend the order of forfeiture on the basis of their alleged ownership interest in the diamond, including the Monea Family Trust I1999 (the Trust), of which Monea and two of his children were beneficiaries. Holding that the government's interest in the diamond was superior to that of all of the claimants, the district court denied the various petitions.</p>\n<p>The Trust now appeals the district court's order. For the following reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Factual background</h2>\n<p>The Trust was established in 1999 by Deborah Douglas, who named as beneficiaries her children, Blake and Brook Monea, and her then-husband, Paul Monea (hereinafter referred to as Monea). John Tuggle, a business acquaintance of Monea, was appointed as trustee. Under the terms of the Trust Agreement, the trustee could be removed by Monea or by a majority vote of all of the beneficiaries. Monea also had the singular authority to appoint new trustees. The Trust was initially funded with $1,000, but later acquired ownership of a home near Warren, Ohio that was previously owned by former boxer Mike Tyson.</p>\n<p>In 2005, Monea completed a term of imprisonment that he had been serving for an unrelated tax-evasion conviction. Upon his release, Monea discovered that Tuggle had misappropriated well in excess of $100,000 of Trust funds. This caused Monea to remove Tuggle as the trustee in November 2005.</p>\n<p>Tuggle's replacement died unexpectedly soon after being appointed. Monea then asked Michael Miller, an acquaintance of Monea's who owned a car dealership, to serve as the trustee. During the subsequent months, Miller introduced Monea to John Rizzo, a sales broker for whom Miller was laundering drug money. Unbeknownst to either Miller or Monea, Rizzo was actually an undercover agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).</p>\n<p>Monea and Rizzo first met on March 30, 2006 to discuss the possibility of Rizzo supplying cash for some of Monea's business ventures. The two men met again on May 19, 2006 in Los Angeles, California. During this meeting, which Rizzo recorded, Monea mentioned \"a diamond that I own,\" although he did not seek Rizzo's assistance in selling it at the time. The diamond to which Monea referred is a 43.51 Carat Modified Rectangular Brilliant Yellow Diamond Internally Flawless with Fancy Intense Grate known as the \"Golden Eye.\" There is no clear evidence of how Monea first came to possess the diamond, but he told others involved in this case that he owned a diamond mine in Africa and that he received the diamond from a friend.</p>\n<p>Prior to being imprisoned for tax evasion, Monea had borrowed $500,000 from a man named Michael Dillard, who owned a pawn shop in Oklahoma. Monea used the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*274</span> money to pay taxes that he had owed. He left the diamond in Dillard's possession as collateral for the loan. Around the time that Monea first met Rizzo, he borrowed another $500,000 from an acquaintance named Gerald Deleo to pay off the Dillard loan and reacquire the diamond. Deleo also gave Monea an additional $30,000 shortly thereafter to have the diamond readied for sale by gemologists in New York. Monea led Deleo to believe that the latter would receive an ownership interest in the diamond in exchange for the monies advanced. Deleo had the diamond in his possession for two to three weeks sometime after it was readied for sale, during which time Deleo unsuccessfully searched for a potential buyer.</p>\n<p>In June 2006, Miller, in his capacity as trustee, appointed an acquaintance named David Ramsey as an agent of the Trust for the limited purpose of retrieving the diamond from a jeweler in Oklahoma who was holding the diamond on behalf of Dillard. This arrangement was made, according to Miller, so that the \"paper trail\" showed \"that the trust bought the stone for $500,000.\" Monea and Rizzo spoke shortly after Ramsey retrieved the diamond, but Monea again did not ask Rizzo for help in finding a buyer for the gemstone.</p>\n<p>In August and September 2006, Monea and Ramsey engaged in discussions with representatives from the Charity Fellowship of Truth Church, located in Avon, New York, regarding the purchase of a lake house in Massillon, Ohio. Monea had rented the house in the past and had used it to host business associates while negotiating contracts and discussing his various entrepreneurial ventures. But by August 2006, the home was in danger of going into foreclosure. Pursuant to the purchase agreement, the church would buy the lake house from its current owners for approximately $2.5 million. The Trust then agreed to purchase the home from the church for $3 million within one year thereafter.</p>\n<p>To secure the Trust's obligation to ultimately buy the home, the church was to receive a 50 percent interest in the diamond, as memorialized in a separate \"Certificate of Giving\" signed on the same day as the purchase agreement. According to the purchase agreement, the diamond would be sold, with the proceeds from the sale to first be used to buy the lake house from the church for $3 million. The remaining balance from the sale of the diamond would belong to the Trust.</p>\n<p>Church representatives present during these discussions testified that Monea and Ramsey conveyed the impression that the diamond belonged to the Trust and that Ramsey was acting as the Trust's agent. They further stated that Miller was present at a Canton, Ohio country club where both the purchase agreement and the Certificate of Giving were signed in September 2006. Miller acknowledged meeting the church representatives at his home earlier on the day in question. Although Miller never testified as to whether he was present at the country club when the documents were signed, he denied participating in any negotiations between the church and Monea and maintained that he was never informed of any agreement reached by the two parties. Moreover, Miller said that he had not authorized Ramsey to act on behalf of the Trust beyond retrieving the diamond from Dillard's jeweler in Oklahoma. Ramsey, however, signed both documents on behalf of the Trust, and Monea signed the purchase agreement as an \"acting Trustee\" for the Charity Fellowship of Truth Church.</p>\n<p>Following these negotiations, Monea, Ramsey, and Reverend David Moore from the church took the diamond to Los Angeles and Las Vegas to show to potential <span class=\"star-pagination\">*275</span> buyers. During part of this time, Reverend Moore had the diamond in his possession without either Monea or Ramsey being present. Miller was never informed that these showings were taking place or that Reverend Moore at times had sole custody of the diamond.</p>\n<p>That fall, Miller and Monea continued their efforts to sell the diamond, with Miller hiring at least two different brokers in October 2006 to assist them in finding a buyer. Miller and Monea met with Rizzo again on October 17, 2006. This time their discussion, which Rizzo recorded, revolved around Rizzo finding a buyer to purchase the diamond for $15 million. During their conversation, Monea maintained that he was \"just trying to sell on behalf of the trust an asset that the trust has.\" Miller added that any money from the sale was \"going in the trust.\"</p>\n<p>In early November 2006, Monea and Rizzo reached an agreement in which Monea agreed to sell the diamond to drug dealers who Rizzo knew in exchange for $19.5 million and a boat. Discussions regarding commissions, the payment of earnest money, and the wiring of funds continued through mid-December. Monea typically handled these negotiations, with little meaningful involvement from Miller, and he met with Rizzo on one occasion in Las Vegas without Miller being present. On another occasion in November 2006, when Monea believed that he was nearing the close of a deal, he told a potential buyer that \"I think I got my diamond sold.\"</p>\n<p>Monea also gave Miller a list detailing how the proceeds of the sale were to be disbursed. A majority of the payments to be made were unrelated to either the debts or investments of the Trust, and several payments were to be used to discharge personal debts incurred by Monea.</p>\n<p>On December 13, 2006, Monea, Miller, and Rizzo met at the office of the Trust's lawyer, Jack Morrison, to complete the sale of the diamond. Morrison had prepared several documents to complete the transaction, including a bill of sale, an acknowledgment and receipt, and a tax return, all of which indicated that the Trust owned the diamond. At the close of the meeting, Miller and Monea were arrested by the FBI.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Procedural background</h2>\n<p>A grand jury charged Monea with one count of conspiracy to launder money, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1956(h), and three counts of money laundering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a). Miller was charged with one count of conspiracy to launder money and 36 counts of money laundering. The superseding indictment also sought forfeiture of several pieces of personal property and real estate used in the money-laundering scheme, including the diamond.</p>\n<p>Following a jury trial, Monea was convicted on all four counts and was sentenced to 150 months' imprisonment. The jury also found that the diamond was involved in the four counts with which Monea was charged. For his part in the scheme, Miller pled guilty pursuant to a plea agreement and was sentenced to 57 months' imprisonment.</p>\n<p>In June 2007, the district court entered a preliminary order of forfeiture that authorized the government to seize various properties used in the money-laundering scheme, including the diamond. Several parties, including the Charity Fellowship of Truth Church, Deleo, and the Trust, filed petitions seeking to establish ownership of the diamond. After the court denied the government's motion to dismiss all but one of the petitions, it held a three-day forfeiture hearing in October 2007.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*276</span> During the hearing, several witnesses testified that the diamond was a Trust asset. Miller, as well as the current trustee, Nancy McCann, both testified that the Trust owned the diamond. Blake Monea similarly testified that he had always understood that the diamond belonged to the Trust. None of these witnesses, however, were able to identify any document that established the Trust's ownership of the diamond. Furthermore, both Miller and Blake Monea testified that they arrived at their conclusions regarding the Trust's ownership based solely on representations made by Paul Monea.</p>\n<p>Other evidence introduced at the hearing indicated that the Trust did not own the diamond. Tuggle testified that the diamond never became a trust asset while he was serving as trustee. John Tanza, the undercover agent posing as Rizzo, likewise testified that when he first discussed finding a buyer for the diamond, Monea stated that the diamond was his. Also undercutting the Trust's claim of ownership was an affidavit of Paul A. Monea (one of Monea's sons) that was filed in a bankruptcy case involving the son's business. In the affidavit, Paul A. Monea stated that \"[t]o the best of my knowledge the diamond was and is owned by Paul M. Monea, my father, in his individual capacity.\"</p>\n<p>The legitimacy of the Trust was also called into doubt at the hearing. Tuggle, for example, conceded that when he was trustee, Monea had him \"step and fetch and do whatever [Monea] said.\" The Trust, Tuggle further admitted, was in reality Monea's \"private slush fund[].\" Tanza similarly testified that, based on his conversations with Monea and Miller, \"the reason for the trust was to protect the assets of Mr. Monea from any type of attack from either legal or civil actions.\"</p>\n<p>As for Miller, in describing his role as trustee, he stated that he was not involved in the negotiations with brokers to sell the diamond and would simply sign whatever broker agreements that Monea presented. Miller also testified that Monea directed him to sign a document designating Ramsey as an agent of the Trust for the purpose of picking up the diamond from Dillard's jeweler in Oklahoma. He further recalled that he \"never had the diamond in my possession, ever\"; instead, Monea usually carried the diamond in a velvet bag in his pants pocket, although Ramsey would \"sometimes\" carry it in his pocket.</p>\n<p>Following the hearing, the district court denied all of the petitions seeking ownership of the diamond. Specifically, the court found that the government's interest in the diamond vested on March 30, 2006, the date on which Monea first spoke with Rizzo, because that was when the conspiracy first began. The court further concluded that Monea never \"surrendered ownership and control of the diamond\" to the Trust and that he \"always treated the diamond as his own, despite his representations that it was an asset of the estate.\" Moreover, the court questioned the validity of the Trust. Although the court declined to make a formal ruling, it noted that \"there is strong evidence that the Trust itself was a sham.\" Finally, the court held that none of the other claimants had established an interest in the diamond superior to that of the government's. This timely appeal of the district court's order, brought by the Trust only, followed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. ANALYSIS</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Standard of review</h2>\n<p>We review de novo a district court's interpretation of federal forfeiture law. <i>United States v. Jones,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1236829\"><a href=\"/opinion/1236829/united-states-v-jones/\"><span class=\"volume\">502</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">388</span></a></span>, 391 (6th Cir.2007). Although findings of fact are reviewed under the clear-error <span class=\"star-pagination\">*277</span> standard, \"[t]he issue of whether those facts are sufficient to constitute a proper criminal forfeiture is reviewed de novo.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. The Trust's interest in the diamond</h2>\n<p>Pursuant to 21 U.S.C. § 853(n)(6), a district court can amend an order of forfeiture in only two circumstances. The first of these circumstances is where \"the petitioner has a legal right, title, or interest in the property\" that \"was vested in the petitioner... or was superior to any right, title, or interest of the defendant at the time of the commission of the acts which gave rise to the forfeiture of the property.\" <i>Id.</i> § 853(n)(6)(A). Amending an order of forfeiture is also appropriate where \"the petitioner is a bona fide purchaser for value of the right, title, or interest in the property and was at the time of purchase reasonably without cause to believe that the property was subject to forfeiture under such section.\" <i>Id.</i> § 853(n)(6)(B).</p>\n<p>To succeed on a petition to amend a forfeiture order, a claimant must establish ownership by a preponderance of evidence. <i>Id.</i> § 853(n)(6). The Trust does not argue that it was a bona fide purchaser of the diamond, so we need address only whether the Trust had a vested interest in the diamond when the acts giving rise to the money-laundering conspiracy occurred. Both parties agree that Ohio law governs. We must therefore determine (1) whether the Trust had a legal right, title, or interest in the diamond, and (2) if so, whether that right, title, or interest vested prior to the government obtaining its interest.</p>\n<p>Turning to the first issue, we note that there is no dispute that the first person to possess the diamond among all of the interested parties was Monea. There is also no evidence of any document granting the Trust an ownership interest in the diamond. In light of these facts, the district court limited its analysis to whether Monea had gifted the diamond to the Trust, thereby implying that this was the only remaining method that could have resulted in the transfer of ownership from Monea to the Trust. Neither side has indicated that any other method of transfer occurred.</p>\n<p>Two conditions must be met under Ohio law for a gift to be made. First, there must be \"an intention on the part of the donor to transfer the title and right of possession of the particular property to the donee.\" <i>Bolles v. Toledo Trust Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">132</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St.</span> <span class=\"page\">21</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">917</span></span>, 920 (1936). Second, there must be \"a delivery by the donor to the donee of the subject-matter of the gift to the extent practicable or possible considering its nature, with relinquishment of ownership, dominion, and control over it.\" <i>Id.</i> Each of these conditions must be supported by clear and convincing evidence. <i>Id.</i> Because this standard is higher than that for establishing an ownership interest under 21 U.S.C. § 853(n)(6), a finding that Monea gifted the diamond to the Trust would necessarily result in a finding that the Trust has an ownership interest in the diamond.</p>\n<p>Regarding the question of donative intent, the district court concluded that, \"[a]t best, ... Monea's repeated assertions that the diamond was an asset of the Trust\" evidenced his intent to make a gift to the Trust. Neither party has challenged the court's ruling in this regard.</p>\n<p>We therefore turn our attention to the second elementwhether Monea delivered the diamond to the Trust by relinquishing ownership, dominion, and control over it. The Trust contends that such delivery took place when Ramsey picked up the diamond from the jeweler in Oklahoma because Ramsey was acting as an agent of the Trust at that time. Once Ramsey retrieved <span class=\"star-pagination\">*278</span> the diamond, however, he never gave it to the Trust. Rather, Monea permitted Deleo to have the diamond for two to three weeks while shopping it to potential buyers. There is no evidence that the Trust approved or was ever aware of this arrangement.</p>\n<p>Upon repossessing the diamond, Monea typically carried it in his pants pocket, with Ramsey \"sometimes\" doing the same. On the other hand, Miller, then serving as the trustee, never had the diamond in his possession and had no input \"on where the diamond would go and where it would be.\" The fact that Monea and Ramsey never surrendered possession of the diamond to the trustee weighs strongly against a finding of delivery to the Trust. <i>See </i><i>LCP Holding Co. v. Taylor,</i> 158 Ohio App.3d 546, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">817</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">439</span></span>, 445 (2004) (holding that \"delivery occurred when appellee surrendered possession of the stock and endorsed the stock to his children as owners\").</p>\n<p>In addition to not surrendering possession of the diamond, Monea continued to keep it for his personal use. He promised Deleo an interest in the diamond in exchange for money to pay off Monea's debt to Dillard and to have the diamond readied for sale. Soon thereafter, Monea and Ramsey entered into a Certificate of Giving with Charity Fellowship of Truth Church that granted the church a 50 percent security interest in the diamond. Although Ramsey stated in the Certificate that he was acting on behalf of the Trust, Miller denied any knowledge of the church obtaining an interest in the diamond or that Monea and Ramsey were even participating in such negotiations. Miller was also never informed that Monea, Ramsey, and Reverend Moore were showing the diamond to potential buyers in Los Angeles and Las Vegas or that Reverend Moore at times had sole custody of the diamond.</p>\n<p>The Trust defends these actions by claiming that both Monea and Ramsey were acting as agents of the Trust, but we find this argument unpersuasive. There is no evidence in the record that the Trust ever appointed Monea to be an agent or entrusted him with the diamond in any other capacity. In fact, the only evidence that Monea was negotiating on behalf of any party is when he signed the purchase agreement as a trustee <i>of the church.</i> And although documentation exists appointing Ramsey as an agent of the Trust, it specifically limited his authority to \"the purpose of delivering $500,000 (Five Hundred Thousand Dollars) payment to Mike Dillard and the receipt of any material at the time of payment.\" Monea and Ramsey then proceeded to engage in negotiations to sell the diamond not only without the Trust's knowledge, but also well beyond any scope of agency that either potentially had with the Trust.</p>\n<p>The evidence also shows that the primary beneficiary of these negotiations was to be Monea himself rather than the Trust. Monea sought ownership of the Massillon lake house so that he could continue to entertain business clients at the residence, and the majority of the proceeds from the planned December 2006 sale of the diamond was earmarked for Monea's personal debts and investments. He even referred to the gemstone as \"my diamond\" on at least one occasion during conversations with potential buyers. And because Monea continued to use the diamond for his own purposes and did not surrender possession of it, delivery of the diamond to the Trust never occurred.</p>\n<p>The Trust nevertheless contends that testimony from the forfeiture hearing regarding its ownership of the diamond was unrebutted and therefore conclusively establishes that the diamond was a Trust asset. To support this assertion, the Trust <span class=\"star-pagination\">*279</span> relies upon <i>Howard v. Himmelrick,</i> No. 03AP-1034, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2004</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1405293</span></span> (Ohio Ct. App. June 24, 2004). In <i>Howard,</i> the fiancée of a recently deceased man sued to recover possession of several pieces of personal property located in the man's home when he died, but which she claimed were hers. Following a hearing, the trial court determined that the property belonged to the fiancée. The man's children, who had refused to surrender possession of the items, argued on appeal that this ruling was against the manifest weight of the evidence. Although the only evidence that the fiancée had retained ownership of the property was her own testimony, there was no other evidence refuting her statements. The Ohio Court of Appeals held that such unrebutted testimony was \"competent and credible evidence\" of ownership and, accordingly, that the trial court's ruling was not against the manifest weight of the evidence. <i>Id.</i> at *3.</p>\n<p>But the Trust misreads <i>Howard.</i> In that case, the deceased's children challenged the trial court's determination that the disputed personal property belonged to the fiancée. The Ohio Court of Appeals rejected the children's argument in light of the fiancée's testimony that she had not given the items to the deceased and the lack of any evidence to the contrary. <i>Howard,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2004</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1405293</span></span>, at *3.</p>\n<p>In contrast, there is significant evidence in the present case supporting the conclusion that Monea never made a gift of the diamond to the Trust. <i>Howard</i> is therefore distinguishable. In sum, the Trust has not shown by clear and convincing evidence that Monea ever relinquished ownership, dominion, and control over the diamond. <i>See </i><i>Bolles v. Toledo Trust Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">132</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St.</span> <span class=\"page\">21</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">917</span></span>, 920 (1936). The district court thus did not err in finding that no gift had been made. We therefore have no need to address the Trust's claim that its interest in the diamond vested prior to the government's forfeiture claim.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>For all of the reasons set forth above, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p>HELENE N. WHITE, Circuit Judge (concurring).</p>\n<p>I write separately to make clear that my concurrence is based on the deference owed to the district court as finder of fact, and on the unique facts of the case. I do not regard Monea's retention of considerable control over the diamond and the trustee as invalidating an intended gift to the trust, if such a gift was in fact intended.</p>\n<p>The trust at issue here was a family trust, created by Monea's ex-wife for Monea and their children. The ex-wife did not fund the trust, except in an insignificant amount. Apparently, the parties contemplated that Monea would do so if he chose. In such situations, it is common for the co-beneficiary/parent/donor to give assets to the trust and simultaneously exercise a significant degree of control over the assets. It is also common for settlors of trusts, or beneficiaries granted the power, to name trustees over whom they have considerable control. Although this degree of control may possibly have tax consequences, it does not negate the fact that the assets are owned by the trust.</p>\n<p>Under the circumstances here, I do not think it was necessary for Monea to do more than declare the diamond to be a trust asset and so inform the trustee. It has been said that bad facts make bad law, and I am concerned that we not do so here. Had Monea not been involved in money laundering, but had remarried and left the residuary of his estate to his second wife, I doubt that we would hold that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*280</span> his retained control of the management of the diamond rendered it an asset of his estate, belonging to his second wife, rather than an asset of the trust, belonging to his children.</p>\n<p>Notwithstanding these observations, however, I concur in the affirmance because I believe that there were circumstances from which the district court could have concluded that Monea's retained control and other conduct reflected that he intended that the diamond be an asset of the trust in name only, and did not intend to transfer true ownership to the trust. Although the district court's analysis proceeded along a different path, I understand this to be the import of the district court's observation that \"While Monea consistently shopped the diamond to buyers and investors, there is no evidence that he did so with authority from the Trustee. Rather, the evidence indicates that Monea always treated the diamond as his own, despite his representations that it was an asset of the estate.\" On this basis, I concur.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  The Honorable Michael H.
