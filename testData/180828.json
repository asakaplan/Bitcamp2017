On September 10, 2008, Antonius Coleman (“Coleman”)\npled guilty to two counts of being a felon in possession of ammunition. As a condition\nfor the plea, the United States agreed, subject to certain conditions, to recommend full\nacceptance of responsibility and to dismiss a possession-of-marijuana count. At\nsentencing, Coleman was given a four-level enhancement for possessing 23 live rounds\nof ammunition that facilitated or had the potential to facilitate a felony distribution of\nmarijuana. Coleman was given a two-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility,\nbut the United States declined to make a motion for the third-level of reduction for\nacceptance of responsibility.\n\n       Coleman appealed the four-level enhancement for possessing the 23 rounds of\nlive ammunition and the United States’ refusal to make a motion for a third-level of\nreduction for acceptance of responsibility to this Court. For the following reasons, we\nAFFIRM Coleman’s sentence.\n\nI.     BACKGROUND\n\n       The facts underlying the relevant criminal conduct in this case are not in dispute\nand are reflected in the Presentence Report (the “PSR”). On January 4, 2008, at\napproximately 9:50 p.m., Memphis Police Department Officers (the “Officers”)\nresponded to a 911 hang-up call at 4599 Scott Crossing, Apt. #4, a residence located in\nMemphis, Tennessee. After arriving at the residence and knocking on the door several\ntimes, the Officers encountered Amanda Hensley (“Hensley”) and her boyfriend\nColeman, the Defendant-Appellant.\n\n       Hensley reported to the Officers that she had attempted to call 911 because\nColeman had assaulted her and had refused to let her leave. She also said that, after a\nfight the previous evening, she had ended her relationship with Coleman and left the\nresidence. She returned at approximately 2:00 a.m. the next morning.\n\fNo. 09-5052        United States v. Coleman                                        Page 3\n\n\n       When she returned early on January 4, 2008, Hensley said she encountered\nColeman, who was waiting for her in the dark. Coleman prevented her from leaving the\nresidence by, among other things, barricading the doors with furniture and confiscating\nher cellular phone and car keys. Hensley also said that Coleman had written derogatory\nwords about her on the walls of the residence and that Coleman had physically assaulted\nher by pushing her and pulling her hair.\n\n       After speaking with Hensley at the door, the Officers entered the apartment and\nobserved that it was in disarray. The Officers also observed, in plain view, a mirror with\nmarijuana residue on it, several individual plastic baggies of marijuana and one live\nround of .380 caliber ammunition. Based upon these observations, Coleman was taken\ninto custody and removed from the apartment.\n\n       After Coleman was taken into custody, Hensley signed a consent-to-search form.\nUpon searching the residence, the Officers recovered a large paper bag filled with\nmarijuana and a box of .380 caliber ammunition with 22 live rounds from a drawer\ncontaining Coleman’s underwear and socks. The Officers also recovered two digital\nscales covered with marijuana residue from the kitchen and $1,820 in cash from\nColeman’s person. Overall, the Officers recovered 23 live rounds of .380 caliber\nammunition and 71.7 grams of marijuana from the apartment. Based on this recovery,\nColeman was formally arrested.\n\n       Following Coleman’s arrest, Hensley gave a written statement that Coleman had\nthreatened and assaulted her in the past and that she had seen Coleman sell drugs and\npills. Coleman also gave a written statement in which he denied possessing the\nammunition or selling the marijuana recovered.\n\n       On April 15, 2008, Coleman was indicted by a grand jury that charged him with\ntwo counts of being a felon in possession of ammunition in violation of 18 U.S.C.\n§ 922(g) and one count of possession with intent to distribute marijuana in violation of\n21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1). On September 10, 2008, a change-of-plea hearing was held\nduring which Coleman pled guilty to the two counts for possession of ammunition. As\na condition of the plea, the United States agreed, subject to certain conditions, to\n\fNo. 09-5052        United States v. Coleman                                        Page 4\n\n\nrecommend full acceptance of responsibility and to dismiss count three for possession\nof marijuana with the intent to distribute.\n\n       In Coleman’s Plea Agreement, the United States agreed to recommend full\nacceptance of responsibility credit pursuant to U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual\n(“U.S.S.G.”) § 3E1.1 (2003) with the following caveat:\n\n       The Defendant understands that if the United States receives information\n       between the signing of this agreement and the time of the sentencing that\n       the Defendant has previously engaged in, or if he engages in the future,\n       in conduct inconsistent with the acceptance of responsibility, including,\n       but not limited to, participation of any additional criminal activities\n       between now and the time of sentencing, this position could change.\n\n       Prior to sentencing, a PSR was prepared in which Coleman was initially assigned\na base offense level of 24 and a criminal history category of IV. Coleman’s base offense\nlevel was then increased four levels to 28 for possession of any firearm or ammunition\nin connection with another felony offense. The base offense level was then reduced by\nthree for acceptance of responsibility. Coleman’s offense level pursuant to the PSR,\nthen became 25. Based upon a total offense level of 25 and a criminal history category\nof IV, the PSR recommended that Coleman was in an applicable guideline range of 84\nto 105 months of imprisonment.\n\n       On November 26, 2008, the United States indicated that it had no objections\neither to the facts or calculations in the PSR. On December 22, 2008, Coleman objected\nto the four-level enhancement for possession of ammunition in connection with another\nfelony offense. On December 24, 2008, an Addendum to the PSR concluded that a four-\nlevel enhancement was appropriate.\n\n       On December 30, 2008, a sentencing hearing was held. During this hearing,\nHensley and Kimberly Houston (“Houston”) one of the Officers, testified. When making\ncontact with Hensley the day prior to the sentencing hearing, the United States learned,\nfor the first time, that Coleman, prior to entering his guilty plea on September 10, 2008,\nhad contacted Hensley multiple times using phones at the federal detention facility.\nHensley told the United States that, during one of those phone conversations, Coleman\n\fNo. 09-5052           United States v. Coleman                                      Page 5\n\n\nhad stated, “you got me f--ked up” and “you are not going to be happy out there and I’m\nin here f--ked up.” The United States then filed an amended position paper on the PSR\nrequesting that Coleman’s offense level be enhanced three-levels for obstruction of\njustice.\n\n           At the sentencing hearing, the court determined that under the plain language of\nU.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(b)(6) (2007) and Application Note 14(a), the 23 live rounds of\nammunition facilitated or had the potential of facilitating a felony distribution of\nmarijuana by Coleman. A four-level enhancement was given by the court.\n\n           The court then turned to the three-level enhancement for obstruction of justice\nproposed by the United States. The United States offered Hensley’s testimony that\ndescribed her relationship with Coleman and described various threats that Coleman had\nmade to her. Hensley also provided details about the phone calls that she received from\nColeman while he was incarcerated. She testified that she had been willingly conversing\nwith Coleman for several months but that, when she refused to provide him with names\nand addresses of other criminals, he became angry and threatened her. Hensley also\ntestified that, when making the calls, Coleman would instruct her not to use his name and\nwould use another inmate’s cell phone code or use three-way phone calls to avoid\ndetection on the recordings. Hensley further testified that, after talking with Coleman,\nshe believed that he was threatening her, which led her to change her phone number.\nShe also said that she did not want to testify at the sentencing hearing because Coleman\n“might talk to somebody that would want to do something” to her and her daughter.\n\n           The United States then called Officer Houston who testified that she had\nresponded to several domestic violence calls at Hensley’s residence before the 911 call\nand that, after Coleman was taken into custody on January 4, 2008, Coleman instructed\nHensley not to talk and threatened to kill her. Houston also testified that, when she\nspoke to Hensley immediately prior to the sentencing hearing, Hensley had said that “she\nwas scared about testifying because the [D]efendant, Mr. Coleman, had called her\nmaking threats and was threatening her life.” Houston described Hensley as “nervous\nand scared.”\n\fNo. 09-5052        United States v. Coleman                                       Page 6\n\n\n       The United States then argued that Coleman’s threats were an attempt to scare\nher into not testifying at any future hearing or trial. The United States further argued\nthat Coleman’s attempts to avoid detection on the detention-facility phones should also\nbe considered. The court, however, rejected these arguments and determined that\nColeman’s conduct did not rise to the level of obstruction of justice.\n\n       The United States declined to make a motion for the third-level of acceptance of\nresponsibility based upon the testimony of Hensley and Houston and a reading of the\nportion of the plea agreement addressing acceptance of responsibility. The court then\nawarded Coleman a two-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, which resulted\nin a total offense level of 26 and a criminal history category of IV. Accordingly,\nColeman was assigned a new applicable guideline range of 92 to 115 months.\n\n       Coleman was sentenced to 92 months of imprisonment and three years of\nsupervised release on the two counts of possession of ammunition. As a condition of the\nplea, the United States dismissed count three of the indictment for possession of\nmarijuana.\n\nII.    JURISDICTION\n\n       This is an appeal of a sentence in a criminal case. A Notice of Appeal was timely\nfiled and this appeal is taken pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3742.\n\nIII.   STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n       This Court reviews a district court’s sentence for both procedural and substantive\nunreasonableness. United States v. Bowers, 615 F.3d 715, 725 (6th Cir. 2010).\nProcedural unreasonableness includes “selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous\nfacts ….” Id. (quoting Gall v. United States, 552 U.S. 38, 51 (2007). Substantive\nunreasonableness exists where taking into account the totality of the circumstances, the\nfactors found in § 3553(a), on a whole, do not justify the sentence imposed. Id. (citing\nGall, 552 U.S. at 51).\n\fNo. 09-5052         United States v. Coleman                                         Page 7\n\n\n        When reviewing a sentence, this Court reviews the district court’s factual\nfindings for clear error. United States v. Richardson, 510 F.3d 622, 625 (6th Cir. 2007).\nWhether the facts found warrant the application of a particular guideline provision is a\nlegal question reviewed de novo. Id.\n\n        When a defendant objects or raises an issue before the district court, the issue is\nreviewed on appeal for an abuse of discretion. United States v. Simmons, 587 F.3d 348,\n353 (6th Cir. 2009). When reviewing for an abuse of discretion, the appeals court gives\ndeference to the district court’s decision. Hardyman v. Norfolk & Western Railway Co.,\n243 F.3d 255, (6th Cir. 2001). Only if the appeals court is firmly convinced that the\ndistrict court erred is there a abuse of discretion. Id.\n\n        When a defendant fails to object or raise an issue before the district court, the\nissue is reviewed on appeal for plain error keeping in mind “that the plain error\nexception to the contemporaneous-objection rule is to be used only in those\ncircumstances in which a miscarriage of justice would otherwise result.” United States\nv. Morrow, 977 F.2d 222, 226 (6th Cir. 1992) (citation and internal quotation marks\nomitted). To reverse for plain error, a reviewing court must conduct four distinct\nanalyses: (1) determine whether an error occurred in the district court; (2) if an error\noccurred, determine whether it was plain; (3) determine whether the plain error affected\na substantial right; and (4) if all three exist, decide whether the plain error affected the\nfairness, integrity or public reputation of the judicial proceeding. United States v.\nThomas, 11 F.3d 620, 629-30 (6th Cir. 1993). Finally, a plain error is one that is clear\nor obvious under current law, and an error that affects a substantial right is an error that\naffected the outcome of the district court proceedings. Id.\n\nIV.     DISCUSSION\n\n        Coleman raises two challenges to his sentence. We address each in turn.\n\fNo. 09-5052            United States v. Coleman                                                   Page 8\n\n\nA.       Sentence Enhancement\n\n         Coleman first argues that his possession of ammunition alone did not have the\npotential for facilitating his concomitant drug possession felony because simply\npossessing a bullet without a gun does not aid in the commission of drug possession.\nThus, according to Coleman, his sentence should not have been enhanced pursuant to\nU.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(b)(6).\n\n         The government has the burden of proof to show a factual predicate for this\nsentencing enhancement by a preponderance of the evidence. United States v. Ennenga,\n263 F.3d 499, 503 (6th Cir. 2001). The relevant facts on this issue have been shown by\nthe United States and are not in dispute. Coleman was in possession of 23 live rounds\nof .380 caliber ammunition and was in possession of illegal drugs for the purpose of\ndistribution. Further, the ammunition was found in close proximity to the drugs. The\nissue to be decided is whether or not ammunition standing alone can have the potential\nto facilitate the felony distribution of drugs.\n\n         The relevant Sentencing Guideline relates to increases to the base offense level\nfor unlawful receipt, possession or transportation of firearms or ammunition and\nprovides that, “[i]f the defendant used or possessed any firearm or ammunition in\nconnection with another felony offense…, increase by 4 levels.” U.S.S.G. § 2k2.1(b)(6).\n(Emphasis added.) Application Note 14(A) to this Sentencing Guideline clarifies the\nmeaning of “in connection with” by providing that subsection (b)(6) applies in general\n“if the firearm or ammunition facilitated or had the potential of facilitating another\nfelony offense or another offense, respectively.” (Emphasis added.)\n\n         Thus, applying U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(b)(6) and Note 14(A) thereto, Coleman should\nreceive a four-level enhancement if he possessed any firearm or ammunition in\nconnection with the drug trafficking.1 Coleman does not dispute the drug-trafficking\n\n\n         1\n            U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(b)(6) applies based upon its plain language. The dissent’s interpretation of\nU.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(b)(6) appears to ignore the plain language. The dissent also relies upon an “implication”\nthat it finds in Note 14(B). However, the majority finds no such implication in Note 14(B) which applies\nwhen a firearm is found, which is not the case here.\n\fNo. 09-5052         United States v. Coleman                                        Page 9\n\n\ncharge or that the ammunition was found in proximity to illegal drugs and drug\nparaphernalia. He does, however, dispute that the ammunition, alone, could have been\nused to facilitate a drug transaction.\n\n       A Judge of this Court has, referring to Webster’s Third New International\nDictionary, defined “facilitate” for purposes of U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(b)(6) as to make easier\nor less difficult. Richardson, 510 F.3d at 629 (McKeague concurring). Thus, for\nU.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(b)(6) to apply, Coleman’s possession of the ammunition in close\nproximity to the drugs must make drug trafficking easier or less difficult or have the\npotential to make drug trafficking easier or less difficult.\n\n       There is no binding caselaw directly on point. However the Eleventh Circuit has\nupheld a district court that applied U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(b)(6) where only ammunition was\nfound. See United States v. Chappell, 334 F. App’x 970, 973 (11th Cir. 2009)\n(unpublished) (holding that a district court is entitled to find that ammunition alone had\nthe potential to facilitate felony possession of methamphetamine).\n\n       U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(b)(6) is most often at issue in cases in which a defendant is\nfound to possess a firearm and ammunition. When determining whether a defendant’s\npossession of a firearm is “in connection with” drug trafficking, this Court has adopted\nthe “fortress theory.” Richardson, 510 F.3d at 626. The “fortress theory” provides “that\na connection is established if it reasonably appears that the firearms found on the\npremises controlled or owned by a defendant and in [the defendant’s] actual or\nconstructive possession, are to be used to protect the drugs or otherwise facilitate a drug\ntransaction.” Id. (quoting Ennenga, 263 F.3d at 503 (6th Cir. 2001)). Further, U.S.S.G.\n§ 2K2.1(b)(6) “applies if the firearm had some emboldening role in [a] defendant’s\nfelonious conduct.” United States v. Angel, 576 F.3d 318, 321 (6th Cir. 2009)(quoting\nEnnenga, 263 F.3d at 503)) (internal quotation marks omitted; alteration in original).\n\n       Applying the “fortress theory” reasoning, Coleman’s possession of ammunition\nalone facilitated or had the potential to facilitate felony drug trafficking. Coleman’s\npossession of the ammunition reduced or had the potential to reduce the difficulty of\ncompleting the felony drug trafficking. Not only was the ammunition easily accessible\n\fNo. 09-5052         United States v. Coleman                                      Page 10\n\n\nand stored in close proximity to the illegal drugs, but the ammunition emboldened\nColeman in the knowledge that he was one step closer to having a fully-loaded firearm\nto protect himself and his illegal drugs, and the ammunition potentially served notice to\npotential buyers that Coleman was a step closer to having a fully-loaded firearm.\n\n        In addition to applying this Court’s “fortress theory,” a plain reading of U.S.S.G.\n§ 2K2.1(b)(6) and Application Note 14(A) supports a four-level enhancement for\nColeman. Both U.S.S.G. § 2k2.1(b)(6) and Application Note 14(A) refer to firearms and\nammunition using the disjunctive “or.” If U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1 required that a firearm\nalways be present in order for ammunition to facilitate, this section would use “and”\nbetween the terms firearm and ammunition or would only require that a firearm be\npresent.\n\n        Coleman offers several arguments on this issue. First, he argues that there is no\nclear definition within the Guidelines of the meaning of “facilitated, or had the potential\nof facilitating.”   This is accurate. However, the Court has referred to Webster’s\ndictionary here as it has in many other cases for a definition of “facilitate.”\n\n        Coleman next argues that the underlying justification for the “fortress theory” is\nless compelling when confronted with a defendant who was only in possession of\nammunition because it is unclear how ammunition alone can create a heightened\npossibility of danger during drug transactions. However, without the ammunition, an\nalleged drug dealer would have to take a step that otherwise would not have to be taken -\nobtaining ammunition for a gun. Thus, having the ammunition facilitates or makes\neasier the use of a firearm in a felony drug transaction.\n\n        Coleman next argues that the Guideline provision at issue here is a sentencing\nenhancement that was created in response to a concern about the increased risk of\nviolence when firearms are used or possessed during the commission of a felony. See\ne.g. United States v. Hurst, 228 F.3d 751, 753 (6th Cir. 2000). The presence of\nammunition increases the risk of violence because it puts the owner of the ammunition\none step closer to having a loaded firearm. Thus, the Guideline is clear that an\n\fNo. 09-5052        United States v. Coleman                                       Page 11\n\n\nenhancement is in order for the presence of a weapon or ammunition. The Guideline\ndoes not require the presence of a weapon and ammunition.\n\n       Coleman next argues that violence was not more likely to occur in the present\nsituation because ammunition without a firearm is merely a static object that can do little\nor no harm to anyone. First, the Guideline does not talk about whether or not violence\nis more likely to occur, and its purpose is to address a concern about the increased risk\nof violence.   The Sentencing Guideline addresses the presence of a weapon or\nammunition. Also, applying Coleman’s reasoning, an unloaded weapon would be a\nstatic object so only a loaded weapon could result in a four-level enhancement which is\nan absurd result and not the result intended by the Sentencing Guidelines.\n\n       Coleman’s next argument is that the district court’s application of the\n“emboldening” test is unpersuasive and an inappropriate “theoretical leap” because the\ndistrict court’s conclusion of exactly how the possession of ammunition alone would\nfacilitate or embolden him was based upon pure speculation as to what might have\nhappened in the future. However, the district court’s reasoning was based upon present\nand unchallenged facts as required by the applicable Guideline. The speculation, if there\nwas any, was but a mere example of why the applicable Guideline says weapon or\nammunition instead of weapon and ammunition.\n\n       Coleman’s final argument is that ammunition alone has no potential for making\nany other felony easier or less difficult to complete because, without a firearm,\nammunition can do nothing. Without accepting Coleman’s premise that ammunition\ncan do nothing without a firearm, this Court has already determined above that\nammunition can facilitate the commission of a felony.\n\n       In conclusion, based upon an application of the “fortress theory” and a plain\nreading of U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(b)(6) and Application Note 14(A), the four-level\nenhancement given to Coleman was legally correct. Further, the Eleventh Circuit has\nalready upheld a district court’s application of the four-level enhancement where only\n\fNo. 09-5052        United States v. Coleman                                       Page 12\n\n\nammunition was found. Finally, the district judge’s fact-finding in this matter has not\nbeen shown to be clearly erroneous.\n\nB.     Sentence Reduction\n\n       Coleman’s second issue presented for review is that the district court erred in\ndenying him the third level of a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility\nunder U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1(b) because the government’s justification for refusing to make\nthe motion was arbitrary and unrelated to the timing of his Plea. Coleman did not raise\nthis issue below. Thus, the district court’s decision on this issue is reviewed for plain\nerror. Morrow, 977 F.2d at 226.\n\n       U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1(b) provides that, upon motion by the government stating that\nthe defendant has assisted authorities in the investigation or prosecution of his own\nmisconduct by timely notifying authorities of his intention to enter a guilty plea, thereby\npermitting the government to avoid preparing for trial, and if the defendant qualifies for\na decrease due to acceptance of responsibility and the offense level is 16 or greater, the\noffense level will be decreased by 1. Further, Application Note 6 to § 3E1.1 provides,\nin relevant part, that the one-level reduction may be granted only upon a formal motion\nby the government at the time of sentencing.\n\n       The Sixth Circuit has interpreted § 3E1.1, along with Application Note 6, to\nmean that the government’s discretion to file the motion is limited only by an\nunconstitutionally impermissible motive or if it is arbitrary. United States v. Lapsins,\n570 F.3d 758, 770 (6th Cir. 2009). In Lapsins, the defendant sought a three-level\nreduction for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to § 3E1.1 The district court granted\na two-level reduction, the government did not move for an additional one-level\nreduction, and Lapsins appealed. On appeal, Lapsins argued that he was entitled to the\nthird-level reduction because he had accepted responsibility and his decision to plead\nguilty permitted the government to avoid preparing for a trial. Id. at 768. This Court\nfound that “the government may decline to move for a reduction under § 3E1.1(b) so\nlong as the decision does not rest on a constitutionally impermissible factor and is not\narbitrary.” Id. at 770. This Court then went on to conclude that the government believed\n\fNo. 09-5052            United States v. Coleman                                      Page 13\n\n\nin good faith that Lapsins had not accepted responsibility. Id. at 771. As a result, the\ngovernment’s decision not to move for the reduction was not arbitrary and was thus\npermissible. Id.\n\n            In Lapsins, the government objected to any reduction for acceptance of\nresponsibility, but the district court granted a two-level reduction based upon the\ndefendant’s statement of facts and guilty plea. However, the district court did not award\nthe third level because the government did not move for the third level. The district\ncourt’s decision was upheld by this Court.\n\n            In this case, Coleman’s offense level was 16 or more and the Court found that\nhe was entitled to a two-level reduction. The United States argued for no reduction\nbecause Coleman had obstructed justice. The district granted the two-level reduction\nbecause it determined that Coleman had not obstructed justice and had pled guilty prior\nto trial.\n\n            The United States then declined to move for the third-level reduction based upon\nthe information that it had first received the day prior to the sentencing hearing from\nHensley that Coleman had threatened her on the telephone in July of 2008. The decision\nnot to move for a third-level reduction, according to the United States, was based upon\nits “genuine and good faith belief” that Coleman’s threatening telephone call to Hensley\nin July of 2008 was inconsistent with acceptance of responsibility.\n\n            Coleman first argues that, because the conduct cited by the United States did not\namount to obstruction of justice, its justification for refusing to move for the third level\nreduction was arbitrary. However, the reason given by the United States was not that\nColeman’s conduct was an obstruction of justice, although the United States argued\nunsuccessfully that it was. The reason given by the United States was that Coleman’s\nactions indicated that he had not accepted responsibility. This justification was based\nupon a reasonable belief and was thus not arbitrary.\n\n            Coleman next argues, based upon this Court’s ruling in United States v.\nRobertson, 260 F.3d 500 (6th Cir. 2001), that the government is required to move for the\n\fNo. 09-5052         United States v. Coleman                                      Page 14\n\n\nthird-level reduction so long as he can demonstrate that the offense level determined\nprior to consideration of acceptance of responsibility was 16 or greater and he timely\nnotified the government of his intent to plead guilty. However, as this Court has later\nexplained, the government may refuse to move for the third-level reduction so long as\nthe government’s reason for refusal is not based upon a constitutionally impermissible\nfactor and is not arbitrary.\n\n        Coleman next argues that, where the government’s justification for refusal to\nmove for the third-level reduction is wholly unrelated to the timing of his plea as\ncompared to preparation for trial, a court should show no deference to the government’s\ncontention that he did not fully accept responsibility unless the government objected to\nhim receiving a reduction under § 3E1.1(a). This argument, too, is without merit. The\ncourt may show deference to the government’s reasons for not seeking a third-level\nreduction even if the reasons have nothing to do with the timing between the plea and\ntrial, so long as the refusal is not based upon a constitutionally impermissible factor and\nis not arbitrary.\n\n        Given that there was evidence presented that Coleman threatened Hensley and\nthat Hensley was scared to testify at the sentencing hearing because of what Coleman\nmight do to her, the United States had reason to believe in good faith that Coleman had\nnot accepted responsibility. Applying this Court’s reasoning in Lapsins to the present\nmatter, the United States was not required to move for the third level reduction because\nits reason for not doing so was not arbitrary. The United States, in good faith, had\nreason to believe that Coleman had not accepted responsibility. Thus, there was no error\nby the district court, let alone a “plain error.”\n\nV.      CONCLUSION\n\n        The trial court did not err in applying a four-level enhancement for possession\nof ammunition. The trial court also did not err in failing to grant the third-level\nreduction for acceptance of responsibility. For these reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment\nof the district court.\n\fNo. 09-5052         United States v. Coleman                                        Page 15\n\n\n            ___________________________________________________\n\n             CONCURRING IN PART AND DISSENTING IN PART\n            ___________________________________________________\n\n        GILMAN, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part. I agree that\nthe district court did not err in failing to grant Coleman the third-level reduction for\nacceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G § 3E1.1(b). The reasoning in Judge Rose’s\nopinion on this issue strikes me as sound, and I therefore concur. On the other hand, I\ndisagree with the majority’s justification for applying the four-level enhancement under\nU.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(b)(6) for Coleman’s possession of ammunition.                  I therefore\nrespectfully dissent on this latter issue.\n\n        How the possession of nothing but bullets, absent a gun, facilitates or has the\npotential to facilitate the offense of possessing marijuana is beyond me. The sentencing\ntranscript indicates that the district court also had difficulty concluding that ammunition\nalone had the potential to facilitate the marijuana offense. Although it ultimately applied\nthe four-level enhancement, the district court acknowledged that having ammunition\nwithout a gun is “like having . . . kindling without the match. You can have the kindling\nall day long; but if you don’t have the match, you can’t start the fire.”\n\n        The majority opinion sets forth two justifications for affirming the district court’s\ndetermination. First, the majority asserts without explanation that the language of\nU.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(b)(6) is “plain.” Maj. Op. at 9 n.1. The language of that section,\nhowever, is anything but plain in my opinion. Section 2K2.1(b)(6) specifies that the\nfour-level enhancement should apply “[i]f the defendant used or possessed any firearm\nor ammunition in connection with another felony offense.” Application Note 14(A) then\ndefines the phrase “in connection with” to mean that “the firearm or ammunition\nfacilitated, or had the potential of facilitating, another felony offense.”         Section\n2K2.1(b)(6) thus requires that a court do more than blindly apply the four-level\nenhancement whenever ammunition is found in close proximity to illegal drugs. Instead,\nthe district court must analyze, on a case-by-case basis, whether the proximity of\n\fNo. 09-5052        United States v. Coleman                                       Page 16\n\n\nammunition alone facilitated or had the potential to facilitate the drug offense. I\ntherefore find that the language of U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(b)(6) is far from plain.\n\n       The majority opinion’s second justification for affirming the judgment of the\ndistrict court boils down to saying that “the ammunition emboldened Coleman in the\nknowledge that he was one step closer to having a fully-loaded firearm to protect himself\nand his illegal drugs, and the ammunition potentially served notice to potential buyers\nthat Coleman was a step closer to having a fully-loaded firearm.” Maj. Op. at 10. But\nthis “one step closer” argument does not withstand scrutiny. The record contains no\nevidence that Coleman had a gun anywhere around, and bullets alone could hardly\nembolden him or scare potential buyers who might be inclined to steal his marijuana.\n\n       Many things could in theory put a person “one step closer” to having a firearm,\nsuch as applying for a firearms permit, having a holster, possessing a laser scope, or\nearning money to be able to purchase a weapon. But only actual possession of a firearm\nwould potentially “facilitate” drug dealing under this court’s “fortress theory,” because\ndisplaying bullets alone can cause no harm. On the other hand, displaying a gun would\ndefinitely intimidate someone intending to steal the seller’s drugs. And this is true even\nif the gun is unloaded, because the person staring down the barrel of a gun has no way\nof knowing whether it is loaded or unloaded. The district court clearly recognized this\npoint: “If I have a gun that is not loaded and I point my gun at you, you don’t know\nwhether my gun is loaded or not. If I have a bullet and I point my bullet at you, you\nknow that I don’t have a gun.” This refutes the majority’s contention that Coleman’s\nreasoning leads to the “absurd result” that only a loaded gun could result in a four-level\nenhancement. Maj. Op. at 11. Coleman in fact does not make such an argument.\n\n       Section 2K2.1(b)(6) and Application Note 14(A) do, as the majority repeatedly\nemphasizes, refer to firearm and ammunition in the disjunctive. But Application Note\n14(B), whose relevance the majority fails to acknowledge, links the fortress theory solely\nto the possession of a firearm. It reads as follows:\n\n       Application When Other Offense is Burglary or Drug\n       Offense.–Subsection[](b)(6) . . . appl[ies] . . . in the case of a drug\n\fNo. 09-5052        United States v. Coleman                                       Page 17\n\n\n       trafficking offense in which a firearm is found in close proximity to\n       drugs, drug manufacturing materials, or drug paraphernalia. In these\n       cases, application of subsection[] (b)(6) . . . is warranted because the\n       presence of the firearm has the potential of facilitating another felony\n       offense . . . .\n\nApplication Note 14(B)’s limitation to a firearm implies that the fortress theory does not\napply to the possession of ammunition. Unlike drug-trafficking cases where a firearm\nis found in close proximity to the drugs, there is no presumption of facilitation where\nammunition alone is found. Rather, under Application Note 14(A), a district court must\ndetermine if the ammunition actually facilitated the commission of another felony\noffense.\n\n       This is not to say that the possession of ammunition alone could never facilitate\nanother felony offense. The four-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(b)(6) could\napply to the possession of ammunition alone, for example, where two conspirators plan\nto rob, say, a bank, with one to bring a gun and the other to bring the ammunition for the\ngun. In this hypothetical, the one possessing the ammunition could clearly be found to\nhave facilitated the crime of bank robbery, and thus be subject to the four-level\nenhancement. But that is not the situation in the case before us.\n\n       As the majority notes, “[t]here is no binding caselaw directly on point.” Maj. Op.\nat 9. The only case it can find that supports the enhancement under circumstances\nsimilar to those at hand is the unreported Eleventh Circuit case of United States v.\nChappell, 334 F. App’x 970 (11th Cir. 2009). Maj. Op. at 9,12. But Chappell is a three-\npage per curiam opinion that contains no reasoning at all on the issue in question. The\ntotal analysis in Chappell on the application of U.S.S.G. § 2K1.1(b)(6) is the following:\n\n       The record also supports the enhancement of Chappell’s sentence for\n       possessing ammunition in connection with another felony offense. A\n       defendant is subject to a four-level enhancement if he “used or possessed\n       any firearm or ammunition in connection with another felony offense.”\n       U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(b)(6). The enhancement applies “if the firearm or\n       ammunition facilitated, or had the potential of facilitating, another felony\n       offense.” Id. cmt. n. 14(A). The district court was entitled to find that\n       the ammunition had the potential to facilitate Chappell’s felony\n\fNo. 09-5052        United States v. Coleman                                      Page 18\n\n\n       possession of methamphetamine. In the absence of a contrary\n       interpretation from this Court or the Supreme Court, the district court did\n       not plainly err by applying the enhancement.\n\nId. at 973 (alterations omitted).\n\n       The present case, therefore, is the first and only published decision in the entire\ncountry applying the four-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(b)(6) where the\npossession of ammunition alone is deemed to facilitate the crime of drug dealing.\nBecause there appears to me no logical support for such a conclusion in this case, I\nrespectfully dissent.\n\f",

GILMAN, J. (pp. 215-18), delivered a separate opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>OPINION</h2>\n<p>ROSE, District Judge.</p>\n<p>On September 10, 2008, Antonius Coleman (\"Coleman\") pled guilty to two counts <span class=\"star-pagination\">*208</span> of being a felon in possession of ammunition. As a condition for the plea, the United States agreed, subject to certain conditions, to recommend full acceptance of responsibility and to dismiss a possession-of-marijuana count. At sentencing, Coleman was given a four-level enhancement for possessing 23 live rounds of ammunition that facilitated or had the potential to facilitate a felony distribution of marijuana. Coleman was given a two-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, but the United States declined to make a motion for the third-level of reduction for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n<p>Coleman appealed the four-level enhancement for possessing the 23 rounds of live ammunition and the United States' refusal to make a motion for a third-level of reduction for acceptance of responsibility to this Court. For the following reasons, we AFFIRM Coleman's sentence.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>The facts underlying the relevant criminal conduct in this case are not in dispute and are reflected in the Presentence Report (the \"PSR\"). On January 4, 2008, at approximately 9:50 p.m., Memphis Police Department Officers (the \"Officers\") responded to a 911 hang-up call at 4599 Scott Crossing, Apt. # 4, a residence located in Memphis, Tennessee. After arriving at the residence and knocking on the door several times, the Officers encountered Amanda Hensley (\"Hensley\") and her boyfriend Coleman, the Defendant-Appellant.</p>\n<p>Hensley reported to the Officers that she had attempted to call 911 because Coleman had assaulted her and had refused to let her leave. She also said that, after a fight the previous evening, she had ended her relationship with Coleman and left the residence. She returned at approximately 2:00 a.m. the next morning.</p>\n<p>When she returned early on January 4, 2008, Hensley said she encountered Coleman, who was waiting for her in the dark. Coleman prevented her from leaving the residence by, among other things, barricading the doors with furniture and confiscating her cellular phone and car keys. Hensley also said that Coleman had written derogatory words about her on the walls of the residence and that Coleman had physically assaulted her by pushing her and pulling her hair.</p>\n<p>After speaking with Hensley at the door, the Officers entered the apartment and observed that it was in disarray. The Officers also observed, in plain view, a mirror with marijuana residue on it, several individual plastic baggies of marijuana and one live round of .380 caliber ammunition. Based upon these observations, Coleman was taken into custody and removed from the apartment.</p>\n<p>After Coleman was taken into custody, Hensley signed a consent-to-search form. Upon searching the residence, the Officers recovered a large paper bag filled with marijuana and a box of .380 caliber ammunition with 22 live rounds from a drawer containing Coleman's underwear and socks. The Officers also recovered two digital scales covered with marijuana residue from the kitchen and $1,820 in cash from Coleman's person. Overall, the Officers recovered 23 live rounds of .380 caliber ammunition and 71.7 grams of marijuana from the apartment. Based on this recovery, Coleman was formally arrested.</p>\n<p>Following Coleman's arrest, Hensley gave a written statement that Coleman had threatened and assaulted her in the past and that she had seen Coleman sell drugs and pills. Coleman also gave a written statement in which he denied possessing the ammunition or selling the marijuana recovered.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*209</span> On April 15, 2008, Coleman was indicted by a grand jury that charged him with two counts of being a felon in possession of ammunition in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g) and one count of possession with intent to distribute marijuana in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1). On September 10, 2008, a change-of-plea hearing was held during which Coleman pled guilty to the two counts for possession of ammunition. As a condition of the plea, the United States agreed, subject to certain conditions, to recommend full acceptance of responsibility and to dismiss count three for possession of marijuana with the intent to distribute.</p>\n<p>In Coleman's Plea Agreement, the United States agreed to recommend full acceptance of responsibility credit pursuant to U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual (\"U.S.S.G.\") § 3E1.1 (2003) with the following caveat:</p>\n<blockquote>The Defendant understands that if the United States receives information between the signing of this agreement and the time of the sentencing that the Defendant has previously engaged in, or if he engages in the future, in conduct inconsistent with the acceptance of responsibility, including, but not limited to, participation of any additional criminal activities between now and the time of sentencing, this position could change.</blockquote>\n<p>Prior to sentencing, a PSR was prepared in which Coleman was initially assigned a base offense level of 24 and a criminal history category of IV. Coleman's base offense level was then increased four levels to 28 for possession of any firearm or ammunition in connection with another felony offense. The base offense level was then reduced by three for acceptance of responsibility. Coleman's offense level pursuant to the PSR, then became 25. Based upon a total offense level of 25 and a criminal history category of IV, the PSR recommended that Coleman was in an applicable guideline range of 84 to 105 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p>On November 26, 2008, the United States indicated that it had no objections either to the facts or calculations in the PSR. On December 22, 2008, Coleman objected to the four-level enhancement for possession of ammunition in connection with another felony offense. On December 24, 2008, an Addendum to the PSR concluded that a four-level enhancement was appropriate.</p>\n<p>On December 30, 2008, a sentencing hearing was held. During this hearing, Hensley and Kimberly Houston (\"Houston\") one of the Officers, testified. When making contact with Hensley the day prior to the sentencing hearing, the United States learned, for the first time, that Coleman, prior to entering his guilty plea on September 10, 2008, had contacted Hensley multiple times using phones at the federal detention facility. Hensley told the United States that, during one of those phone conversations, Coleman had stated, \"you got me fked up\" and \"you are not going to be happy out there and I'm in here fked up.\" The United States then filed an amended position paper on the PSR requesting that Coleman's offense level be enhanced three-levels for obstruction of justice.</p>\n<p>At the sentencing hearing, the court determined that under the plain language of U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(b)(6) (2007) and Application Note 14(a), the 23 live rounds of ammunition facilitated or had the potential of facilitating a felony distribution of marijuana by Coleman. A four-level enhancement was given by the court.</p>\n<p>The court then turned to the three-level enhancement for obstruction of justice proposed by the United States. The United States offered Hensley's testimony that described her relationship with Coleman <span class=\"star-pagination\">*210</span> and described various threats that Coleman had made to her. Hensley also provided details about the phone calls that she received from Coleman while he was incarcerated. She testified that she had been willingly conversing with Coleman for several months but that, when she refused to provide him with names and addresses of other criminals, he became angry and threatened her. Hensley also testified that, when making the calls, Coleman would instruct her not to use his name and would use another inmate's cell phone code or use three-way phone calls to avoid detection on the recordings. Hensley further testified that, after talking with Coleman, she believed that he was threatening her, which led her to change her phone number. She also said that she did not want to testify at the sentencing hearing because Coleman \"might talk to somebody that would want to do something\" to her and her daughter.</p>\n<p>The United States then called Officer Houston who testified that she had responded to several domestic violence calls at Hensley's residence before the 911 call and that, after Coleman was taken into custody on January 4, 2008, Coleman instructed Hensley not to talk and threatened to kill her. Houston also testified that, when she spoke to Hensley immediately prior to the sentencing hearing, Hensley had said that \"she was scared about testifying because the [D]efendant, Mr. Coleman, had called her making threats and was threatening her life.\" Houston described Hensley as \"nervous and scared.\"</p>\n<p>The United States then argued that Coleman's threats were an attempt to scare her into not testifying at any future hearing or trial. The United States further argued that Coleman's attempts to avoid detection on the detention-facility phones should also be considered. The court, however, rejected these arguments and determined that Coleman's conduct did not rise to the level of obstruction of justice.</p>\n<p>The United States declined to make a motion for the third-level of acceptance of responsibility based upon the testimony of Hensley and Houston and a reading of the portion of the plea agreement addressing acceptance of responsibility. The court then awarded Coleman a two-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, which resulted in a total offense level of 26 and a criminal history category of IV. Accordingly, Coleman was assigned a new applicable guideline range of 92 to 115 months.</p>\n<p>Coleman was sentenced to 92 months of imprisonment and three years of supervised release on the two counts of possession of ammunition. As a condition of the plea, the United States dismissed count three of the indictment for possession of marijuana.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. JURISDICTION</h2>\n<p>This is an appeal of a sentence in a criminal case. A Notice of Appeal was timely filed and this appeal is taken pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3742.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. STANDARD OF REVIEW</h2>\n<p>This Court reviews a district court's sentence for both procedural and substantive unreasonableness. <i>United States v. Bowers,</i> 615 F.3d 715, 725 (6th Cir.2010). Procedural unreasonableness includes \"selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts. ...\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Gall v. United States,</i> 552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)). Substantive unreasonableness exists where taking into account the totality of the circumstances, the factors found in § 3553(a), on a whole, do not justify the sentence imposed. <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>Gall,</i> 552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*211</span> When reviewing a sentence, this Court reviews the district court's factual findings for clear error. <i>United States v. Richardson,</i> 510 F.3d 622, 625 (6th Cir. 2007). Whether the facts found warrant the application of a particular guideline provision is a legal question reviewed de novo. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>When a defendant objects or raises an issue before the district court, the issue is reviewed on appeal for an abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. Simmons,</i> 587 F.3d 348, 353 (6th Cir.2009). When reviewing for an abuse of discretion, the appeals court gives deference to the district court's decision. <i>Hardyman v. Norfolk &amp; Western Railway Co.,</i> 243 F.3d 255, (6th Cir.2001). Only if the appeals court is firmly convinced that the district court erred is there a abuse of discretion. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>When a defendant fails to object or raise an issue before the district court, the issue is reviewed on appeal for plain error keeping in mind \"that the plain error exception to the contemporaneous-objection rule is to be used only in those circumstances in which a miscarriage of justice would otherwise result.\" <i>United States v. Morrow,</i> 977 F.2d 222, 226 (6th Cir. 1992) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). To reverse for plain error, a reviewing court must conduct four distinct analyses: (1) determine whether an error occurred in the district court; (2) if an error occurred, determine whether it was plain; (3) determine whether the plain error affected a substantial right; and (4) if all three exist, decide whether the plain error affected the fairness, integrity or public reputation of the judicial proceeding. <i>United States v. Thomas,</i> 11 F.3d 620, 629-30 (6th Cir.1993). Finally, a plain error is one that is clear or obvious under current law, and an error that affects a substantial right is an error that affected the outcome of the district court proceedings. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV. DISCUSSION</h2>\n<p>Coleman raises two challenges to his sentence. We address each in turn.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Sentence Enhancement</h2>\n<p>Coleman first argues that his possession of ammunition alone did not have the potential for facilitating his concomitant drug possession felony because simply possessing a bullet without a gun does not aid in the commission of drug possession. Thus, according to Coleman, his sentence should not have been enhanced pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(b)(6).</p>\n<p>The government has the burden of proof to show a factual predicate for this sentencing enhancement by a preponderance of the evidence. <i>United States v. Ennenga,</i> 263 F.3d 499, 503 (6th Cir.2001). The relevant facts on this issue have been shown by the United States and are not in dispute. Coleman was in possession of 23 live rounds of .380 caliber ammunition and was in possession of illegal drugs for the purpose of distribution. Further, the ammunition was found in close proximity to the drugs. The issue to be decided is whether or not ammunition standing alone can have the potential to facilitate the felony distribution of drugs.</p>\n<p>The relevant Sentencing Guideline relates to increases to the base offense level for unlawful receipt, possession or transportation of firearms or ammunition and provides that, \"[i]f the defendant used or possessed any firearm or ammunition in connection with another felony offense ..., increase by 4 levels.\" U.S.S.G. § 2k2.1(b)(6). (Emphasis added.) Application Note 14(A) to this Sentencing Guideline clarifies the meaning of \"in connection with\" by providing that subsection <span class=\"star-pagination\">*212</span> (b)(6) applies in general \"if the firearm or ammunition facilitated or had the potential of facilitating another felony offense or another offense, respectively.\" (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p>Thus, applying U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(b)(6) and Note 14(A) thereto, Coleman should receive a four-level enhancement if he possessed any firearm or ammunition in connection with the drug trafficking.<sup>[1]</sup> Coleman does not dispute the drug-trafficking charge or that the ammunition was found in proximity to illegal drugs and drug paraphernalia. He does, however, dispute that the ammunition, alone, could have been used to facilitate a drug transaction.</p>\n<p>A Judge of this Court has, referring to Webster's Third New International Dictionary, defined \"facilitate\" for purposes of U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(b)(6) as to make easier or less difficult. <i>Richardson,</i> 510 F.3d at 629 (McKeague concurring). Thus, for U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(b)(6) to apply, Coleman's possession of the ammunition in close proximity to the drugs must make drug trafficking easier or less difficult or have the potential to make drug trafficking easier or less difficult.</p>\n<p>There is no binding caselaw directly on point. However the Eleventh Circuit has upheld a district court that applied U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(b)(6) where only ammunition was found. <i>See United States v. Chappell,</i> 334 Fed.Appx. 970, 973 (11th Cir.2009) (unpublished) (holding that a district court is entitled to find that ammunition alone had the potential to facilitate felony possession of methamphetamine).</p>\n<p>U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(b)(6) is most often at issue in cases in which a defendant is found to possess a firearm and ammunition. When determining whether a defendant's possession of a firearm is \"in connection with\" drug trafficking, this Court has adopted the \"fortress theory.\" <i>Richardson,</i> 510 F.3d at 626. The \"fortress theory\" provides \"that a connection is established if it reasonably appears that the firearms found on the premises controlled or owned by a defendant and in [the defendant's] actual or constructive possession, are to be used to protect the drugs or otherwise facilitate a drug transaction.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Ennenga,</i> 263 F.3d at 503 (6th Cir.2001)). Further, U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(b)(6) \"applies if the firearm had some emboldening role in [a] defendant's felonious conduct.\" <i>United States v. Angel,</i> 576 F.3d 318, 321 (6th Cir.2009)(quoting <i>Ennenga,</i> 263 F.3d at 503) (internal quotation marks omitted; alteration in original).</p>\n<p>Applying the \"fortress theory\" reasoning, Coleman's possession of ammunition alone facilitated or had the potential to facilitate felony drug trafficking. Coleman's possession of the ammunition reduced or had the potential to reduce the difficulty of completing the felony drug trafficking. Not only was the ammunition easily accessible and stored in close proximity to the illegal drugs, but the ammunition emboldened Coleman in the knowledge that he was one step closer to having a fully-loaded firearm to protect himself and his illegal drugs, and the ammunition potentially served notice to potential buyers that Coleman was a step closer to having a fully-loaded firearm.</p>\n<p>In addition to applying this Court's \"fortress theory,\" a plain reading of U.S.S.G. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*213</span> § 2K2.1(b)(6) and Application Note 14(A) supports a four-level enhancement for Coleman. Both U.S.S.G. § 2k2.1(b)(6) and Application Note 14(A) refer to firearms and ammunition using the disjunctive \"or.\" If U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1 required that a firearm always be present in order for ammunition to facilitate, this section would use \"and\" between the terms firearm and ammunition or would only require that a firearm be present.</p>\n<p>Coleman offers several arguments on this issue. First, he argues that there is no clear definition within the Guidelines of the meaning of \"facilitated, or had the potential of facilitating.\" This is accurate. However, the Court has referred to Webster's dictionary here as it has in many other cases for a definition of \"facilitate.\"</p>\n<p>Coleman next argues that the underlying justification for the \"fortress theory\" is less compelling when confronted with a defendant who was only in possession of ammunition because it is unclear how ammunition alone can create a heightened possibility of danger during drug transactions. However, without the ammunition, an alleged drug dealer would have to take a step that otherwise would not have to be taken  obtaining ammunition for a gun. Thus, having the ammunition facilitates or makes easier the use of a firearm in a felony drug transaction.</p>\n<p>Coleman next argues that the Guideline provision at issue here is a sentencing enhancement that was created in response to a concern about the increased risk of violence when firearms are used or possessed during the commission of a felony. <i>See e.g. </i><i>United States v. Hurst,</i> 228 F.3d 751, 753 (6th Cir.2000). The presence of ammunition increases the risk of violence because it puts the owner of the ammunition one step closer to having a loaded firearm. Thus, the Guideline is clear that an enhancement is in order for the presence of a weapon or ammunition. The Guideline does not require the presence of a weapon and ammunition.</p>\n<p>Coleman next argues that violence was not more likely to occur in the present situation because ammunition without a firearm is merely a static object that can do little or no harm to anyone. First, the Guideline does not talk about whether or not violence is more likely to occur, and its purpose is to address a concern about the increased risk of violence. The Sentencing Guideline addresses the presence of a weapon or ammunition. Also, applying Coleman's reasoning, an unloaded weapon would be a static object so only a loaded weapon could result in a four-level enhancement which is an absurd result and not the result intended by the Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n<p>Coleman's next argument is that the district court's application of the \"emboldening\" test is unpersuasive and an inappropriate \"theoretical leap\" because the district court's conclusion of exactly how the possession of ammunition alone would facilitate or embolden him was based upon pure speculation as to what might have happened in the future. However, the district court's reasoning was based upon present and unchallenged facts as required by the applicable Guideline. The speculation, if there was any, was but a mere example of why the applicable Guideline says weapon <i>or</i> ammunition instead of weapon and ammunition.</p>\n<p>Coleman's final argument is that ammunition alone has no potential for making any other felony easier or less difficult to complete because, without a firearm, ammunition can do nothing. Without accepting Coleman's premise that ammunition can do nothing without a firearm, this Court has already determined above that ammunition can facilitate the commission of a felony.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*214</span> In conclusion, based upon an application of the \"fortress theory\" and a plain reading of U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(b)(6) and Application Note 14(A), the four-level enhancement given to Coleman was legally correct. Further, the Eleventh Circuit has already upheld a district court's application of the four-level enhancement where only ammunition was found. Finally, the district judge's fact-finding in this matter has not been shown to be clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Sentence Reduction</h2>\n<p>Coleman's second issue presented for review is that the district court erred in denying him the third level of a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1(b) because the government's justification for refusing to make the motion was arbitrary and unrelated to the timing of his Plea. Coleman did not raise this issue below. Thus, the district court's decision on this issue is reviewed for plain error. <i>Morrow,</i> 977 F.2d at 226.</p>\n<p>U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1(b) provides that, upon motion by the government stating that the defendant has assisted authorities in the investigation or prosecution of his own misconduct by timely notifying authorities of his intention to enter a guilty plea, thereby permitting the government to avoid preparing for trial, and if the defendant qualifies for a decrease due to acceptance of responsibility and the offense level is 16 or greater, the offense level will be decreased by 1. Further, Application Note 6 to § 3E1.1 provides, in relevant part, that the one-level reduction may be granted only upon a formal motion by the government at the time of sentencing.</p>\n<p>The Sixth Circuit has interpreted § 3E1.1, along with Application Note 6, to mean that the government's discretion to file the motion is limited only by an unconstitutionally impermissible motive or if it is arbitrary. <i>United States v. Lapsins,</i> 570 F.3d 758, 770 (6th Cir.2009). In <i>Lapsins,</i> the defendant sought a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to § 3E1.1. The district court granted a two-level reduction, the government did not move for an additional one-level reduction, and <i>Lapsins</i> appealed. On appeal, <i>Lapsins</i> argued that he was entitled to the third-level reduction because he had accepted responsibility and his decision to plead guilty permitted the government to avoid preparing for a trial. <i>Id.</i> at 768. This Court found that \"the government may decline to move for a reduction under § 3E1.1(b) so long as the decision does not rest on a constitutionally impermissible factor and is not arbitrary.\" <i>Id.</i> at 770. This Court then went on to conclude that the government believed in good faith that <i>Lapsins</i> had not accepted responsibility. <i>Id.</i> at 771. As a result, the government's decision not to move for the reduction was not arbitrary and was thus permissible. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>In <i>Lapsins,</i> the government objected to any reduction for acceptance of responsibility, but the district court granted a two-level reduction based upon the defendant's statement of facts and guilty plea. However, the district court did not award the third level because the government did not move for the third level. The district court's decision was upheld by this Court.</p>\n<p>In this case, Coleman's offense level was 16 or more and the Court found that he was entitled to a two-level reduction. The United States argued for no reduction because Coleman had obstructed justice. The district granted the two-level reduction because it determined that Coleman had not obstructed justice and had pled guilty prior to trial.</p>\n<p>The United States then declined to move for the third-level reduction based upon the information that it had first received <span class=\"star-pagination\">*215</span> the day prior to the sentencing hearing from Hensley that Coleman had threatened her on the telephone in July of 2008. The decision not to move for a third-level reduction, according to the United States, was based upon its \"genuine and good faith belief\" that Coleman's threatening telephone call to Hensley in July of 2008 was inconsistent with acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n<p>Coleman first argues that, because the conduct cited by the United States did not amount to obstruction of justice, its justification for refusing to move for the third level reduction was arbitrary. However, the reason given by the United States was not that Coleman's conduct was an obstruction of justice, although the United States argued unsuccessfully that it was. The reason given by the United States was that Coleman's actions indicated that he had not accepted responsibility. This justification was based upon a reasonable belief and was thus not arbitrary.</p>\n<p>Coleman next argues, based upon this Court's ruling in <i>United States v. Robertson,</i> 260 F.3d 500 (6th Cir.2001), that the government is required to move for the third-level reduction so long as he can demonstrate that the offense level determined prior to consideration of acceptance of responsibility was 16 or greater and he timely notified the government of his intent to plead guilty. However, as this Court has later explained, the government may refuse to move for the third-level reduction so long as the government's reason for refusal is not based upon a constitutionally impermissible factor and is not arbitrary.</p>\n<p>Coleman next argues that, where the government's justification for refusal to move for the third-level reduction is wholly unrelated to the timing of his plea as compared to preparation for trial, a court should show no deference to the government's contention that he did not fully accept responsibility unless the government objected to him receiving a reduction under § 3E1.1(a). This argument, too, is without merit. The court may show deference to the government's reasons for not seeking a third-level reduction even if the reasons have nothing to do with the timing between the plea and trial, so long as the refusal is not based upon a constitutionally impermissible factor and is not arbitrary.</p>\n<p>Given that there was evidence presented that Coleman threatened Hensley and that Hensley was scared to testify at the sentencing hearing because of what Coleman might do to her, the United States had reason to believe in good faith that Coleman had not accepted responsibility. Applying this Court's reasoning in <i>Lapsins</i> to the present matter, the United States was not required to move for the third level reduction because its reason for not doing so was not arbitrary. The United States, in good faith, had reason to believe that Coleman had not accepted responsibility. Thus, there was no error by the district court, let alone a \"plain error.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>V. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The trial court did not err in applying a four-level enhancement for possession of ammunition. The trial court also did not err in failing to grant the third-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility. For these reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p>GILMAN, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p>I agree that the district court did not err in failing to grant Coleman the third-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1(b). The reasoning in Judge Rose's opinion on this issue strikes me as sound, and I therefore concur. On the other hand, I disagree with <span class=\"star-pagination\">*216</span> the majority's justification for applying the four-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(b)(6) for Coleman's possession of ammunition. I therefore respectfully dissent on this latter issue.</p>\n<p>How the possession of nothing but bullets, absent a gun, facilitates or has the potential to facilitate the offense of possessing marijuana is beyond me. The sentencing transcript indicates that the district court also had difficulty concluding that ammunition alone had the potential to facilitate the marijuana offense. Although it ultimately applied the four-level enhancement, the district court acknowledged that having ammunition without a gun is \"like having ... kindling without the match. You can have the kindling all day long; but if you don't have the match, you can't start the fire.\"</p>\n<p>The majority opinion sets forth two justifications for affirming the district court's determination. First, the majority asserts without explanation that the language of U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(b)(6) is \"plain.\" Maj. Op. at 212 n. 1. The language of that section, however, is anything but plain in my opinion. Section 2K2.1(b)(6) specifies that the four-level enhancement should apply \"[i]f the defendant used or possessed any firearm or ammunition in connection with another felony offense.\" Application Note 14(A) then defines the phrase \"in connection with\" to mean that \"the firearm or ammunition facilitated, or had the potential of facilitating, another felony offense.\" Section 2K2.1(b)(6) thus requires that a court do more than blindly apply the four-level enhancement whenever ammunition is found in close proximity to illegal drugs. Instead, the district court must analyze, on a case-by-case basis, whether the proximity of ammunition alone facilitated or had the potential to facilitate the drug offense. I therefore find that the language of U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(b)(6) is far from plain.</p>\n<p>The majority opinion's second justification for affirming the judgment of the district court boils down to saying that \"the ammunition emboldened Coleman in the knowledge that he was one step closer to having a fully-loaded firearm to protect himself and his illegal drugs, and the ammunition potentially served notice to potential buyers that Coleman was a step closer to having a fully-loaded firearm.\" Maj. Op. at 212. But this \"one step closer\" argument does not withstand scrutiny. The record contains no evidence that Coleman had a gun anywhere around, and bullets alone could hardly embolden him or scare potential buyers who might be inclined to steal his marijuana.</p>\n<p>Many things could in theory put a person \"one step closer\" to having a firearm, such as applying for a firearms permit, having a holster, possessing a laser scope, or earning money to be able to purchase a weapon. But only <i>actual possession of a firearm</i> would potentially \"facilitate\" drug dealing under this court's \"fortress theory,\" because displaying bullets alone can cause no harm. On the other hand, displaying a gun would definitely intimidate someone intending to steal the seller's drugs. And this is true even if the gun is unloaded, because the person staring down the barrel of a gun has no way of knowing whether it is loaded or unloaded. The district court clearly recognized this point: \"If I have a gun that is not loaded and I point my gun at you, you don't know whether my gun is loaded or not. If I have a bullet and I point my bullet at you, you know that I don't have a gun.\" This refutes the majority's contention that Coleman's reasoning leads to the \"absurd result\" that only a loaded gun could result in a four-level enhancement. Maj. Op. at <span class=\"star-pagination\">*217</span> 213. Coleman in fact does not make such an argument.</p>\n<p>Section 2K2.1(b)(6) and Application Note 14(A) do, as the majority repeatedly emphasizes, refer to firearm and ammunition in the disjunctive. But Application Note 14(B), whose relevance the majority fails to acknowledge, links the fortress theory solely to the possession of a firearm. It reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>Application When Other Offense is Burglary or Drug Offense.Subsection[](b)(6)... appl[ies] ... in the case of a drug trafficking offense in which a firearm is found in close proximity to drugs, drug manufacturing materials, or drug paraphernalia. In these cases, application of subsection[](b)(6) ... is warranted because the presence of the firearm has the potential of facilitating another felony offense. ...</blockquote>\n<p>Application Note 14(B)'s limitation to a firearm implies that the fortress theory does <i>not</i> apply to the possession of ammunition. Unlike drug-trafficking cases where a firearm is found in close proximity to the drugs, there is no presumption of facilitation where ammunition alone is found. Rather, under Application Note 14(A), a district court must determine if the ammunition actually facilitated the commission of another felony offense.</p>\n<p>This is not to say that the possession of ammunition alone could never facilitate another felony offense. The four-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(b)(6) could apply to the possession of ammunition alone, for example, where two conspirators plan to rob, say, a bank, with one to bring a gun and the other to bring the ammunition for the gun. In this hypothetical, the one possessing the ammunition could clearly be found to have facilitated the crime of bank robbery, and thus be subject to the four-level enhancement. But that is not the situation in the case before us.</p>\n<p>As the majority notes, \"[t]here is no binding caselaw directly on point.\" Maj. Op. at 212. The only case it can find that supports the enhancement under circumstances similar to those at hand is the unreported Eleventh Circuit case of <i>United States v. Chappell,</i> 334 Fed.Appx. 970 (11th Cir.2009). Maj. Op. at 212, 214. But <i>Chappell</i> is a three-page per curiam opinion that contains no reasoning at all on the issue in question. The total analysis in <i>Chappell</i> on the application of U.S.S.G. § 2K1.1(b)(6) is the following:</p>\n<blockquote>The record also supports the enhancement of Chappell's sentence for possessing ammunition in connection with another felony offense. A defendant is subject to a four-level enhancement if he \"used or possessed any firearm or ammunition in connection with another felony offense.\" U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(b)(6). The enhancement applies \"if the firearm or ammunition facilitated, or had the potential of facilitating, another felony offense.\" <i>Id.</i> cmt. n. 14(A). The district court was entitled to find that the ammunition had the potential to facilitate Chappell's felony possession of methamphetamine. In the absence of a contrary interpretation from this Court or the Supreme Court, the district court did not plainly err by applying the enhancement.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 973 (alterations omitted).</p>\n<p>The present case, therefore, is the first and only published decision in the entire country applying the four-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(b)(6) where the possession of ammunition alone is deemed to facilitate the crime of drug dealing. Because there appears to me no <span class=\"star-pagination\">*218</span> logical support for such a conclusion in this case, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  The Honorable Thomas M. Rose, United States District Judge for the Southern District of Ohio, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(b)(6) applies based upon its plain language. The dissent's interpretation of U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(b)(6) appears to ignore the plain language. The dissent also relies upon an \"implication\" that it finds in Note 14(B). However, the majority finds no such implication in Note 14(B) which applies when a firearm is found, which is not the case here.</p>\n\n</div>",

As a condition for the plea, the United States agreed, subject to certain conditions, to recommend full acceptance of responsibility and to dismiss a possession-of-marijuana count. At sentencing, Coleman was given a four-level enhancement for possessing 23 live rounds of ammunition that facilitated or had the potential to facilitate a felony distribution of marijuana. Coleman was given a two-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, but the United States declined to make a motion for the third-level of reduction for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n<p>Coleman appealed the four-level enhancement for possessing the 23 rounds of live ammunition and the United States' refusal to make a motion for a third-level of reduction for acceptance of responsibility to this Court. For the following reasons, we AFFIRM Coleman's sentence.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>The facts underlying the relevant criminal conduct in this case are not in dispute and are reflected in the Presentence Report (the \"PSR\"). On January 4, 2008, at approximately 9:50 p.m., Memphis Police Department Officers (the \"Officers\") responded to a 911 hang-up call at 4599 Scott Crossing, Apt. # 4, a residence located in Memphis, Tennessee. After arriving at the residence and knocking on the door several times, the Officers encountered Amanda Hensley (\"Hensley\") and her boyfriend Coleman, the Defendant-Appellant.</p>\n<p>Hensley reported to the Officers that she had attempted to call 911 because Coleman had assaulted her and had refused to let her leave. She also said that, after a fight the previous evening, she had ended her relationship with Coleman and left the residence. She returned at approximately 2:00 a.m. the next morning.</p>\n<p>When she returned early on January 4, 2008, Hensley said she encountered Coleman, who was waiting for her in the dark. Coleman prevented her from leaving the residence by, among other things, barricading the doors with furniture and confiscating her cellular phone and car keys. Hensley also said that Coleman had written derogatory words about her on the walls of the residence and that Coleman had physically assaulted her by pushing her and pulling her hair.</p>\n<p>After speaking with Hensley at the door, the Officers entered the apartment and observed that it was in disarray. The Officers also observed, in plain view, a mirror with marijuana residue on it, several individual plastic baggies of marijuana and one live round of .380 caliber ammunition. Based upon these observations, Coleman was taken into custody and removed from the apartment.</p>\n<p>After Coleman was taken into custody, Hensley signed a consent-to-search form. Upon searching the residence, the Officers recovered a large paper bag filled with marijuana and a box of .380 caliber ammunition with 22 live rounds from a drawer containing Coleman's underwear and socks. The Officers also recovered two digital scales covered with marijuana residue from the kitchen and $1,820 in cash from Coleman's person. Overall, the Officers recovered 23 live rounds of .380 caliber ammunition and 71.7 grams of marijuana from the apartment. Based on this recovery, Coleman was formally arrested.</p>\n<p>Following Coleman's arrest, Hensley gave a written statement that Coleman had threatened and assaulted her in the past and that she had seen Coleman sell drugs and pills. Coleman also gave a written statement in which he denied possessing the ammunition or selling the marijuana recovered.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*209</span> On April 15, 2008, Coleman was indicted by a grand jury that charged him with two counts of being a felon in possession of ammunition in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g) and one count of possession with intent to distribute marijuana in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1). On September 10, 2008, a change-of-plea hearing was held during which Coleman pled guilty to the two counts for possession of ammunition. As a condition of the plea, the United States agreed, subject to certain conditions, to recommend full acceptance of responsibility and to dismiss count three for possession of marijuana with the intent to distribute.</p>\n<p>In Coleman's Plea Agreement, the United States agreed to recommend full acceptance of responsibility credit pursuant to U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual (\"U.S.S.G.\") § 3E1.1 (2003) with the following caveat:</p>\n<blockquote>The Defendant understands that if the United States receives information between the signing of this agreement and the time of the sentencing that the Defendant has previously engaged in, or if he engages in the future, in conduct inconsistent with the acceptance of responsibility, including, but not limited to, participation of any additional criminal activities between now and the time of sentencing, this position could change.</blockquote>\n<p>Prior to sentencing, a PSR was prepared in which Coleman was initially assigned a base offense level of 24 and a criminal history category of IV. Coleman's base offense level was then increased four levels to 28 for possession of any firearm or ammunition in connection with another felony offense. The base offense level was then reduced by three for acceptance of responsibility. Coleman's offense level pursuant to the PSR, then became 25. Based upon a total offense level of 25 and a criminal history category of IV, the PSR recommended that Coleman was in an applicable guideline range of 84 to 105 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p>On November 26, 2008, the United States indicated that it had no objections either to the facts or calculations in the PSR. On December 22, 2008, Coleman objected to the four-level enhancement for possession of ammunition in connection with another felony offense. On December 24, 2008, an Addendum to the PSR concluded that a four-level enhancement was appropriate.</p>\n<p>On December 30, 2008, a sentencing hearing was held. During this hearing, Hensley and Kimberly Houston (\"Houston\") one of the Officers, testified. When making contact with Hensley the day prior to the sentencing hearing, the United States learned, for the first time, that Coleman, prior to entering his guilty plea on September 10, 2008, had contacted Hensley multiple times using phones at the federal detention facility. Hensley told the United States that, during one of those phone conversations, Coleman had stated, \"you got me fked up\" and \"you are not going to be happy out there and I'm in here fked up.\" The United States then filed an amended position paper on the PSR requesting that Coleman's offense level be enhanced three-levels for obstruction of justice.</p>\n<p>At the sentencing hearing, the court determined that under the plain language of U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(b)(6) (2007) and Application Note 14(a), the 23 live rounds of ammunition facilitated or had the potential of facilitating a felony distribution of marijuana by Coleman. A four-level enhancement was given by the court.</p>\n<p>The court then turned to the three-level enhancement for obstruction of justice proposed by the United States. The United States offered Hensley's testimony that described her relationship with Coleman <span class=\"star-pagination\">*210</span> and described various threats that Coleman had made to her. Hensley also provided details about the phone calls that she received from Coleman while he was incarcerated. She testified that she had been willingly conversing with Coleman for several months but that, when she refused to provide him with names and addresses of other criminals, he became angry and threatened her. Hensley also testified that, when making the calls, Coleman would instruct her not to use his name and would use another inmate's cell phone code or use three-way phone calls to avoid detection on the recordings. Hensley further testified that, after talking with Coleman, she believed that he was threatening her, which led her to change her phone number. She also said that she did not want to testify at the sentencing hearing because Coleman \"might talk to somebody that would want to do something\" to her and her daughter.</p>\n<p>The United States then called Officer Houston who testified that she had responded to several domestic violence calls at Hensley's residence before the 911 call and that, after Coleman was taken into custody on January 4, 2008, Coleman instructed Hensley not to talk and threatened to kill her. Houston also testified that, when she spoke to Hensley immediately prior to the sentencing hearing, Hensley had said that \"she was scared about testifying because the [D]efendant, Mr. Coleman, had called her making threats and was threatening her life.\" Houston described Hensley as \"nervous and scared.\"</p>\n<p>The United States then argued that Coleman's threats were an attempt to scare her into not testifying at any future hearing or trial. The United States further argued that Coleman's attempts to avoid detection on the detention-facility phones should also be considered. The court, however, rejected these arguments and determined that Coleman's conduct did not rise to the level of obstruction of justice.</p>\n<p>The United States declined to make a motion for the third-level of acceptance of responsibility based upon the testimony of Hensley and Houston and a reading of the portion of the plea agreement addressing acceptance of responsibility. The court then awarded Coleman a two-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, which resulted in a total offense level of 26 and a criminal history category of IV. Accordingly, Coleman was assigned a new applicable guideline range of 92 to 115 months.</p>\n<p>Coleman was sentenced to 92 months of imprisonment and three years of supervised release on the two counts of possession of ammunition. As a condition of the plea, the United States dismissed count three of the indictment for possession of marijuana.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.

Whether the facts found warrant the application of a particular guideline provision is a legal question reviewed de novo. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>When a defendant objects or raises an issue before the district court, the issue is reviewed on appeal for an abuse of discretion. <i>United States v.

When reviewing for an abuse of discretion, the appeals court gives deference to the district court's decision. <i>Hardyman v.

To reverse for plain error, a reviewing court must conduct four distinct analyses: (1) determine whether an error occurred in the district court; (2) if an error occurred, determine whether it was plain; (3) determine whether the plain error affected a substantial right; and (4) if all three exist, decide whether the plain error affected the fairness, integrity or public reputation of the judicial proceeding. <i>United States v.

Finally, a plain error is one that is clear or obvious under current law, and an error that affects a substantial right is an error that affected the outcome of the district court proceedings. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV. DISCUSSION</h2>\n<p>Coleman raises two challenges to his sentence. We address each in turn.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Sentence Enhancement</h2>\n<p>Coleman first argues that his possession of ammunition alone did not have the potential for facilitating his concomitant drug possession felony because simply possessing a bullet without a gun does not aid in the commission of drug possession. Thus, according to Coleman, his sentence should not have been enhanced pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(b)(6).</p>\n<p>The government has the burden of proof to show a factual predicate for this sentencing enhancement by a preponderance of the evidence. <i>United States v. Ennenga,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"774722\"><a href=\"/opinion/774722/united-states-v-ronald-alan-ennenga/\"><span class=\"volume\">263</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">499</span></a></span>, 503 (6th Cir.2001). The relevant facts on this issue have been shown by the United States and are not in dispute. Coleman was in possession of 23 live rounds of .380 caliber ammunition and was in possession of illegal drugs for the purpose of distribution. Further, the ammunition was found in close proximity to the drugs. The issue to be decided is whether or not ammunition standing alone can have the potential to facilitate the felony distribution of drugs.</p>\n<p>The relevant Sentencing Guideline relates to increases to the base offense level for unlawful receipt, possession or transportation of firearms or ammunition and provides that, \"[i]f the defendant used or possessed any firearm or ammunition in connection with another felony offense ..., increase by 4 levels.\" U.S.S.G. § 2k2.1(b)(6). (Emphasis added.) Application Note 14(A) to this Sentencing Guideline clarifies the meaning of \"in connection with\" by providing that subsection <span class=\"star-pagination\">*212</span> (b)(6) applies in general \"if the firearm or ammunition facilitated or had the potential of facilitating another felony offense or another offense, respectively.\" (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p>Thus, applying U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(b)(6) and Note 14(A) thereto, Coleman should receive a four-level enhancement if he possessed any firearm or ammunition in connection with the drug trafficking.<sup>[1]</sup> Coleman does not dispute the drug-trafficking charge or that the ammunition was found in proximity to illegal drugs and drug paraphernalia. He does, however, dispute that the ammunition, alone, could have been used to facilitate a drug transaction.</p>\n<p>A Judge of this Court has, referring to Webster's Third New International Dictionary, defined \"facilitate\" for purposes of U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(b)(6) as to make easier or less difficult. <i>Richardson,</i> 510 F.3d at 629 (McKeague concurring). Thus, for U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(b)(6) to apply, Coleman's possession of the ammunition in close proximity to the drugs must make drug trafficking easier or less difficult or have the potential to make drug trafficking easier or less difficult.</p>\n<p>There is no binding caselaw directly on point. However the Eleventh Circuit has upheld a district court that applied U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(b)(6) where only ammunition was found. <i>See United States v. Chappell,</i> 334 Fed.Appx. 970, 973 (11th Cir.2009) (unpublished) (holding that a district court is entitled to find that ammunition alone had the potential to facilitate felony possession of methamphetamine).</p>\n<p>U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(b)(6) is most often at issue in cases in which a defendant is found to possess a firearm and ammunition. When determining whether a defendant's possession of a firearm is \"in connection with\" drug trafficking, this Court has adopted the \"fortress theory.\" <i>Richardson,</i> 510 F.3d at 626. The \"fortress theory\" provides \"that a connection is established if it reasonably appears that the firearms found on the premises controlled or owned by a defendant and in [the defendant's] actual or constructive possession, are to be used to protect the drugs or otherwise facilitate a drug transaction.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Ennenga,</i> 263 F.3d at 503 (6th Cir.2001)). Further, U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(b)(6) \"applies if the firearm had some emboldening role in [a] defendant's felonious conduct.\" <i>United States v. Angel,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1188819\"><a href=\"/opinion/1188819/united-states-v-angel/\"><span class=\"volume\">576</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">318</span></a></span>, 321 (6th Cir.2009)(quoting <i>Ennenga,</i> 263 F.3d at 503) (internal quotation marks omitted; alteration in original).</p>\n<p>Applying the \"fortress theory\" reasoning, Coleman's possession of ammunition alone facilitated or had the potential to facilitate felony drug trafficking. Coleman's possession of the ammunition reduced or had the potential to reduce the difficulty of completing the felony drug trafficking. Not only was the ammunition easily accessible and stored in close proximity to the illegal drugs, but the ammunition emboldened Coleman in the knowledge that he was one step closer to having a fully-loaded firearm to protect himself and his illegal drugs, and the ammunition potentially served notice to potential buyers that Coleman was a step closer to having a fully-loaded firearm.</p>\n<p>In addition to applying this Court's \"fortress theory,\" a plain reading of U.S.S.G. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*213</span> § 2K2.1(b)(6) and Application Note 14(A) supports a four-level enhancement for Coleman. Both U.S.S.G. § 2k2.1(b)(6) and Application Note 14(A) refer to firearms and ammunition using the disjunctive \"or.\" If U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1 required that a firearm always be present in order for ammunition to facilitate, this section would use \"and\" between the terms firearm and ammunition or would only require that a firearm be present.</p>\n<p>Coleman offers several arguments on this issue. First, he argues that there is no clear definition within the Guidelines of the meaning of \"facilitated, or had the potential of facilitating.\" This is accurate. However, the Court has referred to Webster's dictionary here as it has in many other cases for a definition of \"facilitate.\"</p>\n<p>Coleman next argues that the underlying justification for the \"fortress theory\" is less compelling when confronted with a defendant who was only in possession of ammunition because it is unclear how ammunition alone can create a heightened possibility of danger during drug transactions. However, without the ammunition, an alleged drug dealer would have to take a step that otherwise would not have to be taken  obtaining ammunition for a gun. Thus, having the ammunition facilitates or makes easier the use of a firearm in a felony drug transaction.</p>\n<p>Coleman next argues that the Guideline provision at issue here is a sentencing enhancement that was created in response to a concern about the increased risk of violence when firearms are used or possessed during the commission of a felony. <i>See e.g. </i><i>United States v. Hurst,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770650\"><a href=\"/opinion/770650/united-states-v-scottie-ray-hurst/\"><span class=\"volume\">228</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">751</span></a></span>, 753 (6th Cir.2000). The presence of ammunition increases the risk of violence because it puts the owner of the ammunition one step closer to having a loaded firearm. Thus, the Guideline is clear that an enhancement is in order for the presence of a weapon or ammunition. The Guideline does not require the presence of a weapon and ammunition.</p>\n<p>Coleman next argues that violence was not more likely to occur in the present situation because ammunition without a firearm is merely a static object that can do little or no harm to anyone. First, the Guideline does not talk about whether or not violence is more likely to occur, and its purpose is to address a concern about the increased risk of violence. The Sentencing Guideline addresses the presence of a weapon or ammunition. Also, applying Coleman's reasoning, an unloaded weapon would be a static object so only a loaded weapon could result in a four-level enhancement which is an absurd result and not the result intended by the Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n<p>Coleman's next argument is that the district court's application of the \"emboldening\" test is unpersuasive and an inappropriate \"theoretical leap\" because the district court's conclusion of exactly how the possession of ammunition alone would facilitate or embolden him was based upon pure speculation as to what might have happened in the future. However, the district court's reasoning was based upon present and unchallenged facts as required by the applicable Guideline. The speculation, if there was any, was but a mere example of why the applicable Guideline says weapon <i>or</i> ammunition instead of weapon and ammunition.</p>\n<p>Coleman's final argument is that ammunition alone has no potential for making any other felony easier or less difficult to complete because, without a firearm, ammunition can do nothing. Without accepting Coleman's premise that ammunition can do nothing without a firearm, this Court has already determined above that ammunition can facilitate the commission of a felony.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*214</span> In conclusion, based upon an application of the \"fortress theory\" and a plain reading of U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(b)(6) and Application Note 14(A), the four-level enhancement given to Coleman was legally correct. Further, the Eleventh Circuit has already upheld a district court's application of the four-level enhancement where only ammunition was found. Finally, the district judge's fact-finding in this matter has not been shown to be clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Sentence Reduction</h2>\n<p>Coleman's second issue presented for review is that the district court erred in denying him the third level of a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1(b) because the government's justification for refusing to make the motion was arbitrary and unrelated to the timing of his Plea. Coleman did not raise this issue below. Thus, the district court's decision on this issue is reviewed for plain error. <i>Morrow,</i> 977 F.2d at 226.</p>\n<p>U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1(b) provides that, upon motion by the government stating that the defendant has assisted authorities in the investigation or prosecution of his own misconduct by timely notifying authorities of his intention to enter a guilty plea, thereby permitting the government to avoid preparing for trial, and if the defendant qualifies for a decrease due to acceptance of responsibility and the offense level is 16 or greater, the offense level will be decreased by 1. Further, Application Note 6 to § 3E1.1 provides, in relevant part, that the one-level reduction may be granted only upon a formal motion by the government at the time of sentencing.</p>\n<p>The Sixth Circuit has interpreted § 3E1.1, along with Application Note 6, to mean that the government's discretion to file the motion is limited only by an unconstitutionally impermissible motive or if it is arbitrary. <i>United States v. Lapsins,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1197012\"><a href=\"/opinion/1197012/united-states-v-lapsins/\"><span class=\"volume\">570</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">758</span></a></span>, 770 (6th Cir.2009). In <i>Lapsins,</i> the defendant sought a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to § 3E1.1. The district court granted a two-level reduction, the government did not move for an additional one-level reduction, and <i>Lapsins</i> appealed. On appeal, <i>Lapsins</i> argued that he was entitled to the third-level reduction because he had accepted responsibility and his decision to plead guilty permitted the government to avoid preparing for a trial. <i>Id.</i> at 768. This Court found that \"the government may decline to move for a reduction under § 3E1.1(b) so long as the decision does not rest on a constitutionally impermissible factor and is not arbitrary.\" <i>Id.</i> at 770. This Court then went on to conclude that the government believed in good faith that <i>Lapsins</i> had not accepted responsibility. <i>Id.</i> at 771. As a result, the government's decision not to move for the reduction was not arbitrary and was thus permissible. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>In <i>Lapsins,</i> the government objected to any reduction for acceptance of responsibility, but the district court granted a two-level reduction based upon the defendant's statement of facts and guilty plea. However, the district court did not award the third level because the government did not move for the third level. The district court's decision was upheld by this Court.</p>\n<p>In this case, Coleman's offense level was 16 or more and the Court found that he was entitled to a two-level reduction. The United States argued for no reduction because Coleman had obstructed justice. The district granted the two-level reduction because it determined that Coleman had not obstructed justice and had pled guilty prior to trial.</p>\n<p>The United States then declined to move for the third-level reduction based upon the information that it had first received <span class=\"star-pagination\">*215</span> the day prior to the sentencing hearing from Hensley that Coleman had threatened her on the telephone in July of 2008. The decision not to move for a third-level reduction, according to the United States, was based upon its \"genuine and good faith belief\" that Coleman's threatening telephone call to Hensley in July of 2008 was inconsistent with acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n<p>Coleman first argues that, because the conduct cited by the United States did not amount to obstruction of justice, its justification for refusing to move for the third level reduction was arbitrary. However, the reason given by the United States was not that Coleman's conduct was an obstruction of justice, although the United States argued unsuccessfully that it was. The reason given by the United States was that Coleman's actions indicated that he had not accepted responsibility. This justification was based upon a reasonable belief and was thus not arbitrary.</p>\n<p>Coleman next argues, based upon this Court's ruling in <i>United States v. Robertson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"774408\"><a href=\"/opinion/774408/united-states-v-james-g-robertson/\"><span class=\"volume\">260</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">500</span></a></span> (6th Cir.2001), that the government is required to move for the third-level reduction so long as he can demonstrate that the offense level determined prior to consideration of acceptance of responsibility was 16 or greater and he timely notified the government of his intent to plead guilty. However, as this Court has later explained, the government may refuse to move for the third-level reduction so long as the government's reason for refusal is not based upon a constitutionally impermissible factor and is not arbitrary.</p>\n<p>Coleman next argues that, where the government's justification for refusal to move for the third-level reduction is wholly unrelated to the timing of his plea as compared to preparation for trial, a court should show no deference to the government's contention that he did not fully accept responsibility unless the government objected to him receiving a reduction under § 3E1.1(a). This argument, too, is without merit. The court may show deference to the government's reasons for not seeking a third-level reduction even if the reasons have nothing to do with the timing between the plea and trial, so long as the refusal is not based upon a constitutionally impermissible factor and is not arbitrary.</p>\n<p>Given that there was evidence presented that Coleman threatened Hensley and that Hensley was scared to testify at the sentencing hearing because of what Coleman might do to her, the United States had reason to believe in good faith that Coleman had not accepted responsibility. Applying this Court's reasoning in <i>Lapsins</i> to the present matter, the United States was not required to move for the third level reduction because its reason for not doing so was not arbitrary. The United States, in good faith, had reason to believe that Coleman had not accepted responsibility. Thus, there was no error by the district court, let alone a \"plain error.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>V. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The trial court did not err in applying a four-level enhancement for possession of ammunition. The trial court also did not err in failing to grant the third-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility. For these reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p>GILMAN, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p>I agree that the district court did not err in failing to grant Coleman the third-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1(b). The reasoning in Judge Rose's opinion on this issue strikes me as sound, and I therefore concur. On the other hand, I disagree with <span class=\"star-pagination\">*216</span> the majority's justification for applying the four-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(b)(6) for Coleman's possession of ammunition. I therefore respectfully dissent on this latter issue.</p>\n<p>How the possession of nothing but bullets, absent a gun, facilitates or has the potential to facilitate the offense of possessing marijuana is beyond me. The sentencing transcript indicates that the district court also had difficulty concluding that ammunition alone had the potential to facilitate the marijuana offense. Although it ultimately applied the four-level enhancement, the district court acknowledged that having ammunition without a gun is \"like having ... kindling without the match. You can have the kindling all day long; but if you don't have the match, you can't start the fire.\"</p>\n<p>The majority opinion sets forth two justifications for affirming the district court's determination. First, the majority asserts without explanation that the language of U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(b)(6) is \"plain.\" Maj. Op. at 212 n. 1. The language of that section, however, is anything but plain in my opinion. Section 2K2.1(b)(6) specifies that the four-level enhancement should apply \"[i]f the defendant used or possessed any firearm or ammunition in connection with another felony offense.\" Application Note 14(A) then defines the phrase \"in connection with\" to mean that \"the firearm or ammunition facilitated, or had the potential of facilitating, another felony offense.\" Section 2K2.1(b)(6) thus requires that a court do more than blindly apply the four-level enhancement whenever ammunition is found in close proximity to illegal drugs. Instead, the district court must analyze, on a case-by-case basis, whether the proximity of ammunition alone facilitated or had the potential to facilitate the drug offense. I therefore find that the language of U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(b)(6) is far from plain.</p>\n<p>The majority opinion's second justification for affirming the judgment of the district court boils down to saying that \"the ammunition emboldened Coleman in the knowledge that he was one step closer to having a fully-loaded firearm to protect himself and his illegal drugs, and the ammunition potentially served notice to potential buyers that Coleman was a step closer to having a fully-loaded firearm.\" Maj. Op. at 212. But this \"one step closer\" argument does not withstand scrutiny. The record contains no evidence that Coleman had a gun anywhere around, and bullets alone could hardly embolden him or scare potential buyers who might be inclined to steal his marijuana.</p>\n<p>Many things could in theory put a person \"one step closer\" to having a firearm, such as applying for a firearms permit, having a holster, possessing a laser scope, or earning money to be able to purchase a weapon. But only <i>actual possession of a firearm</i> would potentially \"facilitate\" drug dealing under this court's \"fortress theory,\" because displaying bullets alone can cause no harm. On the other hand, displaying a gun would definitely intimidate someone intending to steal the seller's drugs. And this is true even if the gun is unloaded, because the person staring down the barrel of a gun has no way of knowing whether it is loaded or unloaded. The district court clearly recognized this point: \"If I have a gun that is not loaded and I point my gun at you, you don't know whether my gun is loaded or not. If I have a bullet and I point my bullet at you, you know that I don't have a gun.\" This refutes the majority's contention that Coleman's reasoning leads to the \"absurd result\" that only a loaded gun could result in a four-level enhancement. Maj. Op. at <span class=\"star-pagination\">*217</span> 213. Coleman in fact does not make such an argument.</p>\n<p>Section 2K2.1(b)(6) and Application Note 14(A) do, as the majority repeatedly emphasizes, refer to firearm and ammunition in the disjunctive. But Application Note 14(B), whose relevance the majority fails to acknowledge, links the fortress theory solely to the possession of a firearm. It reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>Application When Other Offense is Burglary or Drug Offense.Subsection[](b)(6)... appl[ies] ... in the case of a drug trafficking offense in which a firearm is found in close proximity to drugs, drug manufacturing materials, or drug paraphernalia. In these cases, application of subsection[](b)(6) ... is warranted because the presence of the firearm has the potential of facilitating another felony offense. ...</blockquote>\n<p>Application Note 14(B)'s limitation to a firearm implies that the fortress theory does <i>not</i> apply to the possession of ammunition. Unlike drug-trafficking cases where a firearm is found in close proximity to the drugs, there is no presumption of facilitation where ammunition alone is found. Rather, under Application Note 14(A), a district court must determine if the ammunition actually facilitated the commission of another felony offense.</p>\n<p>This is not to say that the possession of ammunition alone could never facilitate another felony offense. The four-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(b)(6) could apply to the possession of ammunition alone, for example, where two conspirators plan to rob, say, a bank, with one to bring a gun and the other to bring the ammunition for the gun. In this hypothetical, the one possessing the ammunition could clearly be found to have facilitated the crime of bank robbery, and thus be subject to the four-level enhancement. But that is not the situation in the case before us.</p>\n<p>As the majority notes, \"[t]here is no binding caselaw directly on point.\" Maj. Op. at 212. The only case it can find that supports the enhancement under circumstances similar to those at hand is the unreported Eleventh Circuit case of <i>United States v. Chappell,</i> 334 Fed.Appx. 970 (11th Cir.2009). Maj. Op. at 212, 214. But <i>Chappell</i> is a three-page per curiam opinion that contains no reasoning at all on the issue in question. The total analysis in <i>Chappell</i> on the application of U.S.S.G. § 2K1.1(b)(6) is the following:</p>\n<blockquote>The record also supports the enhancement of Chappell's sentence for possessing ammunition in connection with another felony offense. A defendant is subject to a four-level enhancement if he \"used or possessed any firearm or ammunition in connection with another felony offense.\" U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(b)(6). The enhancement applies \"if the firearm or ammunition facilitated, or had the potential of facilitating, another felony offense.\" <i>Id.</i> cmt. n. 14(A). The district court was entitled to find that the ammunition had the potential to facilitate Chappell's felony possession of methamphetamine. In the absence of a contrary interpretation from this Court or the Supreme Court, the district court did not plainly err by applying the enhancement.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 973 (alterations omitted).</p>\n<p>The present case, therefore, is the first and only published decision in the entire country applying the four-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(b)(6) where the possession of ammunition alone is deemed to facilitate the crime of drug dealing. Because there appears to me no <span class=\"star-pagination\">*218</span> logical support for such a conclusion in this case, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  The Honorable Thomas M. Rose, United States District Judge for the Southern District of Ohio, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(b)(6) applies based upon its plain language. The dissent's interpretation of U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(b)(6) appears to ignore the plain language. The dissent also relies upon an \"implication\" that it finds in Note 14(B). However, the majority finds no such implication in Note 14(B) which applies when a firearm is found, which is not the case here.</p>\n\n</div>",
