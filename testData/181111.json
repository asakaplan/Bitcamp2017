From December 10, 2007, through December 14,\n2007, Moto Diesel Mexicana, S.A. de C.V. (“MDM”) issued eight checks totaling\n$2 million to Casa de Cambio Majapara S.A. de C.V. (“Majapara”). The checks were\n\n\n         *\n           The Honorable Edmund A. Sargus, Jr., United States District Judge for the Southern District of\nOhio, sitting by designation.\n\n\n                                                   1\n\fNo. 09-1704            Zions First Nat’l Bank v. Moto Diesel Mexicana                               Page 2\n\n\ndrawn on MDM’s account at Comerica Bank in Detroit, Michigan. On December 14\nand 18, 2007, Majapara attempted to deposit all the funds from the eight checks into its\naccount at Zions First National Bank in Salt Lake City, Utah (“Zions”). In turn,\nMajapora withdrew the $2 million from its account at Zions. Thereafter, however,\nComerica Bank notified Zions that the checks from MDM had been dishonored because\nof insufficient funds. Ultimately, Zions suffered a loss of $2 million.\n\n         Zions brought suit against MDM alleging (1) holder in due course status;\n(2) conversion; and (3) quantum valebant. In response to the Complaint, MDM filed\nthree motions to dismiss, under F. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(2), (5) and (6). Several months later,\nbefore disposition of the pending motions, MDM filed a motion to dismiss on the\ngrounds of forum non conveniens. On April 1, 2009, the district court granted the\nmotion to dismiss on the grounds of forum non conveniens and denied as moot the other\npending motions.\n\n         Zions thereafter filed a motion for reconsideration, which the district court\ndenied. A timely appeal followed. On appeal, Zions argues that the district court erred\nin dismissing its claims on forum non conveniens grounds. For the reasons that follow,\nwe VACATE the decision of the district court and REMAND for further proceedings\nconsistent with this Opinion.\n\nI.       STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n         We review for clear abuse of discretion a district court’s determination that the\ndoctrine of forum non conveniens requires dismissal of a case. Duha v. Agrium, Inc.,\n448 F.3d 867, 873 (6th Cir. 2006).1 A dismissal upon the grounds of forum non\nconveniens is justified when a defendant establishes that an adequate alternative forum\nis available and that the public and private factors enumerated in Gulf Oil Corp. v.\n\n\n         1\n           As explained by the Supreme Court, the doctrine is “a supervening venue provision, permitting\ndisplacement of the ordinary rules of venue when, in light of certain conditions, the trial court thinks that\njurisdiction ought to be declined.” Am. Dredging Co. v. Miller, 510 U.S. 443, 453 (1994). Following\nenactment of 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a) in 1962, the doctrine of forum non conveniens now applies only in cases\nin which the alternative forum is in another country. If another federal district is an alternative forum,\ndismissal on grounds of forum non conveniens is inapplicable and § 1404(a) applies. Sinochem Int’l Co.\nv Malay. Int’l Shipping Corp., 549 U.S. 422, 430 (2007).\n\fNo. 09-1704          Zions First Nat’l Bank v. Moto Diesel Mexicana                      Page 3\n\n\nGilbert, 330 U.S. 501, 508-09 (1947), demonstrate that the chosen forum is\nunnecessarily burdensome to a defendant or a district court. Id. The relevant public and\nprivate factors in a forum non conveniens challenge, as set forth in Gulf Oil, include\naccess to witnesses and evidence, availability of compulsory process, cost of obtaining\nwitnesses, administration difficulties for the trial court, local interest in the litigation, and\nthe law applicable to the controversy. Gulf Oil, 330 U.S. at 508-09. These factors are\nto be considered for each analytically distinct claim brought by a plaintiff. Duha, 448\nF.3d at 879. “[W]here the court has considered all relevant public and private interest\nfactors, and where its balancing of these factors is reasonable, its decision deserves\nsubstantial deference.” Piper Aircraft Co. v. Reyno, 454 U.S. 235, 257 (1981).\n\n        In determining whether a case should be dismissed on the grounds of forum non\nconveniens, a district court must apply a strong presumption in favor of a plaintiff’s\nselected forum, particularly if the forum is the home of the plaintiff, because “it is\nreasonable to assume that this choice is convenient.” Id. at 255-56. When the plaintiff’s\nchoice of forum, however, is not the home of the plaintiff, the normally applicable\nassumption that the forum choice is convenient carries significantly less weight. Id. at\n255-56. Nevertheless, “[t]his lesser standard of deference should presumptively not\napply to a U.S. plaintiff’s choice of forum.” Duha, 448 F.3d at 874. Instead, “[i]n\ngeneral, the standard of deference for a U.S. plaintiff’s choice of a home forum permits\ndismissal only when the defendant ‘establish[es] such oppressiveness and vexation to\na defendant as to be out of all proportion to a plaintiff’s convenience, which may be\nshown to be slight or nonexistent.’” Id. 873-74 (quoting Koster v. Am. Lumbermens\nMut. Cas. Co., 330 U.S. 518, 524 (1947) (alteration in original)).\n\nII.     DISCUSSION\n\n        In this action, the district court applied the doctrine of forum non conveniens to\ndismiss all three counts of Zions’ complaint based upon a conclusion that the case was\nnot a “local controversy.” Zions First Nat’l Bank v. Moto Diesel Mexicana, S.A., No.\n08-10528, 2009 WL 910764, at *3 (E.D. Mich. Apr. 1, 2009) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). The district court noted that none of the parties involved in the dispute is\n\fNo. 09-1704         Zions First Nat’l Bank v. Moto Diesel Mexicana                      Page 4\n\n\nlocated in Michigan, the forum, and that “[t]he only connection to Michigan is that\nMDM bounced checks drawn on an account here.” Id.\n\n        In determining that the case should be dismissed on the grounds of forum non\nconveniens, the district court focused upon two considerations: first, whether an\nadequate alternative forum exists for adjudicating the dispute; and second, whether\npublic and private interests can be best satisfied by a transfer of the case to an alternative\nforum. As to the first factor, the district court determined that the courts of Mexico\nprovided an adequate forum. As to the second factor, the district court considered the\nlocation of witnesses and evidence. The court found that all of the witnesses for MDM\nand Majapara resided in Mexico, while Zions’ witnesses were in Utah. The court also\nnoted that, although the bank records were located in Michigan, they could be easily\ntransferred to Mexico. The district court, however, did not discuss whether the choice\nof forum was oppressive or vexatious, nor did the district court conduct a separate\nanalysis of the relevant pubic and private factors for each distinct set of claims asserted\nby Zions. We conclude that these omissions require remand.\n\n        Our review of this action is guided by Duha, 448 F.3d 867. In Duha, this Court\nreversed the decision of a district court which had dismissed all claims on the basis of\nforum non conveniens. The district court, in a manner similar to this case, analyzed two\nissues regarding an alternative forum. First, the district court found that Argentina, the\nforeign forum in that case, provided a reasonable and available alternative forum. Id.\nat 872. Second, the court determined that, while witnesses were scattered among various\ncountries, Argentina provided the most convenient forum. Id.\n\n        On appeal, this Court recognized that the decision of the district court was\nentitled to deference under a clear abuse of discretion review. Id. at 873. Nonetheless,\nthis Court found that the district court erred for three reasons:\n\n        First, the district court did not apply the deference required for a forum\n        choice made by a U.S. plaintiff under Koster v. American Lumbermens\n        Mutual Casualty Co., 330 U.S. 518, 524, 67 S.Ct. 828, 91 L.Ed. 1067\n        (1947). Second, the district court erred in its weighing of the relative ease\n        of access to documents and live testimony. Third, the district court, in\n\fNo. 09-1704         Zions First Nat’l Bank v. Moto Diesel Mexicana                   Page 5\n\n\n        balancing the convenience of the alternative forums, disregarded a\n        substantial portion of plaintiff’s claims.\n\nId. All of these reasons are implicated in the case before us. We address each one in\nturn.\n\n        A.      Deference to Plaintiff’s Forum Selection\n\n        The district court failed to accord the appropriate degree of deference to Zions’\nselection of Michigan as the forum for prosecuting this action. Indeed, the district\ncourt’s ruling does not mention, and does not appear to have considered, the deference\nthat a plaintiff’s choice of forum is normally accorded, or the fact that it was Zions, a\nU.S. plaintiff, that made the forum selection. In this appeal, MDM contends that the\ndeference normally given to a plaintiff’s choice of a forum does not apply when the\nforum is not the “home” of the plaintiff. See Piper Aircraft, 454 U.S. at 255-56 (noting\nthat a foreign plaintiff’s choice of forum does not carry the same assumption that its\nchoice of forum is convenient as does the choice of a plaintiff bringing suit in its home\nforum). Zions, a Utah corporation, brought this case in Michigan, where it is not a\nresident. Unlike the Scottish plaintiff in Piper Aircraft, however, Zions is not a foreign\nplaintiff. It is a corporation with its principal place of business in Salt Lake City, Utah,\nand therefore a U.S. plaintiff. Thus, the lesser standard of deference to a plaintiff’s\nchoice of forum does not apply.\n\n        Moreover, Zions has brought this action in the district in which the claims\nallegedly arose. If the claim by MDM is that Utah is a more convenient forum, then\nsuch matter is addressed under 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a). If the claim is that the case is better\nsuited for disposition in Mexico, then the doctrine of forum non conveniens provides the\nanalysis, which includes the strong presumption in favor of the plaintiff’s forum\nselection.\n\n        Although we note that a district court need not make an explicit finding that\nproceeding with the suit in the United States would be oppressive or vexatious to a\ndefendant, Kryvicky v. Scandinavian Airlines Sys., 807 F.2d 514, 517 (6th Cir. 1986),\n\fNo. 09-1704         Zions First Nat’l Bank v. Moto Diesel Mexicana                     Page 6\n\n\nthe forum non conveniens determination must indicate that the district court considered\nwhether any oppression and vexation to a defendant was “out of all proportion to\nplaintiff’s convenience.” Koster, 330 U.S. at 524. Here, the district court’s opinion does\nnot indicate that it undertook the requisite analysis. Accordingly, the district court erred\nin failing to accord Zions the strong presumption in favor of its selection of the Eastern\nDistrict of Michigan as the forum for this case.\n\n        B.      Relative Ease of Access to Documents and Witnesses\n\n        The district court’s failure to recognize the strong presumption in favor of Zions’\nchoice of Michigan as the forum for this action is evident in its analysis of the relevant\nGulf Oil factors. In that respect, the district court erred in according inordinate weight\nto the cost of travel and obtaining witnesses.\n\n        The district court’s discussion of the private Gulf Oil factors consisted of the\nfollowing:\n\n        The private interest factors–access to sources of proof, location of\n        witnesses–weigh in favor of Mexico. All of MDM and Majapara’s\n        witnesses are located there. Zions Bank’s witnesses are in Utah, although\n        they apparently have traveled to Mexico on business before. The parties\n        have not identified any witnesses in Michigan, except perhaps a\n        custodian of the records of Comerica Bank. MDM’s bank records are in\n        Michigan, although it should be a simple matter to transfer those records\n        to Mexico; these records are likely in MDM’s possession already as well.\n        As a practical matter, all parties will need to travel to Michigan for trial\n        if the case remains here, which the court believes will be more\n        logistically difficult and expensive than if the case were tried in Mexico.\n\nZions, 2009 WL 910764, at *3.\n\n        The cost of travel and of obtaining testimony of witnesses is an appropriate\nconsideration in initially determining whether the forum selected by the plaintiff\noppresses the defendant. Here, the district court simply noted the potentially greater\nlogistical difficulty and expense entailed by requiring the parties to travel to Michigan\ninstead of Mexico. Id. Such a conclusion does not establish an oppressive or vexatious\nburden on the defendant, which used a bank in Michigan to conduct the business at issue\n\fNo. 09-1704            Zions First Nat’l Bank v. Moto Diesel Mexicana                              Page 7\n\n\nin this case. The fact that MDM’s witnesses are in Mexico is a consideration, but less\nso given that the gist of this lawsuit is business activity of MDM in Detroit, Michigan.\n\n         With respect to this factor, MDM contends on appeal that Majapara witnesses\nwould resist the giving of testimony in the United States, because the company is\nallegedly under criminal investigation in Mexico. No such finding was made by the\ndistrict court, however, and the affidavit cited by MDM indicates only that one officer\nof the company has been arrested in connection with a criminal investigation, but does\nnot specify whether that officer is actually a witness in this case. (See R. 13 Ex. A. ¶ 5.)\nAs held in Duha, availability of compulsory process, though a consideration, “is less\nweighty when it has not been alleged or shown that any witness would be unwilling to\ntestify.” Duha, 448 F.3d at 877.\n\n         C.       Analysis of the Claims\n\n         Finally, in balancing the convenience of the alternative forums, the district court\ndisregarded a substantial portion of plaintiff’s claims. In considering the application of\nthe doctrine of forum non conveniens, a district court must analyze each claim brought,\nparticularly if the causes of action asserted require different types of proof and evidence.\nId. at 879. In this case, Zions’ claim that it is a holder in due course of a negotiable\ninstrument requires different proof and evidence from its claims for conversion and\nquantum valebant.2 Thus, the district court was required to evaluate the ease of access\nto documents and witnesses as that factor pertains to Zions’ holder-in-due-course claim\nseparately from its other claims. The district court’s discussion, set forth above, offers\nno separate analysis of the Gulf Oil factors–in particular the ease of access to witnesses\nand documents–with respect to Zions’ claim that MDM is liable to Zions as a holder in\ndue course of a negotiable instrument. Virtually all of the evidence in support of such\nclaim would necessarily be documentary, most of which would presumably be located\nwhere the transaction occurred, which was Detroit, Michigan. In sum, the district court\n\n\n         2\n          Quantum valebant literally defined as “as much as they were worth,” is a claim requiring proof\nof worth and, at least theoretically, requires more proof than that of a holder in due course. See Webster’s\nLegal Dictionary, 6th ed., p. 1244.\n\fNo. 09-1704            Zions First Nat’l Bank v. Moto Diesel Mexicana                              Page 8\n\n\ndid not conduct a separate evaluation of each of the claims to determine which forum\nwas best suited to resolve the litigation, as it was required to do under Duha.3\n\nIII.     CONCLUSION\n\n         Based upon the foregoing, we conclude that the district court did not state\nadequately its reasons for dismissing Zions’ claims on the grounds of forum non\nconveniens. Accordingly, the decision of the district court is hereby VACATED and the\ncase REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n         3\n           We note that in considering each discrete claim under the Gulf Oil factors, the district court is\nfree to conclude that some claims survive a forum non conveniens challenge, while others do not. See\nBoosey & Hawkes Music Publishers, Ltd. v. Walt Disney Co., 934 F. Supp. 119, 120 (S.D.N.Y. 1996)\n(granting, on grounds of forum non conveniens, defendant’s motion to dismiss only the second cause of\naction asserted in plaintiff’s complaint), vacated in part on other grounds, 145 F.3d 481 (2d Cir. 1998).\n\f",

These factors are to be considered for each analytically distinct claim brought by a plaintiff. <i>Duha,</i> 448 F.3d at 879. \"[W]here the court has considered all relevant public and private interest factors, and where its balancing of these factors is reasonable, its decision deserves substantial deference.\" <i>Piper Aircraft Co. v.

Moto Diesel Mexicana, S.A.,</i> No. 08-10528, 2009 WL 910764, at *3 (E.D.Mich. Apr.1, 2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). The district court noted that none of the parties involved in the dispute is located in Michigan, the forum, and that \"[t]he only connection to Michigan is that MDM bounced checks drawn on an account here.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>In determining that the case should be dismissed on the grounds of <i>forum non conveniens,</i> the district court focused upon two considerations: first, whether an adequate alternative forum exists for adjudicating the dispute; and second, whether public and private interests can be best satisfied by a transfer of the case to an alternative forum. As to the first factor, the district court determined that the courts of Mexico provided an adequate forum. As to the second factor, the district court considered the location of witnesses and evidence. The court found that all of the witnesses for MDM and Majapara resided in Mexico, while Zions' witnesses were in Utah. The court also noted that, although the bank records were located in Michigan, they could be easily transferred to Mexico. The district court, however, did not discuss whether the choice of forum was oppressive or vexatious, nor did the district court conduct a separate analysis of the relevant public and private factors for each distinct set of claims asserted by Zions. We conclude that these omissions require remand.</p>\n<p>Our review of this action is guided by <i>Duha,</i> 448 F.3d 867. In <i>Duha,</i> this Court reversed the decision of a district court which had dismissed all claims on the basis of <i>forum non conveniens.</i> The district court, in a manner similar to this case, analyzed two issues regarding an alternative forum. First, the district court found that Argentina, the foreign forum in that case, provided a reasonable and available alternative forum. <i>Id.</i> at 872. Second, the court determined that, while witnesses were scattered among various countries, Argentina provided the most convenient forum. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>On appeal, this Court recognized that the decision of the district court was entitled to deference under a clear abuse of discretion review. <i>Id.</i> at 873. Nonetheless, this Court found that the district court erred for three reasons:</p>\n<blockquote>First, the district court did not apply the deference required for a forum choice made by a U.S. plaintiff under <i>Koster v. American Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Co.,</i> 330 U.S. 518, 524, 67 S.Ct. 828, 91 L.Ed. 1067 (1947). Second, the district <span class=\"star-pagination\">*525</span> court erred in its weighing of the relative ease of access to documents and live testimony. Third, the district court, in balancing the convenience of the alternative forums, disregarded a substantial portion of plaintiff's claims.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> All of these reasons are implicated in the case before us. We address each one in turn.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Deference to Plaintiff's Forum Selection</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The district court failed to accord the appropriate degree of deference to Zions' selection of Michigan as the forum for prosecuting this action. Indeed, the district court's ruling does not mention, and does not appear to have considered, the deference that a plaintiff's choice of forum is normally accorded, or the fact that it was Zions, a U.S. plaintiff, that made the forum selection. In this appeal, MDM contends that the deference normally given to a plaintiff's choice of a forum does not apply when the forum is not the \"home\" of the plaintiff. <i>See </i><i>Piper Aircraft,</i> 454 U.S. at 255-56, 102 S.Ct. 252 (noting that a foreign plaintiff's choice of forum does not carry the same assumption that its choice of forum is convenient as does the choice of a plaintiff bringing suit in its home forum). Zions, a Utah corporation, brought this case in Michigan, where it is not a resident. Unlike the Scottish plaintiff in <i>Piper Aircraft,</i> however, Zions is not a <i>foreign</i> plaintiff. It is a corporation with its principal place of business in Salt Lake City, Utah, and therefore a U.S. plaintiff. Thus, the lesser standard of deference to a plaintiff's choice of forum does not apply.</p>\n<p>Moreover, Zions has brought this action in the district in which the claims allegedly arose. If the claim by MDM is that Utah is a more convenient forum, then such matter is addressed under 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a). If the claim is that the case is better suited for disposition in Mexico, then the doctrine of <i>forum non conveniens</i> provides the analysis, which includes the strong presumption in favor of the plaintiff's forum selection.</p>\n<p>Although we note that a district court need not make an explicit finding that proceeding with the suit in the United States would be oppressive or vexatious to a defendant, <i>Kryvicky v. Scandinavian Airlines Sys.,</i> 807 F.2d 514, 517 (6th Cir. 1986), the <i>forum non conveniens</i> determination must indicate that the district court considered whether any oppression and vexation to a defendant was \"out of all proportion to plaintiff's convenience.\" <i>Koster,</i> 330 U.S. at 524, 67 S.Ct. 828. Here, the district court's opinion does not indicate that it undertook the requisite analysis. Accordingly, the district court erred in failing to accord Zions the strong presumption in favor of its selection of the Eastern District of Michigan as the forum for this case.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>Relative Ease of Access to Documents and Witnesses</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The district court's failure to recognize the strong presumption in favor of Zions' choice of Michigan as the forum for this action is evident in its analysis of the relevant <i>Gulf Oil</i> factors. In that respect, the district court erred in according inordinate weight to the cost of travel and obtaining witnesses.</p>\n<p>The district court's discussion of the private <i>Gulf Oil</i> factors consisted of the following:</p>\n<blockquote>The private interest factorsaccess to sources of proof, location of witnesses weigh in favor of Mexico. All of MDM and Majapara's witnesses are located there. Zions Bank's witnesses are in Utah, although they apparently have traveled to Mexico on business before. The parties have not identified any witnesses in Michigan, except perhaps a custodian of the records of Comerica <span class=\"star-pagination\">*526</span> Bank. MDM's bank records are in Michigan, although it should be a simple matter to transfer those records to Mexico; these records are likely in MDM's possession already as well. As a practical matter, all parties will need to travel to Michigan for trial if the case remains here, which the court believes will be more logistically difficult and expensive than if the case were tried in Mexico.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Zions,</i> 2009 WL 910764, at *3.</p>\n<p>The cost of travel and of obtaining testimony of witnesses is an appropriate consideration in initially determining whether the forum selected by the plaintiff oppresses the defendant. Here, the district court simply noted the potentially greater logistical difficulty and expense entailed by requiring the parties to travel to Michigan instead of Mexico. <i>Id.</i> Such a conclusion does not establish an oppressive or vexatious burden on the defendant, which used a bank in Michigan to conduct the business at issue in this case. The fact that MDM's witnesses are in Mexico is a consideration, but less so given that the gist of this lawsuit is business activity of MDM in Detroit, Michigan.</p>\n<p>With respect to this factor, MDM contends on appeal that Majapara witnesses would resist the giving of testimony in the United States, because the company is allegedly under criminal investigation in Mexico. No such finding was made by the district court, however, and the affidavit cited by MDM indicates only that one officer of the company has been arrested in connection with a criminal investigation, but does not specify whether that officer is actually a witness in this case. (<i>See</i> R. 13 Ex. A. ¶ 5.) As held in <i>Duha,</i> availability of compulsory process, though a consideration, \"is less weighty when it has not been alleged or shown that any witness would be unwilling to testify.\" <i>Duha,</i> 448 F.3d at 877.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. <i>Analysis of the Claims</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Finally, in balancing the convenience of the alternative forums, the district court disregarded a substantial portion of plaintiff's claims. In considering the application of the doctrine of <i>forum non conveniens,</i> a district court must analyze each claim brought, particularly if the causes of action asserted require different types of proof and evidence. <i>Id.</i> at 879. In this case, Zions' claim that it is a holder in due course of a negotiable instrument requires different proof and evidence from its claims for conversion and quantum valebant.<sup>[2]</sup> Thus, the district court was required to evaluate the ease of access to documents and witnesses as that factor pertains to Zions' holder-in-due-course claim separately from its other claims. The district court's discussion, set forth above, offers no separate analysis of the <i>Gulf Oil</i> factorsin particular the ease of access to witnesses and documentswith respect to Zions' claim that MDM is liable to Zions as a holder in due course of a negotiable instrument. Virtually all of the evidence in support of such claim would necessarily be documentary, most of which would presumably be located where the transaction occurred, which was Detroit, Michigan. In sum, the district court did not conduct a separate evaluation of each of the claims to determine which forum was best suited to resolve the litigation, as it was required to do under <i>Duha.</i><sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*527</span> III. <i>CONCLUSION</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Based upon the foregoing, we conclude that the district court did not state adequately its reasons for dismissing Zions' claims on the grounds of <i>forum non conveniens.</i> Accordingly, the decision of the district court is hereby VACATED and the case REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  The Honorable Edmund A. Sargus, Jr., United States District Judge for the Southern District of Ohio, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  As explained by the Supreme Court, the doctrine is \"a supervening venue provision, permitting displacement of the ordinary rules of venue when, in light of certain conditions, the trial court thinks that jurisdiction ought to be declined.\" <i>Am. Dredging Co. v. Miller,</i> 510 U.S. 443, 453, 114 S.Ct. 981, 127 L.Ed.2d 285 (1994). Following enactment of 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a) in 1962, the doctrine of <i>forum non conveniens</i> now applies only in cases in which the alternative forum is in another country. If another federal district is an alternative forum, dismissal on grounds of <i>forum non conveniens</i> is inapplicable and § 1404(a) applies. <i>Sinochem Int'l Co. v. Malay. Int'l Shipping Corp.,</i> 549 U.S. 422, 430, 127 S.Ct. 1184, 167 L.Ed.2d 15 (2007).</p>\n<p>[2]  Quantum valebant literally defined as \"as much as they were worth,\" is a claim requiring proof of worth and, at least theoretically, requires more proof than that of a holder in due course. <i>See</i> Webster's Legal Dictionary, 6th ed., p. 1244.</p>\n<p>[3]  We note that in considering each discrete claim under the <i>Gulf Oil</i> factors, the district court is free to conclude that some claims survive a <i>forum non conveniens</i> challenge, while others do not. <i>See </i><i>Boosey &amp; Hawkes Music Publishers, Ltd. v.

Adolfo Campero, Jr., Campero &amp; Becerra, Laredo, Texas, for Appellee.</p>\n<p>Before: GIBBONS and KETHLEDGE, Circuit Judges; SARGUS, District Judge.<sup>[*]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>OPINION</h2>\n<p>SARGUS, District Judge.</p>\n<p>From December 10, 2007, through December 14, 2007, Moto Diesel Mexicana, S.A. de C.V. (\"MDM\") issued eight checks totaling $2 million to Casa de Cambio Majapara S.A. de C.V. (\"Majapara\"). The <span class=\"star-pagination\">*523</span> checks were drawn on MDM's account at Comerica Bank in Detroit, Michigan. On December 14 and 18, 2007, Majapara attempted to deposit all the funds from the eight checks into its account at Zions First National Bank in Salt Lake City, Utah (\"Zions\"). In turn, Majapara withdrew the $2 million from its account at Zions. Thereafter, however, Comerica Bank notified Zions that the checks from MDM had been dishonored because of insufficient funds. Ultimately, Zions suffered a loss of $2 million.</p>\n<p>Zions brought suit against MDM alleging (1) holder in due course status; (2) conversion; and (3) quantum valebant. In response to the Complaint, MDM filed three motions to dismiss, under F.R. Civ. P. 12(b)(2), (5) and (6). Several months later, before disposition of the pending motions, MDM filed a motion to dismiss on the grounds of <i>forum non conveniens.</i> On April 1, 2009, the district court granted the motion to dismiss on the grounds of <i>forum non conveniens</i> and denied as moot the other pending motions.</p>\n<p>Zions thereafter filed a motion for reconsideration, which the district court denied. A timely appeal followed. On appeal, Zions argues that the district court erred in dismissing its claims on <i>forum non conveniens</i> grounds. For the reasons that follow, we VACATE the decision of the district court and REMAND for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. <i>STANDARD OF REVIEW</i>\n</h2>\n<p>We review for clear abuse of discretion a district court's determination that the doctrine of <i>forum non conveniens</i> requires dismissal of a case. <i>Duha v.

In that respect, the district court erred in according inordinate weight to the cost of travel and obtaining witnesses.</p>\n<p>The district court's discussion of the private <i>Gulf Oil</i> factors consisted of the following:</p>\n<blockquote>The private interest factorsaccess to sources of proof, location of witnesses weigh in favor of Mexico. All of MDM and Majapara's witnesses are located there. Zions Bank's witnesses are in Utah, although they apparently have traveled to Mexico on business before. The parties have not identified any witnesses in Michigan, except perhaps a custodian of the records of Comerica <span class=\"star-pagination\">*526</span> Bank. MDM's bank records are in Michigan, although it should be a simple matter to transfer those records to Mexico; these records are likely in MDM's possession already as well. As a practical matter, all parties will need to travel to Michigan for trial if the case remains here, which the court believes will be more logistically difficult and expensive than if the case were tried in Mexico.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Zions,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2009</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">910764</span></span>, at *3.</p>\n<p>The cost of travel and of obtaining testimony of witnesses is an appropriate consideration in initially determining whether the forum selected by the plaintiff oppresses the defendant. Here, the district court simply noted the potentially greater logistical difficulty and expense entailed by requiring the parties to travel to Michigan instead of Mexico. <i>Id.</i> Such a conclusion does not establish an oppressive or vexatious burden on the defendant, which used a bank in Michigan to conduct the business at issue in this case. The fact that MDM's witnesses are in Mexico is a consideration, but less so given that the gist of this lawsuit is business activity of MDM in Detroit, Michigan.</p>\n<p>With respect to this factor, MDM contends on appeal that Majapara witnesses would resist the giving of testimony in the United States, because the company is allegedly under criminal investigation in Mexico. No such finding was made by the district court, however, and the affidavit cited by MDM indicates only that one officer of the company has been arrested in connection with a criminal investigation, but does not specify whether that officer is actually a witness in this case. (<i>See</i> R. 13 Ex. A. ¶ 5.) As held in <i>Duha,</i> availability of compulsory process, though a consideration, \"is less weighty when it has not been alleged or shown that any witness would be unwilling to testify.\" <i>Duha,</i> 448 F.3d at 877.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. <i>Analysis of the Claims</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Finally, in balancing the convenience of the alternative forums, the district court disregarded a substantial portion of plaintiff's claims. In considering the application of the doctrine of <i>forum non conveniens,</i> a district court must analyze each claim brought, particularly if the causes of action asserted require different types of proof and evidence. <i>Id.</i> at 879. In this case, Zions' claim that it is a holder in due course of a negotiable instrument requires different proof and evidence from its claims for conversion and quantum valebant.<sup>[2]</sup> Thus, the district court was required to evaluate the ease of access to documents and witnesses as that factor pertains to Zions' holder-in-due-course claim separately from its other claims. The district court's discussion, set forth above, offers no separate analysis of the <i>Gulf Oil</i> factorsin particular the ease of access to witnesses and documentswith respect to Zions' claim that MDM is liable to Zions as a holder in due course of a negotiable instrument. Virtually all of the evidence in support of such claim would necessarily be documentary, most of which would presumably be located where the transaction occurred, which was Detroit, Michigan. In sum, the district court did not conduct a separate evaluation of each of the claims to determine which forum was best suited to resolve the litigation, as it was required to do under <i>Duha.</i><sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*527</span> III. <i>CONCLUSION</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Based upon the foregoing, we conclude that the district court did not state adequately its reasons for dismissing Zions' claims on the grounds of <i>forum non conveniens.</i> Accordingly, the decision of the district court is hereby VACATED and the case REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  The Honorable Edmund A.

Following enactment of 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a) in 1962, the doctrine of <i>forum non conveniens</i> now applies only in cases in which the alternative forum is in another country. If another federal district is an alternative forum, dismissal on grounds of <i>forum non conveniens</i> is inapplicable and § 1404(a) applies. <i>Sinochem Int'l Co. v. Malay.
