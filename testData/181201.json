United States, 131 S. Ct. 18 (Nov. 15, 2010), after\nthe Supreme Court vacated our judgment and remanded it to us in light of the Abbott\ncase.\n\n        Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                           1\n\fNo. 08-6027             United States v.

The Supreme Court has\nnow decided that the phrase “any other provision of law” has a meaning exactly opposite\nto the ordinary meaning of the words. This mode of interpretation was sometimes\nfollowed in the early days of the Common Law in the time of Edward I and II in the 13th\nand 14th Centuries when the judges would sometimes correct the legislative language\nand reverse the meaning of a statute under a doctrine of interpretation called “The Equity\nof the Statute.” Looking back some four centuries later, Blackstone said the early judges\nwould sometimes change the statute when “the law (by reason of its universality) is\ndeficient” and needed correction or the judges had participated in making the statute and\nknew what it was supposed to mean. A fuller description of this practice is found in\nPlucknett, A Concise History of the Common Law, 331-35 (5th ed. 1956). In this case,\na unanimous Supreme Court engaged in a similar instance of 13th Century “originalism”\nby interpreting the “equity” of a statute to mean just the opposite of what the words say\nbecause the Court believed it knew the intended meaning of the statute.\n\n        Here the district court, at the request of the government, piled two mandatory\nminimum sentences on top of each other, one a 10-year drug sentence, the second a 5-\nyear firearms sentence connected to the drug sentence. Our court set the 5-year firearms\nsentence aside under the words of the firearms statute that state expressly that the 5-year\nsentence should not be imposed at all “to the extent that a greater minimum sentence is\notherwise provided . . . by any other provision of law.” United States v. Almany,\n598 F.3d 238, 241-42 (6th Cir. 2010) (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A) (emphasis\nadded)).1 The Supreme Court reversed our decision. We were wrong because in these\nkinds of statutes, Congress normally intends to make sentences longer, not shorter, more\nsevere, not less. Abbott v. United States, 131 S. Ct. 18 (Nov. 15, 2010). The Supreme\n\n\n        1\n            The statute in question reads:\n        Except to the extent that a greater minimum sentence is otherwise provided by this\n        subsection or by any other provision of law, any person who, during and in relation to\n        any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime . . . uses or carries a firearm, or who, in\n        furtherance of any such crime, possesses a firearm, shall, in addition to the punishment\n        provided for such crime of violence or drug trafficking crime [receive a five year\n        mandatory minimum, consecutive sentence].\n18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A) (emphasis added).\n\fNo. 08-6027        United States v. Almany                                          Page 3\n\n\nCourt understood, it said, that the lesser sentence resulting from the express words “any\nother provision of law” of the statute “project a rational, less harsh, mode of sentencing.\nBut we do not think it was the mode Congress ordered.” Slip op. at 13. Having\nobserved that the “less harsh”construction was a rational construction, the Court then\nsaid that the “grammatical possibility of a defendant’s interpretation does not command\na resort to the rule of lenity if the interpretation proffered by the defendant reflects an\nimplausible reading of the congressional purpose.” Id. at 18 n.9 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). Thus, apparently the rule of lenity based on ambiguous language does\nnot operate when the court resorts to the “Equity of the Statute” to give it a construction\nopposite to the meaning the words ordinarily signify because the Court knows that what\nthe legislature intended was not what it wrote. Nothing is mentioned about an ex post\nfacto problem when a statute is interpreted contrary to its words. The Supreme Court\nis “final but not infallible” and we must follow their interpretation of statutes. The\n“Equity of the Statute” doctrine is alive and well — although unmentioned by the\nSupreme Court — more than seven centuries after its origin at common law.\n\n                                               ENTERED BY ORDER OF THE COURT\n\n\n                                                     /s/ Leonard Green\n                                               ___________________________________\n                                                             Clerk\n\f",
