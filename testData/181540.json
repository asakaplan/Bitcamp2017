The United\nStates moves to intervene in the appeal to address two issues: (1) whether a policy\nstatement issued by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development\nis unconstitutionally vague; and (2) whether that policy statement is entitled to\ndeference. The plaintiffs support the intervention of the government, and the defendants\noppose the motion to intervene.\n\n       On appeal, we may grant either intervention of right or permissive intervention.\nNe. Ohio Coal. for Homeless & Serv. Emps. Int’l Union, Local 1199 v. Blackwell, 467\nF.3d 999, 1006 (6th Cir. 2006); see Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(a), (b)(2).

The defendants argue that the government’s motion is not timely and\nthey are prejudiced by the failure of the government to intervene in the district court.\nThe failure of the government to intervene in the district court does not preclude its\nintervention on appeal. See United States v. Locke, 529 U.S. 89, 98 (2000). We find the\ngovernment’s motion to be timely and conclude that its intervention in this appeal will\nnot unduly prejudice the defendants.\n\n       In addition, the plaintiffs move to file their appellate brief under seal, stating that\nit will disclose confidential financial material that is protected by two confidentiality\nagreements entered into in the district court. The defendants support the motion to file\nunder seal.\n\n       The public has the right “to inspect and copy judicial documents and files.” In\nre Knoxville News-Sentinel Co., Inc., 723 F.2d 470, 474 (6th Cir. 1983). Thus,\ndocuments filed in the court generally must be made available to the public. See Procter\n& Gamble Co. v. Bankers Trust Co., 78 F.3d 219, 227 (6th Cir. 1996). To the extent that\nthe appellate briefs contain confidential financial information, they may be filed under\nseal. If the court later determines that the sealed information is not confidential, it may\nbe unsealed. See, e.g., Elliot Co. v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 2009 WL 750780, at *9 (6th\nCir. 2009) (unpublished) (ordering briefs and other documents unsealed after concluding\nthat the motion to seal “presents no legally sufficient reason for sealing”); United States\nv. Green, 532 F.3d 538, 542 n.2 (6th Cir. 2008), cert. denied, 129 S. Ct. 2735 (2009).\n\n       The motion to intervene by the United States is GRANTED. The plaintiffs’\nmotion to seal their brief is GRANTED, without prejudice to reconsideration should it\nappear that they have sealed matters that should be made available to the public. A\npublic version of the brief, redacting the confidential information, must also be filed.\n\n                                                ENTERED BY ORDER OF THE COURT\n\n                                                        /s/ Leonard Green\n                                                ___________________________________\n                                                                 Clerk\n\f",
