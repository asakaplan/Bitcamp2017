Cleland, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of\nMichigan, sitting by designation.\n\n\n                                               1\n\fNo. 09-5730        United States v.

We AFFIRM.\n\n                                 I. BACKGROUND\n\n       The Knox County Sheriff’s Office utilized a confidential informant to conduct\na series of “controlled buys” of crack cocaine from a seller known as “Ace” at 1537\nVirginia Avenue in Knoxville, Tennessee. Based on these purchases, the Sheriff’s\nOffice obtained a search warrant to seize drugs from the premises.\n\n       On September 18, 2007, officers executed the search warrant. The officers\nknocked and announced their presence; however, no one answered the door. The\nofficers therefore used a ram to forcibly enter the house. Upon entry, the officers\nencountered Jabari Sheffield, also known as “Jam,” and two small children in the living\narea. In securing the house, officers located a bedroom door that they were unable to\nopen easily.\n\n       The officers forcibly opened the door and found Ham hiding in the bedroom\ncloset. At Ham’s feet, on the closet floor, officers recovered 37.4 grams of crack\ncocaine. Also in the closet was a black case containing ammunition and an unloaded\n.380-caliber pistol, which had been reported stolen from an individual in Knox County\nin 2006. On top of an armoire near the closet, approximately head-high, officers located\na loaded 9 mm handgun. The officers found and seized $1,008 in cash from Ham’s\npockets, the bed, the armoire, and a shoebox in the closet. The officers also seized a box\nof various ammunition, plastic baggies, and a set of digital scales from the bedroom, as\nwell as three cellular telephones from the house. A plate with a razor blade and white\nresidue on it was located in the bathroom.\n\n       Ham was arrested and transported to a detention facility. Upon booking, Ham’s\ntattoos—an “Ace of Spades” and a dagger—were photographed. Ham was charged with\n\fNo. 09-5730         United States v. Ham                                              Page 3\n\n\npossession with intent to distribute five grams or more of crack, possession of a firearm\nin furtherance of a drug trafficking crime, and being a felon in possession of a firearm.\n\n        A jury convicted Ham of all counts on October 16, 2008. The district court\nsentenced Ham to an effective term of imprisonment of 190 months, followed by eight\nyears of supervised release. Ham now appeals.\n\n                                      II. ANALYSIS\n\nA. Evidentiary Issues\n\n        1. Standard of Review\n\n        Generally, “[w]e review the district court’s admission or exclusion of evidence\nfor an abuse of discretion.” United States v. Davis, 514 F.3d 596, 611 (6th Cir. 2008)\n(quoting United States v. Ganier, 468 F.3d 920, 925 (6th Cir. 2006)). However, if the\ncomplaining party fails to object in the district court, we review for plain error. United\nStates v. Cowart, 90 F.3d 154, 157 (6th Cir. 1996).\n\n        2. Agent Dave Lewis\n\n                a. Relevance and Probative Value\n\n        Agent Dave Lewis, a special agent with the Drug Enforcement Administration\n(“DEA”) for approximately twenty-two years, testified regarding the characteristics of\ncrack cocaine as well as the methods involved in the distribution of the drug. Defendant\nargues that the district court abused its discretion because it failed to assess the relevance\nand probative value of Agent Lewis’s testimony before he was permitted to testify.\nDefendant did not raise this specific objection during trial; therefore, we review the\ndistrict court’s decision for plain error.\n\n        We have previously rejected an identical challenge in United States v. Alford,\n332 F. App’x 275, 281 (6th Cir. 2009), in which the defendant argued that “the district\ncourt’s failure to assess the relevancy and probative value of Agent Lewis’s testimony\nprior to its admission was plain error.” Id. We noted that “this Court has consistently\n\fNo. 09-5730        United States v. Ham                                             Page 4\n\n\nheld that expert testimony by a law enforcement officer about the method of operation\nof drug dealers is admissible pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 702,” id. (citing United States v.\nThomas, 74 F.3d 676, 682 (6th Cir. 1996)), and that “this Court has deemed Agent Lewis\nqualified in this area,” id. (citing United States v. List, 200 F. App’x 535, 545 (6th Cir.\n2006)). We found no plain error in the admission of Agent Lewis’s testimony,\ndetermining that it was “highly relevant and helped the jury in resolving the central issue\nof whether [the defendant] possessed the crack with intent to distribute.” Id. at 281-82.\nThere is no reason to reach a different conclusion in this case. The district court\nproperly admitted the expert testimony of Agent Lewis.\n\n               b. Personal Use Quantities\n\n       Defendant argues that the district court clearly erred by allowing Agent Lewis\nto testify beyond his area of expertise. Specifically, Defendant contends that Agent\nLewis’s background and training does not qualify him to testify to the quantities of crack\nthat are consistent with personal use. This argument is without merit. As we stated in\nAlford, “[t]his Court routinely allows qualified law enforcement officials to testify that\ncircumstances are consistent with drug distribution rather than personal use.” Alford,\n332 F. App’x at 282 (citing United States v. Swafford, 385 F.3d 1026, 1030 (6th Cir.\n2004) (and cases therein); United States v. Combs, 369 F.3d 925, 940 (6th Cir. 2004);\nUnited States v. Thomas, 74 F.3d 676, 682 (6th Cir. 1996)). There was no plain error.\n\n               c. Cellular Telephones\n\n       Defendant also argues that Agent Lewis’s testimony concerning “throw-away”\ncellular telephones was beyond the scope of his expertise, irrelevant, and unduly\nprejudicial. Agent Lewis testified, without objection, that drug traffickers often use\nthrow-away phones because they can be set up with a fictitious name, making them\nuntraceable. Defendant argues that this testimony was improper because there was no\nevidence in the record that Defendant used any of the three phones in the manner\ndescribed by Agent Lewis.\n\fNo. 09-5730        United States v. Ham                                             Page 5\n\n\n       The testimony was within the scope of Agent Lewis’s expertise because it\nconcerned a “method of operation of drug dealers.” Id. at 281. Agent Lewis’s\ntestimony explaining why the items seized from the house were consistent with drug\ndealing was relevant to the issue of whether Defendant intended to distribute the drugs\nfound with him in the bedroom closet. See Thomas, 74 F.3d at 682 (“[W]ithout expert\ntestimony, the average juror is unlikely to understand the significance of drug\nparaphernalia . . . .”). The fact that there was no direct evidence that Defendant used the\ncell phones in the way that Agent Lewis testified is of no consequence. Agent Lewis\nwas not offered to provide percipient testimony directly demonstrating Defendant’s\nactions. Instead, he was providing an opinion, based on extensive training and\nexperience, about the items recovered from the residence and the reasons that they were\nconsistent with drug trafficking. Defendant was free to cross-examine Agent Lewis to\ndemonstrate that there were other legitimate uses for these items. In addition, the jury\nwas instructed that they did not have to accept the opinion testimony and that they\nshould consider how the witness reached his conclusion. Accordingly, we find nothing\nprejudicial in Agent Lewis’s testimony concerning throw-away cellular telephones and\nconclude there was no error in its admission.\n\n       3. Investigator Chris Bryant\n\n       Chris Bryant, an investigator with the narcotics unit of the Knox County Sheriff’s\nOffice, testified predominantly regarding the “controlled buys” and the execution of the\nsearch warrant. He also explained to the jury that items such as scales and plastic\nsandwich bags are used in the drug trade just as they are in the average household: to\nweigh and to package things. Defendant argues that the district court erred by allowing\nBryant’s “transformation from a fact witness to an opinion witness.” (Appellant’s Br.\n12.) Defendant did not object to Bryant’s passing comments about these few items of\nevidence at trial. We review for plain error.\n\n       Although testimony concerning drug dealing is specialized knowledge “not\nwithin the experience of the average juror,” United States v. Lopez-Medina, 461 F.3d\n724, 742 (6th Cir. 2006), we are hard-pressed to declare ourselves convinced that\n\fNo. 09-5730         United States v. Ham                                              Page 6\n\n\nBryant’s testimony concerning plastic baggies and scales constitutes “expert testimony”\nthat must comply with the well-known admissibility requirements. But, for the sake of\ndiscussion, we will address it as if it did.\n\n        The admission of this “expert testimony” presents two issues; neither warrants\nreversal. First, in its Rule 16 disclosure, the Government did not provide Defendant with\nnotice that Bryant would comment about plastic baggies and scales. Nonetheless,\nDefendant was in no way prejudiced by this absence. The Government’s Rule 16\ndisclosure notified Defendant that expert testimony concerning the general practices of\ndrug dealers would be introduced at trial. Defendant thus “did not suffer any surprise,”\na point underscored by his attorney’s silence as Bryant’s brief testimony on these points\nwas heard. United States v. White, 492 F.3d 380, 407 (6th Cir. 2007) (quoting United\nStates v. Tarwater, 308 F.3d 494, 515 (6th Cir. 2002)). More fundamentally, he has\nfailed to show “how the outcome of the case would have been different” had he received\nnotice. Id.\n\n        Second, when a witness gives both fact and expert testimony, the district court\nmust give “a ‘cautionary jury instruction regarding the [witness’s] dual witness roles’”\nor there must be “‘a clear demarcation between [the witness’s] fact testimony and expert\nopinion testimony.’” United States v. Smith, 601 F.3d 530, 540 (6th Cir. 2010) (quoting\nLopez-Medina, 461 F.3d at 745). The district court did not give a dual-witness\ninstruction and there was not a clear demarcation between the fact and expert testimony.\nEven so, Defendant cannot show that this error “affected substantial rights” and\n“seriously affected the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.”\nId. at 541 (quoting United States v. Jones, 108 F.3d 668, 670 (6th Cir. 1997)). The\ndistrict court’s instruction, which told the jurors that they could reject the opinions given\nand that they should consider how the witnesses reached their conclusions, was adequate\nto “guard against the risk of confusion inherent when a law enforcement agent testifies\nas both a fact witness and as an expert witness.” Lopez-Medina, 461 F.3d at 744.\nMoreover, there were no other evidentiary errors in this case. See United States v.\nVasquez, 560 F.3d 461, 470-71 (6th Cir. 2009) (noting that “we have declined to extend\n\fNo. 09-5730         United States v. Ham                                            Page 7\n\n\nthe holding in Lopez-Medina to circumstances in which there were no other evidentiary\nerrors”). And in light of the other substantial evidence of Defendant’s guilt in this case,\nparticularly the distribution quantities of crack cocaine discovered at Defendant’s feet\nin the closet, Investigator Bryant’s “dual testimony here is insufficient to ‘show [] an\nactual effect on the outcome of the case.’” United States v. Martin, 520 F.3d 656, 660\n(6th Cir. 2008) (quoting Lopez-Medina, 461 F.3d at 745) (alteration in original).\nDefendant has not shown that he is entitled to a reversal of his conviction.\n\n         4. Jabari Sheffield’s Crack Cocaine Complaint and Judgment\n\n         Defendant alleges that the district court erred by refusing to admit into evidence\na complaint against Jabari Sheffield for possession of 9.6 grams of crack cocaine for\nresale and a judgment showing her subsequent guilty plea to simple possession of\ncocaine. The complaint states that officers recovered the crack cocaine from Sheffield\non Bonnyman near Oldham, on June 2, 2007.               The district court sustained the\nGovernment’s objection, concluding that the exhibit could not be introduced for\nimpeachment purposes under Federal Rule of Evidence 609 because Sheffield was not\ntestifying and that the exhibit was not relevant to whether Defendant was guilty of the\ncrimes charged. Defendant argues that this was error because the trial court should have\nanalyzed the admissibility under Federal Rule of Evidence 803(8)(C) and 804(b)(3).\n\n         Defendant’s argument misses the mark. The evidence was not excluded because\nit was hearsay, and it does not matter whether an exception to the hearsay rule might\napply.\n\n         Nor do we find that the district court abused its discretion in sustaining the\nGovernment’s objection to evidence that was not relevant. The evidence suggesting that\nSheffield was dealing drugs at another location does not bear on any fact of consequence\nin this case. Sheffield’s potential involvement in drug trafficking activities—others or\nthose implicated in this case—does not make the question of Defendant’s guilt more or\nless likely. Indeed, the Government was not required to prove that it was Defendant, to\nthe exclusion of all others, who possessed the drugs and firearms in this case. Even if\nSheffield jointly possessed the guns and drugs at 1537 Virginia Avenue, Defendant\n\fNo. 09-5730        United States v. Ham                                             Page 8\n\n\ncould still be found guilty. United States v. Gibbs, 182 F.3d 408, 425 (6th Cir. 1999)\n(citing United States v. Craven, 478 F.2d 1329, 1333 (6th Cir. 1973)). The district court\ndid not abuse its discretion in refusing to admit the evidence regarding Jabari Sheffield’s\ncrack cocaine charge and guilty plea.\n\n       5. Stolen Firearm\n\n       Special Agent Rebecca Bobich testified that the .380-caliber pistol recovered\nfrom the bedroom closet was reported stolen in Knox County on October 21, 2006.\nDefendant argues that this evidence was not relevant to any of the offenses charged in\nthis case. Defendant is mistaken. The legality of the possession of a firearm is a factor\nto consider in determining whether the firearm was possessed in furtherance of a drug\ntrafficking offense. United States v. Mackey, 265 F.3d 457, 462 (6th Cir. 2001). Any\nprejudice to Defendant was minimized by the district court instructing the jury, twice,\nthat Defendant was on trial only for the crimes charged in the indictment. R. 42 at 128,\n143. There was no error in the admission of Special Agent Bobich’s testimony.\n\nB. Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n       This Court reviews de novo a defendant’s claim of insufficiency of the evidence.\nUnited States v. Gunter, 551 F.3d 472, 482 (6th Cir. 2009). “In reviewing challenges\nregarding the sufficiency of the evidence presented to the jury, we are limited to\nascertaining whether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the\ngovernment, ‘any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the\ncrime beyond a reasonable doubt.’” United States v. Carmichael, 232 F.3d 510, 519 (6th\nCir. 2000) (quoting Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 319 (1979)).\n\n       1. Possession of Cocaine Base with Intent to Distribute\n\n       “To establish a violation of § 841(a)(1), the government must prove the following\nelements: ‘(1) knowing (2) possession of a controlled substance (3) with intent to\ndistribute.’” Mackey, 265 F.3d at 460 (quoting United States v. Christian, 786 F.2d 203,\n210 (6th Cir. 1986)).\n\fNo. 09-5730           United States v. Ham                                           Page 9\n\n\n        Defendant argues that, aside from Agent Lewis’s testimony that the crack was\npackaged for distribution and was “way too much for personal use” and Investigator\nBryant’s testimony regarding the scales and baggies, there was insufficient evidence that\nDefendant possessed the crack with intent to distribute. Contrary to Defendant’s\nargument, “all of the evidence is to be considered” when reviewing for sufficiency of the\nevidence. Jackson, 443 U.S. at 319. As discussed above, the admission of Agent\nLewis’s testimony was not error. Therefore, there is no reason to set aside Agent\nLewis’s testimony about how the drugs were arranged for distribution in three-gram\npackages, worth $150 to $200 a piece, and that 37.4 grams, representing a minimum of\n370 doses, is too much for personal use. This is competent evidence that well supports\nthe jury’s verdict.\n\n        Additional evidence also supported the conviction. Investigator Bryant testified\nthat the confidential informant made a series of controlled buys from a person he\nreferred to as “Ace” at 1537 Virginia Avenue. Defendant sports an “Ace of Spades”\ntattoo, and was within a locked bedroom at that Virginia Avenue address. Defendant’s\nplan to avoid apprehension was to hide in the closet with more than 37 grams of crack\ncocaine at his feet. Any reasonable jury could have concluded that Defendant was the\nsame “Ace” who was selling drugs to the confidential informant. We wonder what jury\nwould not reach that conclusion. Moreover, the jury could have inferred solely from the\npossession of this large quantity of drugs that Defendant intended to further distribute\nit. United States v. Haywood, 280 F.3d 715, 724 (6th Cir. 2002) (18 grams of crack\ncocaine sufficient for an inference of intent to distribute); United States v. Clemons, 9\nF. App’x 286, 289 (6th Cir. 2001) (8.5 grams of crack cocaine “was large enough to\ndraw an inference of intent to distribute”). In addition, Investigator Bryant testified that\nfirearms were recovered nearby the drugs, $1,008 was recovered from the bedroom, and\nno drug paraphernalia to use the crack was recovered. See United States v. Wilson, 27\nF.3d 1126, 1133 (6th Cir. 1994) (recognizing “the connection between guns and drug\ntrafficking”); United States v. Collier, 246 F. App’x 321, 330 (6th Cir. 2007) (recovery\nof $1,900 from the defendant’s pocket supported conclusion that the defendant was\nselling drugs). The evidence presented was more than sufficient to support the jury’s\n\fNo. 09-5730         United States v. Ham                                         Page 10\n\n\nfinding, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Defendant was guilty of possessing crack with\nintent to distribute.\n\n        2. Possession of a Firearm in Furtherance of a Drug Trafficking Offense\n\n        Under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c), any person “who, in furtherance of [a drug trafficking]\ncrime, possesses a firearm, shall, in addition to the punishment provided for [the] drug\ntrafficking crime– (i) be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 5 years.”\n18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A)(i). To prove the possession was “in furtherance of” the drug\ntrafficking crime, the Government must show a “specific nexus between the gun and the\ncrime charged” and that the firearm “was strategically located so that it is quickly and\neasily available for use.” Mackey, 265 F.3d at 462. Other factors to consider include:\n(1) “whether the gun was loaded,” (2) “the type of weapon,” (3) “the legality of its\npossession,” (4) “the type of drug activity conducted,” and (5) “the time and\ncircumstances under which the firearm was found.” Id.\n\n        We applied the Mackey factors in Swafford and concluded that each of the factors\nsupported the conclusion that the defendant possessed the firearm “in furtherance of” the\ndrug offenses.     Swafford, 385 F.3d at 1029.       There, the firearm was a loaded\nsemiautomatic pistol found within arm’s reach of where the defendant was lying. Id.\nA DEA Agent testified that these weapons “play a role in drug distribution, as dealers\ncarry them for protection and intimidation purposes.” Id. The defendant was a\nconvicted felon and could not lawfully possess the gun. Id. Also, “the gun was\ndiscovered as the officers executed a search warrant looking for drugs, which they\nultimately found.” Id. Even though the drugs were not found in the same room as the\ngun, we concluded that the evidence was sufficient to support the defendant’s\nconviction. Id.\n\n        Application of the factors from Mackey leads us to the same conclusion. The\nloaded 9 mm pistol in this case was located about head-high on top of an armoire\nsituated just outside the closet where the drugs were found. It was “strategically located\nso that it [was] quickly and easily available for use.” Mackey, 265 F.3d at 462. Similar\nto the DEA Agent’s testimony in Swafford, Agent Lewis testified that persons involved\n\fNo. 09-5730         United States v. Ham                                            Page 11\n\n\nin drug trafficking almost always have guns because “[i]t’s an illegal business, and the\nonly way they can protect this illegal business is through violence or the threat of\nviolence.” R. 42 at 77. Like Swafford, Defendant could not lawfully possess a handgun\nbecause he was a convicted felon. Swafford, 385 F.3d at 1029. Also, as in Swafford,\n“the gun was discovered as the officers executed a search warrant looking for drugs,\nwhich they ultimately found.” Id. The nexus between the offense and gun is even\nstronger than in Swafford because the gun was found in closer proximity to the drugs,\ni.e., in the same room. We conclude that a rational trier of fact could have found beyond\na reasonable doubt that Defendant possessed a firearm in furtherance of a drug\ntrafficking offense.\n\nC. District Court’s Instructions\n\n        1. Failure to Give a Cautionary Instruction\n\n        Defendant argues that the district court’s failure to give a cautionary instruction\nfollowing Agent Lewis’s testimony was plain error. This Court addressed a similar\nchallenge to a district court’s failure to give a cautionary instruction following Agent\nLewis’s testimony in Alford. 332 F. App’x at 282. We found no plain error because,\nwhen the district court charged the jury the morning after the one-day trial, it gave a\ncautionary instruction on opinion testimony that was the same as the instruction in\nSwafford. Id. at 282-83.\n\n        The district court here gave a cautionary jury instruction regarding opinion\ntestimony that was very similar to the charge given in Swafford. 385 F.3d at 1030 n.4.\nIn addition, the district court gave a general instruction about weighing witness\ntestimony. These instructions were given mere hours after Agent Lewis testified.\nAccordingly, we find no plain error in the district court’s failure to also instruct the jury\nimmediately following Agent Lewis’s testimony.\n\fNo. 09-5730        United States v. Ham                                           Page 12\n\n\n       2. Burden of Proof\n\n       Defendant takes issue with the district court’s instruction to the jury during voire\ndire that “the burden of proof is on the government until the very end of this case.” R.\n41 at 13. Defendant acknowledges that the district court gave an accurate instruction\nafter the close of evidence, and that he did not object to the court’s language during voir\ndire, but argues that the instruction constituted plain error because it implied the burden\nmight shift to Defendant.\n\n       “This court reviews jury instructions as a whole to determine whether they fairly\nand adequately inform the jury of relevant considerations and explain the applicable law\nto assist the jury in reaching its decision.” United States v. Prince, 214 F.3d 740, 760-61\n(6th Cir. 2000) (citing United States v. Layne, 192 F.3d 556, 574 (6th Cir. 1999); United\nStates v. Harrod, 168 F.3d 887, 890 (6th Cir. 1999)) (emphasis added). Reversal is\nwarranted “only if the instructions, viewed as a whole, were confusing, misleading, or\nprejudicial.” Id. (citation and internal quotations omitted).\n\n       The challenged instruction does not suggest a burden shift, and is not improper\nas stated. We believe that a jury would think of “the very end of this case” as that time\nwhen they have rendered a verdict and their service has ended.\n\n       In addition, even if the instruction were seen, standing alone, as implying a\nburden shift, the court extensively instructed the jury that it was always the\nGovernment’s burden to prove Defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. There is\nno risk of confusion or misconception to be found here.\n\nD. Prosecutorial Misconduct\n\n       “When we review claims of prosecutorial misconduct, we determine whether the\nprosecutor’s statements were both improper and flagrant.” United States v. Davis, 514\nF.3d 596, 613 (6th Cir. 2008). Flagrancy is evaluated based on four factors: “(1) the\nlikelihood that the remarks of the prosecutor tended to mislead the jury or prejudice the\ndefendant; (2) whether the remarks were isolated or extensive; (3) whether the remarks\nwere deliberately or accidentally made; and (4) the total strength of the evidence against\n\fNo. 09-5730            United States v. Ham                                       Page 13\n\n\nthe defendant.” Id. (quoting Broom v. Mitchell, 441 F.3d 392, 412 (6th Cir. 2006)).\nInappropriate but isolated statements do not warrant a new trial. The prosecutorial\nmisconduct must have been “so pronounced and persistent that it permeate[d] the entire\natmosphere of the trial.” United States v. Bond, 22 F.3d 662, 667 (6th Cir. 1994)\n(quoting United States v. Payne, 2 F.3d 706, 712 (6th Cir. 1993)).\n\n            1. Opening Statements\n\n            Defendant argues—briefly—that he was prejudiced by the Government stating\nduring its opening statement that “on the armoire was some marijuana and some pills.”\nDefendant stated no objection then, but argues now that the statement was irrelevant to\nthe charges against him and no evidence concerning marijuana and pills was introduced\nat trial.\n\n            “Prosecutors should put forth only ‘proper arguments based on the evidence in\nthe record.’” Davis, 514 F.3d at 613 (quoting Broom, 441 F.3d at 412). “The purpose\nof the opening statement of the prosecution is to outline broadly the facts of the case so\nthat the jury will understand the evidence as it unfolds.” United States v. Signer, 482\nF.2d 394, 399 (6th Cir. 1973).\n\n            The prosecutor’s opening statement, to the extent that it referred briefly to\n“marijuana and pills” purportedly found during the search was not later supported by\ntestimony. But we find no basis to conclude that the statement was flagrant, even though\nit was, by one measure or another, a mistake. It was an isolated remark and, given that\nthe specifics of the search warrant execution would be a focus of the trial, there is no\nindication that it was a deliberate attempt to inject inflammatory or damning “evidence”\nthat was never to be introduced. Moreover, the district court instructed the jury twice\nthat the statements and arguments of attorneys are not evidence. R. 41 at 68; R. 42 at\n123. The prosecutor’s fleeting reference to “pills” and “marijuana” was, in this case, of\nno more import than a few stray raindrops in a shower. It was in no way “so pronounced\nand persistent that it permeate[d] the entire atmosphere of the trial.” Bond, 22 F.3d at\n667. Accordingly, we find no reversible error.\n\fNo. 09-5730             United States v. Ham                                                         Page 14\n\n\n         2. Closing Arguments\n\n         Defendant argues that the Government improperly referred to the names of his\nprior convictions—possession of cocaine with intent to sell and possession of a handgun\nby a felon—during its closing argument.1 The Government referred to the names a total\nof four times—twice during its initial closing argument and twice during its rebuttal.\n\n         Three of the instances are clearly in reference to the proper argument that\nDefendant is a convicted felon, an element of the crime of being a felon in possession\nof a firearm. Defendant cites no authority precluding the Government from referring to\nproperly admitted evidence that is essential to the Government’s case-in-chief during\nclosing arguments. Although statements that are permissible in isolation may, in\naggregate, demonstrate an improper purpose, we find no evidence of an improper\npurpose in this case.\n\n         Nonetheless, the fourth instance, in which the Government appeals to the jury’s\n“common sense,” comes close to the line. Based on the context, it is unclear whether the\nGovernment was suggesting that the jury consider the prior convictions as propensity\nevidence, evidence of an intent to distribute, or evidence that Defendant was a convicted\nfelon. The reference is sufficiently ambiguous that it is unlikely the jury would view this\nas an invitation to consider the evidence for an improper purpose. Moreover, the district\ncourt gave a limiting instruction explicitly informing the jury that they may consider the\nprior convictions only as evidence relating to the element of Defendant having been\npreviously convicted of a felony. The general rule is that a jury is presumed to follow\nthe district court’s instructions, see United States v. Moreno, 933 F.2d 362, 368 (6th Cir.\n\n\n         1\n           During oral argument, Defendant clarified that his argument concerning his prior convictions\nwas based on a theory of prosecutorial misconduct. In his brief, Defendant argues that the probative value\nof the evidence of his prior convictions is substantially outweighed by its prejudicial effect. This argument\nalso fails. The Government was obligated to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Defendant had a\nprevious felony conviction. See United States v. Jones, 159 F.3d 969, 978 (6th Cir. 1998). Had Defendant\noffered to stipulate to this element of the offense, it would have been an abuse of discretion for the district\ncourt to reject it. Old Chief v. United States, 519 U.S. 172, 174 (1997). But he did not. The well-worn\nOld Chief ball was in Defendant’s court, and he either failed or affirmatively decided to not act. The\nprejudice inhering to a defendant in choosing such a course is potentially substantial, but there can be “no\nquestion” that the probative value of the evidence of Defendant’s prior convictions is not substantially\noutweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. United States v. Grimmond, 137 F.3d 823, 833 (4th Cir.\n1998) (citation omitted).\n\fNo. 09-5730        United States v. Ham                                           Page 15\n\n\n1991), and we see no reason why the jury in this case would have been unable to heed\nthese instructions. Accordingly, we find no plain error.\n\nE. Sentencing\n\n       We also consider whether the consecutive component of Defendant’s 190-month\nsentence was proper. Defendant was sentenced to 130 months for possession with intent\nto distribute cocaine base, 120 months for being a felon in possession of a firearm (to run\nconcurrently with the 130 months), and 60 months for possessing a firearm in\nfurtherance of a drug trafficking offense. The 60-month consecutive sentence was\nimposed under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) as the mandatory minimum sentence for possessing\na firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking offense. Defendant challenges the\nimposition of this sentence under § 924(c), arguing that it is inconsistent with our\ndecision in United States v. Almany, 598 F.3d 238 (6th Cir. 2010), vacated, No. 09-1497,\n2010 WL 2300485 (Nov. 29, 2010). After oral argument, the parties submitted\nsupplemental briefs in which they agreed that this sentence runs contrary to Almany’s\nlesson that the mandatory minimum sentences provided in § 924(c) do not apply to\ndefendants who face longer mandatory sentences under other provisions of law. 598\nF.3d at 242. The Government, however, challenged the validity of Almany and\nrequested the court defer decision until the Supreme Court released its decision on the\ninterpretation of § 924(c) in Abbott v. United States, No. 09-479, which was issued on\nNovember 15, 2010.\n\n       As in this case, the sentence in Almany included a ten year mandatory sentence\nfor drug trafficking offenses and a five year mandatory sentence for possession of a\nfirearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A). 598\nF.3d at 241. Section 924(c) reads, in relevant part:\n\n       Except to the extent that a greater minimum sentence is otherwise\n       provided by this subsection or by any other provision of law, any person\n       who, . . . in furtherance of any such crime, possesses a firearm, shall, in\n       addition the punishment provided for such crime of violence or drug\n       trafficking crime - (i) be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less\n       than 5 years; (ii) if the firearm is brandished, be sentenced to a term of\n       imprisonment of not less than 7 years; and (iii) if the firearm is\n\fNo. 09-5730         United States v. Ham                                           Page 16\n\n\n        discharged, be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 10\n        years.\n\n18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A) (emphasis added). Upon indistinguishable facts, the Almany\npanel held that the plain language of the statute proscribes application of the five year\nmandatory minimum sentence together with a longer mandatory minimum sentence. 598\nF.3d at 242. Quoting with approval the case of United States v. Whitley, 529 F.3d 150,\n156 (2d Cir. 2008), the court noted that “we have repeatedly been instructed to give\nstatutes a literal reading and apply the plain meaning of the words Congress used.”\nAlmany, 598 F.3d 242. The court then interpreted the “except” clause reference to “any\nother provision of law” to except from the mandatory minimum sentence of § 924(c)\nthose cases where a defendant receives a greater mandatory sentence under any law. Id.\n\n        The Supreme Court’s opinion in Abbott, however, held that the language in\n§ 924(c) refers only to other provisions imposing longer mandatory sentences “for the\nconduct § 924(c) proscribes, i.e., possessing a firearm in connection with a predicate\ncrime.” 131 S. Ct. 18, 26 (2010). Looking to the history of § 924(c) and the structure\nof the section, the Court in Abbott construed the “except” clause to apply only to\nprovisions mandating a more severe sentence for the use of firearms in the commission\nof a crime. Id. The Court examined the history of the statute, particularly noting the title\nof the 1998 revision evinced a clear intent “to throttle the criminal use of guns.” Id. at\n27. Considering the interaction with other statutes, the Court in Abbott emphasized the\n“sentencing anomalies” that would result from a plain reading of the language “any other\nprovision of law.” Id. Under a literal interpretation of § 924(c), as in Almany, a\ndefendant facing a five-year mandatory sentence for distributing a small quantity of\ndrugs would face the additional mandatory seven years if he brandished a firearm,\nwhereas a similarly situated defendant who distributed a quantity sufficient to require\na ten-year mandatory sentence for distribution would be saved by the “except” clause.\nId. A more cabined application of the phrase “any other provision of law” was\ndetermined necessary to “give[] effect to the statutory language commanding that all\n§ 924(c) offenders shall receive additional punishment for their violation of that\nprovision.” Id. at 29.\n\fNo. 09-5730         United States v. Ham                                        Page 17\n\n\n       After deciding Abbott, the Supreme Court granted certiorari and vacated Almany.\nNo. 09-1497, 2010 WL 2300485 (Nov. 29, 2010). Under Abbott, a mandatory minimum\nsentence under § 924(c) must run consecutively with any mandatory sentences for\npredicate crimes, as well as for other unrelated crimes. The “except” clause in § 924(c)\nprohibits only the imposition of multiple consecutive mandatory sentences under § 924\nfor using a firearm in the commission of a violent or drug trafficking crime. 131 S. Ct.\nat 29. Accordingly, a mandatory seven-year sentence for brandishing a firearm in the\ncommission of certain crimes would be merged into a mandatory ten-year sentence for\ndischarging it, and a mandatory five-year sentence for possessing a firearm in the\ncommission of certain crimes would be merged into a mandatory seven-year sentence\nfor brandishing it. Id. at 23.\n\n                                 III. CONCLUSION\n\n       Defendant’s five-year mandatory sentence under § 924(c) was proper even in\nview of his ten-year mandatory sentence under § 841. The judgment of conviction of the\ndistrict court is AFFIRMED.\n\f",

Lloyd, Jr., Law Office of Francis L. Lloyd, Jr., Knoxville, Tennessee, for Appellant. Debra A. Breneman, Assistant United States Attorney, Knoxville, Tennessee, for Appellee. ON BRIEF: Francis L. Lloyd, Jr., Law Office of Francis L. Lloyd, Jr., Knoxville, Tennessee, for Appellant. Debra A. Breneman, Hugh B. Ward, Jr., Assistant United States Attorney, Knoxville, Tennessee, for Appellee.</p>\n<p>Before: SILER and SUTTON, Circuit Judges; CLELAND, District Judge.<sup>[*]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>OPINION</h2>\n<p>CLELAND, District Judge.</p>\n<p>Michael Rodney Ham appeals his conviction for possession of cocaine base (\"crack\") with intent to distribute, possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking offense, and being a felon in possession of a firearm. Ham objected to few if any of his issues at trial, but now challenges the admission of certain evidence, the sufficiency of the evidence, the district court's jury instructions, certain statements by the Government in opening statement and closing argument, and his consecutive sentence under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c). We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>The Knox County Sheriff's Office utilized a confidential informant to conduct a series of \"controlled buys\" of crack cocaine from a seller known as \"Ace\" at 1537 Virginia Avenue in Knoxville, Tennessee. Based on these purchases, the Sheriff's Office obtained a search warrant to seize drugs from the premises.</p>\n<p>On September 18, 2007, officers executed the search warrant. The officers knocked and announced their presence; however, no one answered the door. The officers therefore used a ram to forcibly enter the house. Upon entry, the officers <span class=\"star-pagination\">*804</span> encountered Jabari Sheffield, also known as \"Jam,\" and two small children in the living area. In securing the house, officers located a bedroom door that they were unable to open easily.</p>\n<p>The officers forcibly opened the door and found Ham hiding in the bedroom closet. At Ham's feet, on the closet floor, officers recovered 37.4 grams of crack cocaine. Also in the closet was a black case containing ammunition and an unloaded.380-caliber pistol, which had been reported stolen from an individual in Knox County in 2006. On top of an armoire near the closet, approximately head-high, officers located a loaded 9 mm handgun. The officers found and seized $1,008 in cash from Ham's pockets, the bed, the armoire, and a shoebox in the closet. The officers also seized a box of various ammunition, plastic baggies, and a set of digital scales from the bedroom, as well as three cellular telephones from the house. A plate with a razor blade and white residue on it was located in the bathroom.</p>\n<p>Ham was arrested and transported to a detention facility. Upon booking, Ham's tattoosan \"Ace of Spades\" and a daggerwere photographed. Ham was charged with possession with intent to distribute five grams or more of crack, possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime, and being a felon in possession of a firearm.</p>\n<p>A jury convicted Ham of all counts on October 16, 2008. The district court sentenced Ham to an effective term of imprisonment of 190 months, followed by eight years of supervised release. Ham now appeals.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. ANALYSIS</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Evidentiary Issues</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Standard of Review</h2>\n<p>Generally, \"[w]e review the district court's admission or exclusion of evidence for an abuse of discretion.\" <i>United States v. Davis,</i> 514 F.3d 596, 611 (6th Cir.2008) (quoting <i>United States v. Ganier,</i> 468 F.3d 920, 925 (6th Cir.2006)). However, if the complaining party fails to object in the district court, we review for plain error. <i>United States v. Cowart,</i> 90 F.3d 154, 157 (6th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Agent Dave Lewis</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>a. Relevance and Probative Value</h2>\n<p>Agent Dave Lewis, a special agent with the Drug Enforcement Administration (\"DEA\") for approximately twenty-two years, testified regarding the characteristics of crack cocaine as well as the methods involved in the distribution of the drug. Defendant argues that the district court abused its discretion because it failed to assess the relevance and probative value of Agent Lewis's testimony before he was permitted to testify. Defendant did not raise this specific objection during trial; therefore, we review the district court's decision for plain error.</p>\n<p>We have previously rejected an identical challenge in <i>United States v. Alford,</i> 332 Fed.Appx. 275, 281 (6th Cir.2009), in which the defendant argued that \"the district court's failure to assess the relevancy and probative value of Agent Lewis's testimony prior to its admission was plain error.\" <i>Id.</i> We noted that \"this Court has consistently held that expert testimony by a law enforcement officer about the method of operation of drug dealers is admissible pursuant to Fed.R.Evid. 702,\" <i>id.</i> (citing <i>United States v. Thomas,</i> 74 F.3d 676, 682 (6th Cir.1996)), and that \"this Court has deemed Agent Lewis qualified in this area,\" <i>id.</i> (citing <i>United States v. List,</i> 200 Fed.Appx. 535, 545 (6th Cir.2006)). We found no plain error in the admission of Agent Lewis's testimony, determining that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*805</span> it was \"highly relevant and helped the jury in resolving the central issue of whether [the defendant] possessed the crack with intent to distribute.\" <i>Id.</i> at 281-82. There is no reason to reach a different conclusion in this case. The district court properly admitted the expert testimony of Agent Lewis.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>b. Personal Use Quantities</h2>\n<p>Defendant argues that the district court clearly erred by allowing Agent Lewis to testify beyond his area of expertise. Specifically, Defendant contends that Agent Lewis's background and training does not qualify him to testify to the quantities of crack that are consistent with personal use. This argument is without merit. As we stated in <i>Alford,</i> \"[t]his Court routinely allows qualified law enforcement officials to testify that circumstances are consistent with drug distribution rather than personal use.\" <i>Alford,</i> 332 Fed.Appx. at 282 (citing <i>United States v. Swafford,</i> 385 F.3d 1026, 1030 (6th Cir.2004) (and cases therein); <i>United States v. Combs,</i> 369 F.3d 925, 940 (6th Cir.2004); <i>United States v. Thomas,</i> 74 F.3d 676, 682 (6th Cir.1996)). There was no plain error.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>c. Cellular Telephones</h2>\n<p>Defendant also argues that Agent Lewis's testimony concerning \"throw-away\" cellular telephones was beyond the scope of his expertise, irrelevant, and unduly prejudicial. Agent Lewis testified, without objection, that drug traffickers often use throw-away phones because they can be set up with a fictitious name, making them untraceable. Defendant argues that this testimony was improper because there was no evidence in the record that Defendant used any of the three phones in the manner described by Agent Lewis.</p>\n<p>The testimony was within the scope of Agent Lewis's expertise because it concerned a \"method of operation of drug dealers.\" <i>Id.</i> at 281. Agent Lewis's testimony explaining why the items seized from the house were consistent with drug dealing was relevant to the issue of whether Defendant intended to distribute the drugs found with him in the bedroom closet. <i>See </i><i>Thomas,</i> 74 F.3d at 682 (\"[W]ithout expert testimony, the average juror is unlikely to understand the significance of drug paraphernalia....\"). The fact that there was no <i>direct</i> evidence that Defendant used the cell phones in the way that Agent Lewis testified is of no consequence. Agent Lewis was not offered to provide percipient testimony directly demonstrating Defendant's actions. Instead, he was providing an opinion, based on extensive training and experience, about the items recovered from the residence and the reasons that they were consistent with drug trafficking. Defendant was free to cross-examine Agent Lewis to demonstrate that there were other legitimate uses for these items. In addition, the jury was instructed that they did not have to accept the opinion testimony and that they should consider how the witness reached his conclusion. Accordingly, we find nothing prejudicial in Agent Lewis's testimony concerning throw-away cellular telephones and conclude there was no error in its admission.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. Investigator Chris Bryant</h2>\n<p>Chris Bryant, an investigator with the narcotics unit of the Knox County Sheriff's Office, testified predominantly regarding the \"controlled buys\" and the execution of the search warrant. He also explained to the jury that items such as scales and plastic sandwich bags are used in the drug trade just as they are in the average household: to weigh and to package things. Defendant argues that the district court erred by allowing Bryant's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*806</span> \"transformation from a fact witness to an opinion witness.\" (Appellant's Br. 12.) Defendant did not object to Bryant's passing comments about these few items of evidence at trial. We review for plain error.</p>\n<p>Although testimony concerning drug dealing is specialized knowledge \"not within the experience of the average juror,\" <i>United States v. Lopez-Medina,</i> 461 F.3d 724, 742 (6th Cir.2006), we are hard-pressed to declare ourselves convinced that Bryant's testimony concerning plastic baggies and scales constitutes \"expert testimony\" that must comply with the well-known admissibility requirements. But, for the sake of discussion, we will address it as if it did.</p>\n<p>The admission of this \"expert testimony\" presents two issues; neither warrants reversal. First, in its Rule 16 disclosure, the Government did not provide Defendant with notice that Bryant would comment about plastic baggies and scales. Nonetheless, Defendant was in no way prejudiced by this absence. The Government's Rule 16 disclosure notified Defendant that expert testimony concerning the general practices of drug dealers would be introduced at trial. Defendant thus \"did not suffer any surprise,\" a point underscored by his attorney's silence as Bryant's brief testimony on these points was heard. <i>United States v. White,</i> 492 F.3d 380, 407 (6th Cir.2007) (quoting <i>United States v. Tarwater,</i> 308 F.3d 494, 515 (6th Cir. 2002)). More fundamentally, he has failed to show \"how the outcome of the case would have been different\" had he received notice. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Second, when a witness gives both fact and expert testimony, the district court must give \"a `cautionary jury instruction regarding the [witness's] dual witness roles'\" or there must be \"`a clear demarcation between [the witness's] fact testimony and expert opinion testimony.'\" <i>United States v. Smith,</i> 601 F.3d 530, 540 (6th Cir.2010) (quoting <i>Lopez-Medina,</i> 461 F.3d at 745). The district court did not give a dual-witness instruction and there was not a clear demarcation between the fact and expert testimony. Even so, Defendant cannot show that this error \"affected substantial rights\" and \"seriously affected the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>Id.</i> at 541 (quoting <i>United States v. Jones,</i> 108 F.3d 668, 670 (6th Cir.1997)). The district court's instruction, which told the jurors that they could reject the opinions given and that they should consider how the witnesses reached their conclusions, was adequate to \"guard against the risk of confusion inherent when a law enforcement agent testifies as both a fact witness and as an expert witness.\" <i>Lopez-Medina,</i> 461 F.3d at 744. Moreover, there were no other evidentiary errors in this case. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Vasquez,</i> 560 F.3d 461, 470-71 (6th Cir.2009) (noting that \"we have declined to extend the holding in <i>Lopez-Medina</i> to circumstances in which there were no other evidentiary errors\"). And in light of the other substantial evidence of Defendant's guilt in this case, particularly the distribution quantities of crack cocaine discovered at Defendant's feet in the closet, Investigator Bryant's \"dual testimony here is insufficient to `show [] an actual effect on the outcome of the case.'\" <i>United States v. Martin,</i> 520 F.3d 656, 660 (6th Cir.2008) (quoting <i>Lopez-Medina,</i> 461 F.3d at 745) (alteration in original). Defendant has not shown that he is entitled to a reversal of his conviction.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>4. Jabari Sheffield's Crack Cocaine Complaint and Judgment</h2>\n<p>Defendant alleges that the district court erred by refusing to admit into evidence a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*807</span> complaint against Jabari Sheffield for possession of 9.6 grams of crack cocaine for resale and a judgment showing her subsequent guilty plea to simple possession of cocaine. The complaint states that officers recovered the crack cocaine from Sheffield on Bonnyman near Oldham, on June 2, 2007. The district court sustained the Government's objection, concluding that the exhibit could not be introduced for impeachment purposes under Federal Rule of Evidence 609 because Sheffield was not testifying and that the exhibit was not relevant to whether Defendant was guilty of the crimes charged. Defendant argues that this was error because the trial court should have analyzed the admissibility under Federal Rule of Evidence 803(8)(C) and 804(b)(3).</p>\n<p>Defendant's argument misses the mark. The evidence was not excluded because it was hearsay, and it does not matter whether an exception to the hearsay rule might apply.</p>\n<p>Nor do we find that the district court abused its discretion in sustaining the Government's objection to evidence that was not relevant. The evidence suggesting that Sheffield was dealing drugs at another location does not bear on any fact of consequence in this case. Sheffield's potential involvement in drug trafficking activitiesothers or those implicated in this casedoes not make the question of Defendant's guilt more or less likely. Indeed, the Government was not required to prove that it was Defendant, to the exclusion of all others, who possessed the drugs and firearms in this case. Even if Sheffield jointly possessed the guns and drugs at 1537 Virginia Avenue, Defendant could still be found guilty. <i>United States v. Gibbs,</i> 182 F.3d 408, 425 (6th Cir.1999) (citing <i>United States v. Craven,</i> 478 F.2d 1329, 1333 (6th Cir.1973)). The district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to admit the evidence regarding Jabari Sheffield's crack cocaine charge and guilty plea.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>5. Stolen Firearm</h2>\n<p>Special Agent Rebecca Bobich testified that the .380-caliber pistol recovered from the bedroom closet was reported stolen in Knox County on October 21, 2006. Defendant argues that this evidence was not relevant to any of the offenses charged in this case. Defendant is mistaken. The legality of the possession of a firearm is a factor to consider in determining whether the firearm was possessed in furtherance of a drug trafficking offense. <i>United States v. Mackey,</i> 265 F.3d 457, 462 (6th Cir.2001). Any prejudice to Defendant was minimized by the district court instructing the jury, twice, that Defendant was on trial only for the crimes charged in the indictment. R. 42 at 128, 143. There was no error in the admission of Special Agent Bobich's testimony.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Sufficiency of the Evidence</h2>\n<p>This Court reviews <i>de novo</i> a defendant's claim of insufficiency of the evidence. <i>United States v. Gunter,</i> 551 F.3d 472, 482 (6th Cir.2009). \"In reviewing challenges regarding the sufficiency of the evidence presented to the jury, we are limited to ascertaining whether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, `<i>any</i> rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.'\" <i>United States v. Carmichael,</i> 232 F.3d 510, 519 (6th Cir.2000) (quoting <i>Jackson v. Virginia,</i> 443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979)).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Possession of Cocaine Base with Intent to Distribute</h2>\n<p>\"To establish a violation of § 841(a)(1), the government must prove <span class=\"star-pagination\">*808</span> the following elements: `(1) knowing (2) possession of a controlled substance (3) with intent to distribute.'\" <i>Mackey,</i> 265 F.3d at 460 (quoting <i>United States v. Christian,</i> 786 F.2d 203, 210 (6th Cir. 1986)).</p>\n<p>Defendant argues that, aside from Agent Lewis's testimony that the crack was packaged for distribution and was \"way too much for personal use\" and Investigator Bryant's testimony regarding the scales and baggies, there was insufficient evidence that Defendant possessed the crack with intent to distribute. Contrary to Defendant's argument, \"<i>all of the evidence</i> is to be considered\" when reviewing for sufficiency of the evidence. <i>Jackson,</i> 443 U.S. at 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781. As discussed above, the admission of Agent Lewis's testimony was not error. Therefore, there is no reason to set aside Agent Lewis's testimony about how the drugs were arranged for distribution in three-gram packages, worth $150 to $200 a piece, and that 37.4 grams, representing a minimum of 370 doses, is too much for personal use. This is competent evidence that well supports the jury's verdict.</p>\n<p>Additional evidence also supported the conviction. Investigator Bryant testified that the confidential informant made a series of controlled buys from a person he referred to as \"Ace\" at 1537 Virginia Avenue. Defendant sports an \"Ace of Spades\" tattoo, and was within a locked bedroom at that Virginia Avenue address. Defendant's plan to avoid apprehension was to hide in the closet with more than 37 grams of crack cocaine at his feet. Any reasonable jury could have concluded that Defendant was the same \"Ace\" who was selling drugs to the confidential informant. We wonder what jury would <i>not</i> reach that conclusion. Moreover, the jury could have inferred solely from the possession of this large quantity of drugs that Defendant intended to further distribute it. <i>United States v. Haywood,</i> 280 F.3d 715, 724 (6th Cir.2002) (18 grams of crack cocaine sufficient for an inference of intent to distribute); <i>United States v. Clemons,</i> 9 Fed. Appx. 286, 289 (6th Cir.2001) (8.5 grams of crack cocaine \"was large enough to draw an inference of intent to distribute\"). In addition, Investigator Bryant testified that firearms were recovered nearby the drugs, $1,008 was recovered from the bedroom, and no drug paraphernalia to use the crack was recovered. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Wilson,</i> 27 F.3d 1126, 1133 (6th Cir.1994) (recognizing \"the connection between guns and drug trafficking\"); <i>United States v. Collier,</i> 246 Fed.Appx. 321, 330 (6th Cir. 2007) (recovery of $1,900 from the defendant's pocket supported conclusion that the defendant was selling drugs). The evidence presented was more than sufficient to support the jury's finding, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Defendant was guilty of possessing crack with intent to distribute.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Possession of a Firearm in Furtherance of a Drug Trafficking Offense</h2>\n<p>Under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c), any person \"who, in furtherance of [a drug trafficking] crime, possesses a firearm, shall, in addition to the punishment provided for [the] drug trafficking crime(i) be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 5 years.\" 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A)(i). To prove the possession was \"in furtherance of\" the drug trafficking crime, the Government must show a \"specific nexus between the gun and the crime charged\" and that the firearm \"was strategically located so that it is quickly and easily available for use.\" <i>Mackey,</i> 265 F.3d at 462. Other factors to consider include: (1) \"whether the gun was loaded,\" (2) \"the type of weapon,\" (3) \"the legality of its possession,\" (4) \"the type of drug <span class=\"star-pagination\">*809</span> activity conducted,\" and (5) \"the time and circumstances under which the firearm was found.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>We applied the <i>Mackey</i> factors in <i>Swafford</i> and concluded that each of the factors supported the conclusion that the defendant possessed the firearm \"in furtherance of\" the drug offenses. <i>Swafford,</i> 385 F.3d at 1029. There, the firearm was a loaded semiautomatic pistol found within arm's reach of where the defendant was lying. <i>Id.</i> A DEA Agent testified that these weapons \"play a role in drug distribution, as dealers carry them for protection and intimidation purposes.\" <i>Id.</i> The defendant was a convicted felon and could not lawfully possess the gun. <i>Id.</i> Also, \"the gun was discovered as the officers executed a search warrant looking for drugs, which they ultimately found.\" <i>Id.</i> Even though the drugs were not found in the same room as the gun, we concluded that the evidence was sufficient to support the defendant's conviction. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Application of the factors from <i>Mackey</i> leads us to the same conclusion. The loaded 9 mm pistol in this case was located about head-high on top of an armoire situated just outside the closet where the drugs were found. It was \"strategically located so that it [was] quickly and easily available for use.\" <i>Mackey,</i> 265 F.3d at 462. Similar to the DEA Agent's testimony in <i>Swafford,</i> Agent Lewis testified that persons involved in drug trafficking almost always have guns because \"[i]t's an illegal business, and the only way they can protect this illegal business is through violence or the threat of violence.\" R. 42 at 77. Like <i>Swafford,</i> Defendant could not lawfully possess a handgun because he was a convicted felon. <i>Swafford,</i> 385 F.3d at 1029. Also, as in <i>Swafford,</i> \"the gun was discovered as the officers executed a search warrant looking for drugs, which they ultimately found.\" <i>Id.</i> The nexus between the offense and gun is even stronger than in <i>Swafford</i> because the gun was found in closer proximity to the drugs, i.e., in the same room. We conclude that a rational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Defendant possessed a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking offense.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. District Court's Instructions</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Failure to Give a Cautionary Instruction</h2>\n<p>Defendant argues that the district court's failure to give a cautionary instruction following Agent Lewis's testimony was plain error. This Court addressed a similar challenge to a district court's failure to give a cautionary instruction following Agent Lewis's testimony in <i>Alford.</i> 332 Fed.Appx. at 282. We found no plain error because, when the district court charged the jury the morning after the one-day trial, it gave a cautionary instruction on opinion testimony that was the same as the instruction in <i>Swafford. Id.</i> at 282-83.</p>\n<p>The district court here gave a cautionary jury instruction regarding opinion testimony that was very similar to the charge given in <i>Swafford.</i> 385 F.3d at 1030 n. 4. In addition, the district court gave a general instruction about weighing witness testimony. These instructions were given mere hours after Agent Lewis testified. Accordingly, we find no plain error in the district court's failure to also instruct the jury immediately following Agent Lewis's testimony.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Burden of Proof</h2>\n<p>Defendant takes issue with the district court's instruction to the jury during <i>voire dire</i> that \"the burden of proof is on the government until the very end of this case.\" R. 41 at 13. Defendant acknowledges that the district court gave an accurate <span class=\"star-pagination\">*810</span> instruction after the close of evidence, and that he did not object to the court's language during <i>voir dire,</i> but argues that the instruction constituted plain error because it implied the burden might shift to Defendant.</p>\n<p>\"This court reviews jury instructions <i>as a whole</i> to determine whether they fairly and adequately inform the jury of relevant considerations and explain the applicable law to assist the jury in reaching its decision.\" <i>United States v. Prince,</i> 214 F.3d 740, 760-61 (6th Cir.2000) (citing <i>United States v. Layne,</i> 192 F.3d 556, 574 (6th Cir.1999); <i>United States v. Harrod,</i> 168 F.3d 887, 890 (6th Cir.1999)) (emphasis added). Reversal is warranted \"only if the instructions, viewed as a whole, were confusing, misleading, or prejudicial.\" <i>Id.</i> (citation and internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p>The challenged instruction does not suggest a burden shift, and is not improper as stated. We believe that a jury would think of \"the very end of this case\" as that time when they have rendered a verdict and their service has ended.</p>\n<p>In addition, even if the instruction were seen, standing alone, as implying a burden shift, the court extensively instructed the jury that it was always the Government's burden to prove Defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. There is no risk of confusion or misconception to be found here.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. Prosecutorial Misconduct</h2>\n<p>\"When we review claims of prosecutorial misconduct, we determine whether the prosecutor's statements were both improper and flagrant.\" <i>United States v. Davis,</i> 514 F.3d 596, 613 (6th Cir.2008). Flagrancy is evaluated based on four factors: \"(1) the likelihood that the remarks of the prosecutor tended to mislead the jury or prejudice the defendant; (2) whether the remarks were isolated or extensive; (3) whether the remarks were deliberately or accidentally made; and (4) the total strength of the evidence against the defendant.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Broom v. Mitchell,</i> 441 F.3d 392, 412 (6th Cir.2006)). Inappropriate but isolated statements do not warrant a new trial. The prosecutorial misconduct must have been \"so pronounced and persistent that it permeate[d] the entire atmosphere of the trial.\" <i>United States v. Bond,</i> 22 F.3d 662, 667 (6th Cir.1994) (quoting <i>United States v. Payne,</i> 2 F.3d 706, 712 (6th Cir.1993)).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Opening Statements</h2>\n<p>Defendant arguesbrieflythat he was prejudiced by the Government stating during its opening statement that \"on the armoire was some marijuana and some pills.\" Defendant stated no objection then, but argues now that the statement was irrelevant to the charges against him and no evidence concerning marijuana and pills was introduced at trial.</p>\n<p>\"Prosecutors should put forth only `proper arguments based on the evidence in the record.'\" <i>Davis,</i> 514 F.3d at 613 (quoting <i>Broom,</i> 441 F.3d at 412). \"The purpose of the opening statement of the prosecution is to outline broadly the facts of the case so that the jury will understand the evidence as it unfolds.\" <i>United States v. Signer,</i> 482 F.2d 394, 399 (6th Cir.1973).</p>\n<p>The prosecutor's opening statement, to the extent that it referred briefly to \"marijuana and pills\" purportedly found during the search was not later supported by testimony. But we find no basis to conclude that the statement was flagrant, even though it was, by one measure or another, a mistake. It was an isolated remark and, given that the specifics of the search warrant execution would be a focus of the trial, there is no indication that it <span class=\"star-pagination\">*811</span> was a deliberate attempt to inject inflammatory or damning \"evidence\" that was never to be introduced. Moreover, the district court instructed the jury twice that the statements and arguments of attorneys are not evidence. R. 41 at 68; R. 42 at 123. The prosecutor's fleeting reference to \"pills\" and \"marijuana\" was, in this case, of no more import than a few stray raindrops in a shower. It was in no way \"so pronounced and persistent that it permeate[d] the entire atmosphere of the trial.\" <i>Bond,</i> 22 F.3d at 667. Accordingly, we find no reversible error.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Closing Arguments</h2>\n<p>Defendant argues that the Government improperly referred to the names of his prior convictionspossession of cocaine with intent to sell and possession of a handgun by a felonduring its closing argument.<sup>[1]</sup> The Government referred to the names a total of four timestwice during its initial closing argument and twice during its rebuttal.</p>\n<p>Three of the instances are clearly in reference to the proper argument that Defendant is a convicted felon, an element of the crime of being a felon in possession of a firearm. Defendant cites no authority precluding the Government from referring to properly admitted evidence that is essential to the Government's case-in-chief during closing arguments. Although statements that are permissible in isolation may, in aggregate, demonstrate an improper purpose, we find no evidence of an improper purpose in this case.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, the fourth instance, in which the Government appeals to the jury's \"common sense,\" comes close to the line. Based on the context, it is unclear whether the Government was suggesting that the jury consider the prior convictions as propensity evidence, evidence of an intent to distribute, or evidence that Defendant was a convicted felon. The reference is sufficiently ambiguous that it is unlikely the jury would view this as an invitation to consider the evidence for an improper purpose. Moreover, the district court gave a limiting instruction explicitly informing the jury that they may consider the prior convictions only as evidence relating to the element of Defendant having been previously convicted of a felony. The general rule is that a jury is presumed to follow the district court's instructions, <i>see </i><i>United States v. Moreno,</i> 933 F.2d 362, 368 (6th Cir.1991), and we see no reason why the jury in this case would have been unable to heed these instructions. Accordingly, we find no plain error.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>E. Sentencing</h2>\n<p>We also consider whether the consecutive component of Defendant's 190-month sentence was proper. Defendant was sentenced <span class=\"star-pagination\">*812</span> to 130 months for possession with intent to distribute cocaine base, 120 months for being a felon in possession of a firearm (to run concurrently with the 130 months), and 60 months for possessing a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking offense. The 60-month consecutive sentence was imposed under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) as the mandatory minimum sentence for possessing a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking offense. Defendant challenges the imposition of this sentence under § 924(c), arguing that it is inconsistent with our decision in <i>United States v. Almany,</i> 598 F.3d 238 (6th Cir.2010), <i>vacated,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 131 S.Ct. 637, ___ L.Ed.2d ___ (2010). After oral argument, the parties submitted supplemental briefs in which they agreed that this sentence runs contrary to <i>Almany</i>'s lesson that the mandatory minimum sentences provided in § 924(c) do not apply to defendants who face longer mandatory sentences under other provisions of law. 598 F.3d at 242. The Government, however, challenged the validity of <i>Almany</i> and requested the court defer decision until the Supreme Court released its decision on the interpretation of § 924(c) in <i>Abbott v. United States,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 131 S.Ct. 18, which was issued on November 15, 2010.</p>\n<p>As in this case, the sentence in <i>Almany</i> included a ten year mandatory sentence for drug trafficking offenses and a five year mandatory sentence for possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A). 598 F.3d at 241. Section 924(c) reads, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<i>Except to the extent that a greater minimum sentence is otherwise provided by this subsection or by any other provision of law,</i> any person who, ... in furtherance of any such crime, possesses a firearm, shall, in addition the punishment provided for such crime of violence or drug trafficking crime(i) be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 5 years; (ii) if the firearm is brandished, be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 7 years; and (iii) if the firearm is discharged, be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 10 years.</blockquote>\n<p>18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A) (emphasis added). Upon indistinguishable facts, the <i>Almany</i> panel held that the plain language of the statute proscribes application of the five year mandatory minimum sentence together with a longer mandatory minimum sentence. 598 F.3d at 242. Quoting with approval the case of <i>United States v. Whitley,</i> 529 F.3d 150, 156 (2d Cir.2008), the court noted that \"we have repeatedly been instructed to give statutes a literal reading and apply the plain meaning of the words Congress used.\" <i>Almany,</i> 598 F.3d at 242. The court then interpreted the \"except\" clause reference to \"any other provision of law\" to except from the mandatory minimum sentence of § 924(c) those cases where a defendant receives a greater mandatory sentence under any law. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>The Supreme Court's opinion in <i>Abbott,</i> however, held that the language in § 924(c) refers only to other provisions imposing longer mandatory sentences \"for the conduct § 924(c) proscribes, <i>i.e.,</i> possessing a firearm in connection with a predicate crime.\" ___ U.S. ___, 131 S.Ct. 18, 26, 178 L.Ed.2d 348 (2010). Looking to the history of § 924(c) and the structure of the section, the Court in <i>Abbott</i> construed the \"except\" clause to apply only to provisions mandating a more severe sentence for the use of firearms in the commission of a crime. <i>Id.</i> The Court examined the history of the statute, particularly noting the title of the 1998 revision evinced a clear intent \"to throttle the criminal use of guns.\" <i>Id.</i> at 27. Considering the interaction with other statutes, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*813</span> the Court in <i>Abbott</i> emphasized the \"sentencing anomalies\" that would result from a plain reading of the language \"any other provision of law.\" <i>Id.</i> Under a literal interpretation of § 924(c), as in <i>Almany,</i> a defendant facing a five-year mandatory sentence for distributing a small quantity of drugs would face the additional mandatory seven years if he brandished a firearm, whereas a similarly situated defendant who distributed a quantity sufficient to require a ten-year mandatory sentence for distribution would be saved by the \"except\" clause. <i>Id.</i> A more cabined application of the phrase \"any other provision of law\" was determined necessary to \"give[] effect to the statutory language commanding that all § 924(c) offenders shall receive additional punishment for their violation of that provision.\" <i>Id.</i> at 29.</p>\n<p>After deciding <i>Abbott,</i> the Supreme Court granted certiorari and vacated <i>Almany.</i> ___ U.S. ___, 131 S.Ct. 637, ___ L.Ed.2d ___ (2010). Under <i>Abbott,</i> a mandatory minimum sentence under § 924(c) must run consecutively with any mandatory sentences for predicate crimes, as well as for other unrelated crimes. The \"except\" clause in § 924(c) prohibits only the imposition of multiple consecutive mandatory sentences under § 924 for using a firearm in the commission of a violent or drug trafficking crime. 131 S.Ct. at 29. Accordingly, a mandatory seven-year sentence for brandishing a firearm in the commission of certain crimes would be merged into a mandatory ten-year sentence for discharging it, and a mandatory five-year sentence for possessing a firearm in the commission of certain crimes would be merged into a mandatory seven-year sentence for brandishing it. <i>Id.</i> at 23.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Defendant's five-year mandatory sentence under § 924(c) was proper even in view of his ten-year mandatory sentence under § 841. The judgment of conviction of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  The Honorable Robert H. Cleland, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Michigan, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  During oral argument, Defendant clarified that his argument concerning his prior convictions was based on a theory of prosecutorial misconduct. In his brief, Defendant argues that the probative value of the evidence of his prior convictions is substantially outweighed by its prejudicial effect. This argument also fails. The Government was obligated to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Defendant had a previous felony conviction. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Jones,</i> 159 F.3d 969, 978 (6th Cir.1998). Had Defendant offered to stipulate to this element of the offense, it would have been an abuse of discretion for the district court to reject it. <i>Old Chief v. United States,</i> 519 U.S. 172, 174, 117 S.Ct. 644, 136 L.Ed.2d 574 (1997). But he did not. The well-worn <i>Old Chief</i> ball was in Defendant's court, and he either failed or affirmatively decided to not act. The prejudice inhering to a defendant in choosing such a course is potentially substantial, but there can be \"no question\" that the probative value of the evidence of Defendant's prior convictions is not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. <i>United States v. Grimmond,</i> 137 F.3d 823, 833 (4th Cir.1998) (citation omitted).</p>\n\n</div>",

Lloyd, Jr., Law Office of Francis L. Lloyd, Jr., Knoxville, Tennessee, for Appellant. Debra A. Breneman, Hugh B. Ward, Jr., Assistant United States Attorney, Knoxville, Tennessee, for Appellee.</p>\n<p>Before: SILER and SUTTON, Circuit Judges; CLELAND, District Judge.<sup>[*]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>OPINION</h2>\n<p>CLELAND, District Judge.</p>\n<p>Michael Rodney Ham appeals his conviction for possession of cocaine base (\"crack\") with intent to distribute, possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking offense, and being a felon in possession of a firearm. Ham objected to few if any of his issues at trial, but now challenges the admission of certain evidence, the sufficiency of the evidence, the district court's jury instructions, certain statements by the Government in opening statement and closing argument, and his consecutive sentence under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c). We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>The Knox County Sheriff's Office utilized a confidential informant to conduct a series of \"controlled buys\" of crack cocaine from a seller known as \"Ace\" at 1537 Virginia Avenue in Knoxville, Tennessee. Based on these purchases, the Sheriff's Office obtained a search warrant to seize drugs from the premises.</p>\n<p>On September 18, 2007, officers executed the search warrant. The officers knocked and announced their presence; however, no one answered the door. The officers therefore used a ram to forcibly enter the house. Upon entry, the officers <span class=\"star-pagination\">*804</span> encountered Jabari Sheffield, also known as \"Jam,\" and two small children in the living area. In securing the house, officers located a bedroom door that they were unable to open easily.</p>\n<p>The officers forcibly opened the door and found Ham hiding in the bedroom closet. At Ham's feet, on the closet floor, officers recovered 37.4 grams of crack cocaine. Also in the closet was a black case containing ammunition and an unloaded.380-caliber pistol, which had been reported stolen from an individual in Knox County in 2006. On top of an armoire near the closet, approximately head-high, officers located a loaded 9 mm handgun. The officers found and seized $1,008 in cash from Ham's pockets, the bed, the armoire, and a shoebox in the closet. The officers also seized a box of various ammunition, plastic baggies, and a set of digital scales from the bedroom, as well as three cellular telephones from the house. A plate with a razor blade and white residue on it was located in the bathroom.</p>\n<p>Ham was arrested and transported to a detention facility. Upon booking, Ham's tattoosan \"Ace of Spades\" and a daggerwere photographed. Ham was charged with possession with intent to distribute five grams or more of crack, possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime, and being a felon in possession of a firearm.</p>\n<p>A jury convicted Ham of all counts on October 16, 2008. The district court sentenced Ham to an effective term of imprisonment of 190 months, followed by eight years of supervised release. Ham now appeals.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. ANALYSIS</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Evidentiary Issues</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Standard of Review</h2>\n<p>Generally, \"[w]e review the district court's admission or exclusion of evidence for an abuse of discretion.\" <i>United States v. Davis,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1386491\"><a href=\"/opinion/1386491/united-states-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">596</span></a></span>, 611 (6th Cir.2008) (quoting <i>United States v.

However, if the complaining party fails to object in the district court, we review for plain error. <i>United States v. Cowart,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"722435\"><a href=\"/opinion/722435/united-states-v-benny-cowart/\"><span class=\"volume\">90</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">154</span></a></span>, 157 (6th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Agent Dave Lewis</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>a. Relevance and Probative Value</h2>\n<p>Agent Dave Lewis, a special agent with the Drug Enforcement Administration (\"DEA\") for approximately twenty-two years, testified regarding the characteristics of crack cocaine as well as the methods involved in the distribution of the drug. Defendant argues that the district court abused its discretion because it failed to assess the relevance and probative value of Agent Lewis's testimony before he was permitted to testify. Defendant did not raise this specific objection during trial; therefore, we review the district court's decision for plain error.</p>\n<p>We have previously rejected an identical challenge in <i>United States v. Alford,</i> 332 Fed.Appx. 275, 281 (6th Cir.2009), in which the defendant argued that \"the district court's failure to assess the relevancy and probative value of Agent Lewis's testimony prior to its admission was plain error.\" <i>Id.</i> We noted that \"this Court has consistently held that expert testimony by a law enforcement officer about the method of operation of drug dealers is admissible pursuant to Fed.R.Evid. 702,\" <i>id.</i> (citing <i>United States v. Thomas,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"711146\"><a href=\"/opinion/711146/united-states-v-malcolm-earl-thomas/\"><span class=\"volume\">74</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">676</span></a></span>, 682 (6th Cir.1996)), and that \"this Court has deemed Agent Lewis qualified in this area,\" <i>id.</i> (citing <i>United States v. List,</i> 200 Fed.Appx. 535, 545 (6th Cir.2006)). We found no plain error in the admission of Agent Lewis's testimony, determining that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*805</span> it was \"highly relevant and helped the jury in resolving the central issue of whether [the defendant] possessed the crack with intent to distribute.\" <i>Id.</i> at 281-82. There is no reason to reach a different conclusion in this case. The district court properly admitted the expert testimony of Agent Lewis.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>b. Personal Use Quantities</h2>\n<p>Defendant argues that the district court clearly erred by allowing Agent Lewis to testify beyond his area of expertise. Specifically, Defendant contends that Agent Lewis's background and training does not qualify him to testify to the quantities of crack that are consistent with personal use. This argument is without merit. As we stated in <i>Alford,</i> \"[t]his Court routinely allows qualified law enforcement officials to testify that circumstances are consistent with drug distribution rather than personal use.\" <i>Alford,</i> 332 Fed.Appx. at 282 (citing <i>United States v. Swafford,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"788010\"><a href=\"/opinion/788010/united-states-v-larry-swafford/\"><span class=\"volume\">385</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1026</span></a></span>, 1030 (6th Cir.2004) (and cases therein); <i>United States v. Combs,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"786364\"><a href=\"/opinion/786364/united-states-v-leon-combs/\"><span class=\"volume\">369</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">925</span></a></span>, 940 (6th Cir.2004); <i>United States v. Thomas,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"711146\"><a href=\"/opinion/711146/united-states-v-malcolm-earl-thomas/\"><span class=\"volume\">74</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">676</span></a></span>, 682 (6th Cir.1996)). There was no plain error.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>c. Cellular Telephones</h2>\n<p>Defendant also argues that Agent Lewis's testimony concerning \"throw-away\" cellular telephones was beyond the scope of his expertise, irrelevant, and unduly prejudicial. Agent Lewis testified, without objection, that drug traffickers often use throw-away phones because they can be set up with a fictitious name, making them untraceable. Defendant argues that this testimony was improper because there was no evidence in the record that Defendant used any of the three phones in the manner described by Agent Lewis.</p>\n<p>The testimony was within the scope of Agent Lewis's expertise because it concerned a \"method of operation of drug dealers.\" <i>Id.</i> at 281. Agent Lewis's testimony explaining why the items seized from the house were consistent with drug dealing was relevant to the issue of whether Defendant intended to distribute the drugs found with him in the bedroom closet. <i>See </i><i>Thomas,</i> 74 F.3d at 682 (\"[W]ithout expert testimony, the average juror is unlikely to understand the significance of drug paraphernalia....\"). The fact that there was no <i>direct</i> evidence that Defendant used the cell phones in the way that Agent Lewis testified is of no consequence. Agent Lewis was not offered to provide percipient testimony directly demonstrating Defendant's actions. Instead, he was providing an opinion, based on extensive training and experience, about the items recovered from the residence and the reasons that they were consistent with drug trafficking. Defendant was free to cross-examine Agent Lewis to demonstrate that there were other legitimate uses for these items. In addition, the jury was instructed that they did not have to accept the opinion testimony and that they should consider how the witness reached his conclusion. Accordingly, we find nothing prejudicial in Agent Lewis's testimony concerning throw-away cellular telephones and conclude there was no error in its admission.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. Investigator Chris Bryant</h2>\n<p>Chris Bryant, an investigator with the narcotics unit of the Knox County Sheriff's Office, testified predominantly regarding the \"controlled buys\" and the execution of the search warrant. He also explained to the jury that items such as scales and plastic sandwich bags are used in the drug trade just as they are in the average household: to weigh and to package things. Defendant argues that the district court erred by allowing Bryant's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*806</span> \"transformation from a fact witness to an opinion witness.\" (Appellant's Br. 12.) Defendant did not object to Bryant's passing comments about these few items of evidence at trial. We review for plain error.</p>\n<p>Although testimony concerning drug dealing is specialized knowledge \"not within the experience of the average juror,\" <i>United States v. Lopez-Medina,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"795541\"><a href=\"/opinion/795541/united-states-v-luis-lopez-medina/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">724</span></a></span>, 742 (6th Cir.2006), we are hard-pressed to declare ourselves convinced that Bryant's testimony concerning plastic baggies and scales constitutes \"expert testimony\" that must comply with the well-known admissibility requirements. But, for the sake of discussion, we will address it as if it did.</p>\n<p>The admission of this \"expert testimony\" presents two issues; neither warrants reversal. First, in its Rule 16 disclosure, the Government did not provide Defendant with notice that Bryant would comment about plastic baggies and scales. Nonetheless, Defendant was in no way prejudiced by this absence. The Government's Rule 16 disclosure notified Defendant that expert testimony concerning the general practices of drug dealers would be introduced at trial. Defendant thus \"did not suffer any surprise,\" a point underscored by his attorney's silence as Bryant's brief testimony on these points was heard. <i>United States v. White,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1446782\"><a href=\"/opinion/1446782/united-states-v-white/\"><span class=\"volume\">492</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">380</span></a></span>, 407 (6th Cir.2007) (quoting <i>United States v. Tarwater,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"779576\"><a href=\"/opinion/779576/united-states-v-larry-t-tarwater/\"><span class=\"volume\">308</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">494</span></a></span>, 515 (6th Cir. 2002)). More fundamentally, he has failed to show \"how the outcome of the case would have been different\" had he received notice. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Second, when a witness gives both fact and expert testimony, the district court must give \"a `cautionary jury instruction regarding the [witness's] dual witness roles'\" or there must be \"`a clear demarcation between [the witness's] fact testimony and expert opinion testimony.'\" <i>United States v. Smith,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1359\"><a href=\"/opinion/1359/united-states-v-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">601</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">530</span></a></span>, 540 (6th Cir.2010) (quoting <i>Lopez-Medina,</i> 461 F.3d at 745). The district court did not give a dual-witness instruction and there was not a clear demarcation between the fact and expert testimony. Even so, Defendant cannot show that this error \"affected substantial rights\" and \"seriously affected the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>Id.</i> at 541 (quoting <i>United States v. Jones,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"737424\"><a href=\"/opinion/737424/united-states-v-jessie-jones-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span>, 670 (6th Cir.1997)). The district court's instruction, which told the jurors that they could reject the opinions given and that they should consider how the witnesses reached their conclusions, was adequate to \"guard against the risk of confusion inherent when a law enforcement agent testifies as both a fact witness and as an expert witness.\" <i>Lopez-Medina,</i> 461 F.3d at 744. Moreover, there were no other evidentiary errors in this case. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Vasquez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1227477\"><a href=\"/opinion/1227477/united-states-v-vasquez/\"><span class=\"volume\">560</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">461</span></a></span>, 470-71 (6th Cir.2009) (noting that \"we have declined to extend the holding in <i>Lopez-Medina</i> to circumstances in which there were no other evidentiary errors\"). And in light of the other substantial evidence of Defendant's guilt in this case, particularly the distribution quantities of crack cocaine discovered at Defendant's feet in the closet, Investigator Bryant's \"dual testimony here is insufficient to `show [] an actual effect on the outcome of the case.'\" <i>United States v. Martin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1201073\"><a href=\"/opinion/1201073/united-states-v-martin/\"><span class=\"volume\">520</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">656</span></a></span>, 660 (6th Cir.2008) (quoting <i>Lopez-Medina,</i> 461 F.3d at 745) (alteration in original). Defendant has not shown that he is entitled to a reversal of his conviction.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>4. Jabari Sheffield's Crack Cocaine Complaint and Judgment</h2>\n<p>Defendant alleges that the district court erred by refusing to admit into evidence a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*807</span> complaint against Jabari Sheffield for possession of 9.6 grams of crack cocaine for resale and a judgment showing her subsequent guilty plea to simple possession of cocaine. The complaint states that officers recovered the crack cocaine from Sheffield on Bonnyman near Oldham, on June 2, 2007. The district court sustained the Government's objection, concluding that the exhibit could not be introduced for impeachment purposes under Federal Rule of Evidence 609 because Sheffield was not testifying and that the exhibit was not relevant to whether Defendant was guilty of the crimes charged. Defendant argues that this was error because the trial court should have analyzed the admissibility under Federal Rule of Evidence 803(8)(C) and 804(b)(3).</p>\n<p>Defendant's argument misses the mark. The evidence was not excluded because it was hearsay, and it does not matter whether an exception to the hearsay rule might apply.</p>\n<p>Nor do we find that the district court abused its discretion in sustaining the Government's objection to evidence that was not relevant. The evidence suggesting that Sheffield was dealing drugs at another location does not bear on any fact of consequence in this case. Sheffield's potential involvement in drug trafficking activitiesothers or those implicated in this casedoes not make the question of Defendant's guilt more or less likely. Indeed, the Government was not required to prove that it was Defendant, to the exclusion of all others, who possessed the drugs and firearms in this case. Even if Sheffield jointly possessed the guns and drugs at 1537 Virginia Avenue, Defendant could still be found guilty. <i>United States v. Gibbs,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765016\"><a href=\"/opinion/765016/united-states-v-anthony-gibbs-96-3383-richard-hough-96-3384-donneto/\"><span class=\"volume\">182</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">408</span></a></span>, 425 (6th Cir.1999) (citing <i>United States v. Craven,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"311068\"><a href=\"/opinion/311068/united-states-v-james-p-craven/\"><span class=\"volume\">478</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1329</span></a></span>, 1333 (6th Cir.1973)). The district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to admit the evidence regarding Jabari Sheffield's crack cocaine charge and guilty plea.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>5. Stolen Firearm</h2>\n<p>Special Agent Rebecca Bobich testified that the .380-caliber pistol recovered from the bedroom closet was reported stolen in Knox County on October 21, 2006. Defendant argues that this evidence was not relevant to any of the offenses charged in this case. Defendant is mistaken. The legality of the possession of a firearm is a factor to consider in determining whether the firearm was possessed in furtherance of a drug trafficking offense. <i>United States v. Mackey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"774907\"><a href=\"/opinion/774907/united-states-v-pierre-s-mackey/\"><span class=\"volume\">265</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">457</span></a></span>, 462 (6th Cir.2001). Any prejudice to Defendant was minimized by the district court instructing the jury, twice, that Defendant was on trial only for the crimes charged in the indictment. R. 42 at 128, 143. There was no error in the admission of Special Agent Bobich's testimony.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Sufficiency of the Evidence</h2>\n<p>This Court reviews <i>de novo</i> a defendant's claim of insufficiency of the evidence. <i>United States v. Gunter,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1456764\"><a href=\"/opinion/1456764/united-states-v-gunter/\"><span class=\"volume\">551</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">472</span></a></span>, 482 (6th Cir.2009). \"In reviewing challenges regarding the sufficiency of the evidence presented to the jury, we are limited to ascertaining whether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, `<i>any</i> rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.'\" <i>United States v. Carmichael,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"771116\"><a href=\"/opinion/771116/united-states-v-lawrence-ray-carmichael/\"><span class=\"volume\">232</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">510</span></a></span>, 519 (6th Cir.2000) (quoting <i>Jackson v. Virginia,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110138\"><a href=\"/opinion/110138/jackson-v-virginia/\"><span class=\"volume\">443</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">307</span></a></span>, 319, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110138\"><a href=\"/opinion/110138/jackson-v-virginia/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2781</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110138\"><a href=\"/opinion/110138/jackson-v-virginia/\"><span class=\"volume\">61</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">560</span></a></span> (1979)).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Possession of Cocaine Base with Intent to Distribute</h2>\n<p>\"To establish a violation of § 841(a)(1), the government must prove <span class=\"star-pagination\">*808</span> the following elements: `(1) knowing (2) possession of a controlled substance (3) with intent to distribute.'\" <i>Mackey,</i> 265 F.3d at 460 (quoting <i>United States v. Christian,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"466374\"><a href=\"/opinion/466374/united-states-v-harry-christian-84-5843-joe-l-davis-85-500585-5346/\"><span class=\"volume\">786</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">203</span></a></span>, 210 (6th Cir. 1986)).</p>\n<p>Defendant argues that, aside from Agent Lewis's testimony that the crack was packaged for distribution and was \"way too much for personal use\" and Investigator Bryant's testimony regarding the scales and baggies, there was insufficient evidence that Defendant possessed the crack with intent to distribute. Contrary to Defendant's argument, \"<i>all of the evidence</i> is to be considered\" when reviewing for sufficiency of the evidence. <i>Jackson,</i> 443 U.S. at 319, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110138\"><a href=\"/opinion/110138/jackson-v-virginia/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2781</span></a></span>. As discussed above, the admission of Agent Lewis's testimony was not error. Therefore, there is no reason to set aside Agent Lewis's testimony about how the drugs were arranged for distribution in three-gram packages, worth $150 to $200 a piece, and that 37.4 grams, representing a minimum of 370 doses, is too much for personal use. This is competent evidence that well supports the jury's verdict.</p>\n<p>Additional evidence also supported the conviction. Investigator Bryant testified that the confidential informant made a series of controlled buys from a person he referred to as \"Ace\" at 1537 Virginia Avenue. Defendant sports an \"Ace of Spades\" tattoo, and was within a locked bedroom at that Virginia Avenue address. Defendant's plan to avoid apprehension was to hide in the closet with more than 37 grams of crack cocaine at his feet. Any reasonable jury could have concluded that Defendant was the same \"Ace\" who was selling drugs to the confidential informant. We wonder what jury would <i>not</i> reach that conclusion. Moreover, the jury could have inferred solely from the possession of this large quantity of drugs that Defendant intended to further distribute it. <i>United States v. Haywood,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"776552\"><a href=\"/opinion/776552/united-states-v-elmer-j-haywood/\"><span class=\"volume\">280</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">715</span></a></span>, 724 (6th Cir.2002) (18 grams of crack cocaine sufficient for an inference of intent to distribute); <i>United States v. Clemons,</i> 9 Fed. Appx. 286, 289 (6th Cir.2001) (8.5 grams of crack cocaine \"was large enough to draw an inference of intent to distribute\"). In addition, Investigator Bryant testified that firearms were recovered nearby the drugs, $1,008 was recovered from the bedroom, and no drug paraphernalia to use the crack was recovered. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Wilson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"672889\"><a href=\"/opinion/672889/united-states-v-kenneth-k-wilson/\"><span class=\"volume\">27</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1126</span></a></span>, 1133 (6th Cir.1994) (recognizing \"the connection between guns and drug trafficking\"); <i>United States v. Collier,</i> 246 Fed.Appx. 321, 330 (6th Cir. 2007) (recovery of $1,900 from the defendant's pocket supported conclusion that the defendant was selling drugs). The evidence presented was more than sufficient to support the jury's finding, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Defendant was guilty of possessing crack with intent to distribute.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Possession of a Firearm in Furtherance of a Drug Trafficking Offense</h2>\n<p>Under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c), any person \"who, in furtherance of [a drug trafficking] crime, possesses a firearm, shall, in addition to the punishment provided for [the] drug trafficking crime(i) be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 5 years.\" 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A)(i). To prove the possession was \"in furtherance of\" the drug trafficking crime, the Government must show a \"specific nexus between the gun and the crime charged\" and that the firearm \"was strategically located so that it is quickly and easily available for use.\" <i>Mackey,</i> 265 F.3d at 462. Other factors to consider include: (1) \"whether the gun was loaded,\" (2) \"the type of weapon,\" (3) \"the legality of its possession,\" (4) \"the type of drug <span class=\"star-pagination\">*809</span> activity conducted,\" and (5) \"the time and circumstances under which the firearm was found.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>We applied the <i>Mackey</i> factors in <i>Swafford</i> and concluded that each of the factors supported the conclusion that the defendant possessed the firearm \"in furtherance of\" the drug offenses. <i>Swafford,</i> 385 F.3d at 1029. There, the firearm was a loaded semiautomatic pistol found within arm's reach of where the defendant was lying. <i>Id.</i> A DEA Agent testified that these weapons \"play a role in drug distribution, as dealers carry them for protection and intimidation purposes.\" <i>Id.</i> The defendant was a convicted felon and could not lawfully possess the gun. <i>Id.</i> Also, \"the gun was discovered as the officers executed a search warrant looking for drugs, which they ultimately found.\" <i>Id.</i> Even though the drugs were not found in the same room as the gun, we concluded that the evidence was sufficient to support the defendant's conviction. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Application of the factors from <i>Mackey</i> leads us to the same conclusion. The loaded 9 mm pistol in this case was located about head-high on top of an armoire situated just outside the closet where the drugs were found. It was \"strategically located so that it [was] quickly and easily available for use.\" <i>Mackey,</i> 265 F.3d at 462. Similar to the DEA Agent's testimony in <i>Swafford,</i> Agent Lewis testified that persons involved in drug trafficking almost always have guns because \"[i]t's an illegal business, and the only way they can protect this illegal business is through violence or the threat of violence.\" R. 42 at 77. Like <i>Swafford,</i> Defendant could not lawfully possess a handgun because he was a convicted felon. <i>Swafford,</i> 385 F.3d at 1029. Also, as in <i>Swafford,</i> \"the gun was discovered as the officers executed a search warrant looking for drugs, which they ultimately found.\" <i>Id.</i> The nexus between the offense and gun is even stronger than in <i>Swafford</i> because the gun was found in closer proximity to the drugs, i.e., in the same room. We conclude that a rational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Defendant possessed a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking offense.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. District Court's Instructions</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Failure to Give a Cautionary Instruction</h2>\n<p>Defendant argues that the district court's failure to give a cautionary instruction following Agent Lewis's testimony was plain error. This Court addressed a similar challenge to a district court's failure to give a cautionary instruction following Agent Lewis's testimony in <i>Alford.</i> 332 Fed.Appx. at 282. We found no plain error because, when the district court charged the jury the morning after the one-day trial, it gave a cautionary instruction on opinion testimony that was the same as the instruction in <i>Swafford. Id.</i> at 282-83.</p>\n<p>The district court here gave a cautionary jury instruction regarding opinion testimony that was very similar to the charge given in <i>Swafford.</i> 385 F.3d at 1030 n. 4. In addition, the district court gave a general instruction about weighing witness testimony. These instructions were given mere hours after Agent Lewis testified. Accordingly, we find no plain error in the district court's failure to also instruct the jury immediately following Agent Lewis's testimony.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Burden of Proof</h2>\n<p>Defendant takes issue with the district court's instruction to the jury during <i>voire dire</i> that \"the burden of proof is on the government until the very end of this case.\" R. 41 at 13. Defendant acknowledges that the district court gave an accurate <span class=\"star-pagination\">*810</span> instruction after the close of evidence, and that he did not object to the court's language during <i>voir dire,</i> but argues that the instruction constituted plain error because it implied the burden might shift to Defendant.</p>\n<p>\"This court reviews jury instructions <i>as a whole</i> to determine whether they fairly and adequately inform the jury of relevant considerations and explain the applicable law to assist the jury in reaching its decision.\" <i>United States v. Prince,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"768959\"><a href=\"/opinion/768959/united-states-v-john-r-prince-98-6361-tony-white-98-6362/\"><span class=\"volume\">214</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">740</span></a></span>, 760-61 (6th Cir.2000) (citing <i>United States v.

Reversal is warranted \"only if the instructions, viewed as a whole, were confusing, misleading, or prejudicial.\" <i>Id.</i> (citation and internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p>The challenged instruction does not suggest a burden shift, and is not improper as stated. We believe that a jury would think of \"the very end of this case\" as that time when they have rendered a verdict and their service has ended.</p>\n<p>In addition, even if the instruction were seen, standing alone, as implying a burden shift, the court extensively instructed the jury that it was always the Government's burden to prove Defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. There is no risk of confusion or misconception to be found here.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. Prosecutorial Misconduct</h2>\n<p>\"When we review claims of prosecutorial misconduct, we determine whether the prosecutor's statements were both improper and flagrant.\" <i>United States v. Davis,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1386491\"><a href=\"/opinion/1386491/united-states-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">596</span></a></span>, 613 (6th Cir.2008). Flagrancy is evaluated based on four factors: \"(1) the likelihood that the remarks of the prosecutor tended to mislead the jury or prejudice the defendant; (2) whether the remarks were isolated or extensive; (3) whether the remarks were deliberately or accidentally made; and (4) the total strength of the evidence against the defendant.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Broom v. Mitchell,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"793677\"><a href=\"/opinion/793677/romell-broom-v-betty-mitchell/\"><span class=\"volume\">441</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">392</span></a></span>, 412 (6th Cir.2006)). Inappropriate but isolated statements do not warrant a new trial. The prosecutorial misconduct must have been \"so pronounced and persistent that it permeate[d] the entire atmosphere of the trial.\" <i>United States v. Bond,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"668573\"><a href=\"/opinion/668573/united-states-v-dexter-obryant-bond-92-2266-ervin-brown-jr-92-2268/\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">662</span></a></span>, 667 (6th Cir.1994) (quoting <i>United States v. Payne,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"628276\"><a href=\"/opinion/628276/united-states-v-darryl-nichols-payne/\"><span class=\"volume\">2</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">706</span></a></span>, 712 (6th Cir.1993)).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Opening Statements</h2>\n<p>Defendant arguesbrieflythat he was prejudiced by the Government stating during its opening statement that \"on the armoire was some marijuana and some pills.\" Defendant stated no objection then, but argues now that the statement was irrelevant to the charges against him and no evidence concerning marijuana and pills was introduced at trial.</p>\n<p>\"Prosecutors should put forth only `proper arguments based on the evidence in the record.'\" <i>Davis,</i> 514 F.3d at 613 (quoting <i>Broom,</i> 441 F.3d at 412). \"The purpose of the opening statement of the prosecution is to outline broadly the facts of the case so that the jury will understand the evidence as it unfolds.\" <i>United States v. Signer,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"312694\"><a href=\"/opinion/312694/united-states-v-burton-r-signer/\"><span class=\"volume\">482</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">394</span></a></span>, 399 (6th Cir.1973).</p>\n<p>The prosecutor's opening statement, to the extent that it referred briefly to \"marijuana and pills\" purportedly found during the search was not later supported by testimony. But we find no basis to conclude that the statement was flagrant, even though it was, by one measure or another, a mistake. It was an isolated remark and, given that the specifics of the search warrant execution would be a focus of the trial, there is no indication that it <span class=\"star-pagination\">*811</span> was a deliberate attempt to inject inflammatory or damning \"evidence\" that was never to be introduced. Moreover, the district court instructed the jury twice that the statements and arguments of attorneys are not evidence. R. 41 at 68; R. 42 at 123. The prosecutor's fleeting reference to \"pills\" and \"marijuana\" was, in this case, of no more import than a few stray raindrops in a shower. It was in no way \"so pronounced and persistent that it permeate[d] the entire atmosphere of the trial.\" <i>Bond,</i> 22 F.3d at 667. Accordingly, we find no reversible error.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Closing Arguments</h2>\n<p>Defendant argues that the Government improperly referred to the names of his prior convictionspossession of cocaine with intent to sell and possession of a handgun by a felonduring its closing argument.<sup>[1]</sup> The Government referred to the names a total of four timestwice during its initial closing argument and twice during its rebuttal.</p>\n<p>Three of the instances are clearly in reference to the proper argument that Defendant is a convicted felon, an element of the crime of being a felon in possession of a firearm. Defendant cites no authority precluding the Government from referring to properly admitted evidence that is essential to the Government's case-in-chief during closing arguments. Although statements that are permissible in isolation may, in aggregate, demonstrate an improper purpose, we find no evidence of an improper purpose in this case.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, the fourth instance, in which the Government appeals to the jury's \"common sense,\" comes close to the line. Based on the context, it is unclear whether the Government was suggesting that the jury consider the prior convictions as propensity evidence, evidence of an intent to distribute, or evidence that Defendant was a convicted felon. The reference is sufficiently ambiguous that it is unlikely the jury would view this as an invitation to consider the evidence for an improper purpose. Moreover, the district court gave a limiting instruction explicitly informing the jury that they may consider the prior convictions only as evidence relating to the element of Defendant having been previously convicted of a felony. The general rule is that a jury is presumed to follow the district court's instructions, <i>see </i><i>United States v. Moreno,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"561297\"><a href=\"/opinion/561297/united-states-v-isidro-moreno-90-5832-paul-r-morris-90-5867/\"><span class=\"volume\">933</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">362</span></a></span>, 368 (6th Cir.1991), and we see no reason why the jury in this case would have been unable to heed these instructions. Accordingly, we find no plain error.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>E. Sentencing</h2>\n<p>We also consider whether the consecutive component of Defendant's 190-month sentence was proper. Defendant was sentenced <span class=\"star-pagination\">*812</span> to 130 months for possession with intent to distribute cocaine base, 120 months for being a felon in possession of a firearm (to run concurrently with the 130 months), and 60 months for possessing a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking offense. The 60-month consecutive sentence was imposed under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) as the mandatory minimum sentence for possessing a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking offense. Defendant challenges the imposition of this sentence under § 924(c), arguing that it is inconsistent with our decision in <i>United States v. Almany,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1223577\"><a href=\"/opinion/1223577/united-states-v-almany/\"><span class=\"volume\">598</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">238</span></a></span> (6th Cir.2010), <i>vacated,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">131</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">637</span></span>, ___ L.Ed.2d ___ (2010). After oral argument, the parties submitted supplemental briefs in which they agreed that this sentence runs contrary to <i>Almany</i>'s lesson that the mandatory minimum sentences provided in § 924(c) do not apply to defendants who face longer mandatory sentences under other provisions of law. 598 F.3d at 242. The Government, however, challenged the validity of <i>Almany</i> and requested the court defer decision until the Supreme Court released its decision on the interpretation of § 924(c) in <i>Abbott v. United States,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"179213\"><a href=\"/opinion/179213/abbott-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">131</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">18</span></a></span>, which was issued on November 15, 2010.</p>\n<p>As in this case, the sentence in <i>Almany</i> included a ten year mandatory sentence for drug trafficking offenses and a five year mandatory sentence for possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A). 598 F.3d at 241. Section 924(c) reads, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<i>Except to the extent that a greater minimum sentence is otherwise provided by this subsection or by any other provision of law,</i> any person who, ... in furtherance of any such crime, possesses a firearm, shall, in addition the punishment provided for such crime of violence or drug trafficking crime(i) be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 5 years; (ii) if the firearm is brandished, be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 7 years; and (iii) if the firearm is discharged, be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 10 years.</blockquote>\n<p>18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A) (emphasis added). Upon indistinguishable facts, the <i>Almany</i> panel held that the plain language of the statute proscribes application of the five year mandatory minimum sentence together with a longer mandatory minimum sentence. 598 F.3d at 242. Quoting with approval the case of <i>United States v. Whitley,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1455961\"><a href=\"/opinion/1455961/united-states-v-whitley/\"><span class=\"volume\">529</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">150</span></a></span>, 156 (2d Cir.2008), the court noted that \"we have repeatedly been instructed to give statutes a literal reading and apply the plain meaning of the words Congress used.\" <i>Almany,</i> 598 F.3d at 242. The court then interpreted the \"except\" clause reference to \"any other provision of law\" to except from the mandatory minimum sentence of § 924(c) those cases where a defendant receives a greater mandatory sentence under any law. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>The Supreme Court's opinion in <i>Abbott,</i> however, held that the language in § 924(c) refers only to other provisions imposing longer mandatory sentences \"for the conduct § 924(c) proscribes, <i>i.e.,</i> possessing a firearm in connection with a predicate crime.\" ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"179213\"><a href=\"/opinion/179213/abbott-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">131</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">18</span></a></span>, 26, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"179213\"><a href=\"/opinion/179213/abbott-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">178</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">348</span></a></span> (2010). Looking to the history of § 924(c) and the structure of the section, the Court in <i>Abbott</i> construed the \"except\" clause to apply only to provisions mandating a more severe sentence for the use of firearms in the commission of a crime. <i>Id.</i> The Court examined the history of the statute, particularly noting the title of the 1998 revision evinced a clear intent \"to throttle the criminal use of guns.\" <i>Id.</i> at 27. Considering the interaction with other statutes, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*813</span> the Court in <i>Abbott</i> emphasized the \"sentencing anomalies\" that would result from a plain reading of the language \"any other provision of law.\" <i>Id.</i> Under a literal interpretation of § 924(c), as in <i>Almany,</i> a defendant facing a five-year mandatory sentence for distributing a small quantity of drugs would face the additional mandatory seven years if he brandished a firearm, whereas a similarly situated defendant who distributed a quantity sufficient to require a ten-year mandatory sentence for distribution would be saved by the \"except\" clause. <i>Id.</i> A more cabined application of the phrase \"any other provision of law\" was determined necessary to \"give[] effect to the statutory language commanding that all § 924(c) offenders shall receive additional punishment for their violation of that provision.\" <i>Id.</i> at 29.</p>\n<p>After deciding <i>Abbott,</i> the Supreme Court granted certiorari and vacated <i>Almany.</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">131</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">637</span></span>, ___ L.Ed.2d ___ (2010). Under <i>Abbott,</i> a mandatory minimum sentence under § 924(c) must run consecutively with any mandatory sentences for predicate crimes, as well as for other unrelated crimes. The \"except\" clause in § 924(c) prohibits only the imposition of multiple consecutive mandatory sentences under § 924 for using a firearm in the commission of a violent or drug trafficking crime. 131 S.Ct. at 29. Accordingly, a mandatory seven-year sentence for brandishing a firearm in the commission of certain crimes would be merged into a mandatory ten-year sentence for discharging it, and a mandatory five-year sentence for possessing a firearm in the commission of certain crimes would be merged into a mandatory seven-year sentence for brandishing it. <i>Id.</i> at 23.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Defendant's five-year mandatory sentence under § 924(c) was proper even in view of his ten-year mandatory sentence under § 841. The judgment of conviction of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  The Honorable Robert H. Cleland, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Michigan, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  During oral argument, Defendant clarified that his argument concerning his prior convictions was based on a theory of prosecutorial misconduct. In his brief, Defendant argues that the probative value of the evidence of his prior convictions is substantially outweighed by its prejudicial effect. This argument also fails. The Government was obligated to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Defendant had a previous felony conviction. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Jones,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"758827\"><a href=\"/opinion/758827/united-states-v-climmie-jones-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">159</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">969</span></a></span>, 978 (6th Cir.1998). Had Defendant offered to stipulate to this element of the offense, it would have been an abuse of discretion for the district court to reject it. <i>Old Chief v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118074\"><a href=\"/opinion/118074/old-chief-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">519</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">172</span></a></span>, 174, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118074\"><a href=\"/opinion/118074/old-chief-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">644</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118074\"><a href=\"/opinion/118074/old-chief-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">136</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">574</span></a></span> (1997). But he did not. The well-worn <i>Old Chief</i> ball was in Defendant's court, and he either failed or affirmatively decided to not act. The prejudice inhering to a defendant in choosing such a course is potentially substantial, but there can be \"no question\" that the probative value of the evidence of Defendant's prior convictions is not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. <i>United States v. Grimmond,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"751854\"><a href=\"/opinion/751854/united-states-v-brian-s-grimmond/\"><span class=\"volume\">137</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">823</span></a></span>, 833 (4th Cir.1998) (citation omitted).</p>\n\n</div>",
