Grill, OFFICE OF THE FEDERAL PUBLIC DEFENDER,\nToledo, Ohio, for Appellant.\n                                  _________________\n\n                                       OPINION\n                                  _________________\n\n       BOYCE F. MARTIN, JR., Circuit Judge. Kelo McPherson, a federal prisoner\nproceeding through counsel, appeals the judgment of the district court denying his\nmotion to reduce sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2). This case has been\nreferred to a panel of the court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(1), Rules of the Sixth Circuit.\nUpon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed.\nR. App. P. 34(a).\n\n       In 2004, pursuant to a plea agreement, McPherson pleaded guilty to one count\nof possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine, possession with intent to distribute\n\n\n\n                                            1\n\fNo. 10-3232        United States v. McPherson                                      Page 2\n\n\ncocaine, and being a felon in possession of a firearm. A presentence report calculated\nMcPherson’s total offense level as 33 and his criminal history category as IV, resulting\nin an advisory guidelines range of imprisonment of 188 to 235 months. Because a\nstatutorily mandated sentence of 240 months was warranted pursuant to 21 U.S.C.\n§§ 841(b)(1)(A) and 851, however, McPherson’s advisory guidelines range of\nimprisonment became 240 months. See USSG § 5G1.1(b).\n\n       At sentencing, the district court granted the government’s motion for substantial\nassistance under USSG § 5K1.1. The district court sentenced McPherson to a term of\nimprisonment of 168 months based on a total offense level of 32 and a criminal history\ncategory of IV.\n\n       In December 2009, McPherson filed the instant motion to reduce sentence\npursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2), arguing that Amendment 706, which reduced offense\nlevels for convictions for cocaine base, should reduce his offense level from 32 to 30.\nThe district court denied the motion, however, finding that McPherson was not eligible\nfor a sentence reduction because his sentence was based on the mandatory minimum\nsentence of 240 months.\n\n       McPherson now appeals. On appeal, McPherson’s counsel has filed a motion\nand brief in compliance with Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738, 744 (1967), and Rule\n101(f)(3), Rules of the Sixth Circuit, averring that she has fully examined the record and\nwishes to withdraw due to a lack of good faith issues to appeal. Despite this conclusion,\ncounsel has raised the issue of whether the trial court erred in denying McPherson’s\nmotion to modify his sentence. Because counsel has filed an adequate Anders brief, and\nour own independent review of the record, pursuant to Penson v. Ohio, 488 U.S. 75, 82-\n83 (1988), reveals no arguable issues sufficient to sustain the appeal, we grant counsel’s\nmotion to withdraw.\n\n       When considering McPherson’s motion to modify sentence, the district court was\nlimited to consideration of the retroactive effect of Amendment 706. Section 3582(c)(2)\n“authorize[s] only a limited adjustment to an otherwise final sentence and not a plenary\nresentencing proceeding.” Dillon v. United States, __ U.S. __, 130 S. Ct. 2683, 2691\n\fNo. 10-3232        United States v. McPherson                                       Page 3\n\n\n(2010). Accordingly, the only cognizable issue is whether the district court erred in\ndenying the motion. United States v. Perdue, 572 F.3d 288, 290 (6th Cir. 2009).\n\n       Section 3582(c)(2) allows a sentence modification “in the case of a defendant\nwho has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has\nsubsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission . . . after considering the\nfactors set forth in [18 U.S.C.] section 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable, if\nsuch a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing\nCommission.” 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2); see also USSG § 1B1.10(a). “A reduction in the\ndefendant’s term of imprisonment is not consistent . . . [if] . . . [a]n amendment [to the\nGuidelines] does not have the effect of lowering the defendant’s applicable guideline\nrange.” United States v. Pembrook, 609 F.3d 381, 383 (6th Cir. 2010) (citation omitted).\n\n       In United States v. Johnson, 564 F.3d 419, 423 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 130 S. Ct.\n318 (2009), we held that a defendant subject to a statutory mandatory minimum\nsentence is not eligible for a reduction under § 3582(c)(2) because Amendment 706 does\nnot lower the defendant’s applicable guideline range. In Johnson, the defendant’s crack\ncocaine guideline range was 235 to 293 months but, because he was subject to a\nmandatory minimum sentence of 240 months, his guideline range became 240 to 293\nmonths. Id. at 420-21. Following the grant of a USSG § 5K1.1 motion by the\ngovernment, the district court imposed a 108-month sentence. Id. at 421. Johnson later\nfiled a § 3582(c)(2) motion to reduce sentence, based on Amendment 706, which the\ndistrict court denied. Id. at 421. We affirmed, holding that Johnson “was not in fact\nsentenced based on a Guidelines range that was subsequently reduced. Rather, his\nsentence was based on the [240-month] mandatory minimum imposed by 21 U.S.C.\n§ 841(b)(1)(A), which remained unchanged by Guidelines Amendment 706.” Id. at 423.\n\n       Here, McPherson’s sentence was not based on a guidelines range that was\nsubsequently reduced. Like the defendant in Johnson, it was based on the 240-month\nminimum sentence mandated by statute. Because Amendment 706 did not lower the\nstatutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment, McPherson was not eligible for a\n\fNo. 10-3232        United States v. McPherson                                      Page 4\n\n\nsentence reduction pursuant to § 3582(c)(2), and the district court did not err by denying\nMcPherson’s motion.\n\n       An independent review of the record reveals no other issue that would support\nan appeal. Counsel’s motion to withdraw is, therefore, granted. The judgment of the\ndistrict court is affirmed. Rule 34(j)(2)(C), Rules of the Sixth Circuit.\n\f",

Johnson later filed a § 3582(c)(2) motion to reduce sentence, based on Amendment 706, which the district court denied. <i>Id.</i> at 421. We affirmed, holding that Johnson \"was not in fact sentenced based on a Guidelines range that was subsequently reduced. Rather, his sentence was based on the [240-month] mandatory minimum imposed by 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A), which remained unchanged by Guidelines Amendment 706.\" <i>Id.</i> at 423.</p>\n<p>Here, McPherson's sentence was not based on a guidelines range that was subsequently reduced. Like the defendant in <i>Johnson,</i> it was based on the 240-month minimum sentence mandated by statute. Because Amendment 706 did not lower the statutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment, McPherson was not eligible <span class=\"star-pagination\">*612</span> for a sentence reduction pursuant to § 3582(c)(2), and the district court did not err by denying McPherson's motion.</p>\n<p>An independent review of the record reveals no other issue that would support an appeal. Counsel's motion to withdraw is, therefore, granted. The judgment of the district court is affirmed. Rule 34(j)(2)(C), Rules of the Sixth Circuit.</p>\n</div>",
