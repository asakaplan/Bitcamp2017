Petitioner Michael Anthony Williams, a state inmate\nproceeding pro se, appeals the sua sponte dismissal of his Complaint against Respondent\nofficials at the Oaks Correctional Facility (“Respondents”) for failure to state a claim\nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983. For the reasons stated below, we REVERSE the decision of\nthe district court and REMAND for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                           1\n\fNo. 09-1381             Williams v. Curtin, et al.                                                    Page 2\n\n\n                                           BACKGROUND\n\n         All facts are taken from the Complaint, since those were the facts available to the\ndistrict court. Petitioner alleges that, on or about October 25, 2007, he “was subject to\nCruel and Unusual Punishment” when prison officers used a “chemical agent to disable\nhim and gain his compliance.” According to the Complaint, prison officials sought to\ntransfer Petitioner from Housing Unit No. 3 to Unit No. 5, both of which are\nadministrative segregation units at the Oaks Correctional Facility.\n\n         Petitioner alleges that upon being ordered to “pack up” his cell, Petitioner\nresponded: “What for, sir?” At that point, an officer stated, “ARUS Hernandez, order\nyou [sic] to leave this cellblock.” Respondent Pant then entered the cellblock with an\n“assault squad,” organized pursuant to an order by Respondent Curley, and released a\n“chemical agent.” This caused Petitioner “to cough” and resulted in a “shortage of\noxygen.”\n\n         Following Petitioner’s unsuccessful attempts at relief through the internal prison\ngrievance process,1 Petitioner filed this instant § 1983 action on May 21, 2008. Upon\nan initial screening of the Complaint pursuant to the Prison Litigation Reform Act, as\namended, 42 U.S.C. § 1997e et seq., the assigned magistrate judge filed a report and\nrecommendation (“R&R”) that recommended dismissal for failure to state a claim.\nPetitioner filed objections to the R&R that contained factual allegations not contained\nin the Complaint. The district court refused to consider the new allegations, and adopted\nthe R&R on June 19, 2008 as the decision of the district court. Petitioner now appeals.\n\n\n\n\n         1\n           Petitioner has annexed to his Complaint numerous records relating to his grievances. On or\nabout November 14, 2007, Petitioner filed a Step-I grievance with the prison, making the same allegations\nas he does in this litigation. This grievance was dismissed on the merits. At Step-II, Petitioner sought\n“reimbursement for lost [sic] of legal materials and medical doctrines,” but the grievance was dismissed\nbecause Petitioner failed to first raise this issue at Step-I. Petitioner then pursued his initial grievance to\nStep-III. Upon review, the prison found that Petitioner’s grievance was properly handled below, and that\nPetitioner had not produced sufficient evidence to demonstrate a violation of prison policies.\n\fNo. 09-1381          Williams v. Curtin, et al.                                        Page 3\n\n\n                                       DISCUSSION\n\n         The district court appears to have relied upon two grounds to dismiss the\nComplaint. First, the district court found that Petitioner’s alleged injuries were “de\nminimus [sic].” Second, the district court found that Respondents’ conduct was\nreasonable, stating that the chemical agent “was applied in a good-faith effort to\nmaintain or restore discipline, not to maliciously or to sadistically cause harm.” The\ndistrict court further reasoned that Petitioner admitted that he was “noncompliant[] with\n[Respondents’] orders.”\n\n         On appeal, Petitioner asserts that the district court erred by: 1) incorrectly stating\nthat Petitioner disobeyed an order just prior to the use of chemical spray; and\n2) misapplying the proper legal standards. We agree.\n\n         A.      Standard of Review: Dismissal for Failure to State a Claim\n\n         This Court reviews de novo a district court’s dismissal of a complaint for failure\nto state a claim. See, e.g., Thomas v. Eby, 481 F.3d 434, 437 (6th Cir. 2007). Accepting\nall well-pleaded allegations in the complaint as true, the Court “consider[s] the factual\nallegations in [the] complaint to determine if they plausibly suggest an entitlement to\nrelief.” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 1951 (2009). Pro se complaints are to be\nheld “to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers,” and should\ntherefore be liberally construed. See Martin v. Overton, 391 F.3d 710, 712 (6th Cir.\n2004).\n\n         B.      Legal Standard: Eighth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution\n\n         The district court properly characterized Petitioner’s claim as arising under the\nEighth Amendment. See, e.g., Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386, 394 (1989); Combs v.\nWilkinson, 315 F.3d 548, 556 (6th Cir. 2002). The Eighth Amendment proscribes the\nunnecessary and wanton infliction of pain against prisoners. See, e.g., Whitley v. Albers,\n475 U.S. 312, 319 (1986). Although prison discipline may require that inmates endure\nrelatively greater physical contact, the Eighth Amendment is nonetheless violated if the\n“offending conduct reflects an unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain.” Pelfrey v.\n\fNo. 09-1381         Williams v. Curtin, et al.                                         Page 4\n\n\nChambers, 43 F.3d 1034, 1037 (6th Cir. 1995) (internal alterations and quotation marks\nomitted). To make out a claim under the Eighth Amendment, the prisoner must satisfy\nboth an objective and a subjective component. See, e.g., Moore v. Holbrook, 2 F.3d 697,\n700 (6th Cir. 1993).\n\n        The subjective component focuses on the state of mind of the prison officials.\nThe relevant inquiry is “whether force was applied in a good faith effort to maintain or\nrestore discipline or maliciously and sadistically for the very purpose of causing harm.”\nHudson v. McMillian, 503 U.S. 1, 6 (1992) (internal quotation marks omitted). Courts\nmay consider “the need for the application of force, the relationship between the need\nand the amount of force that was used, and the extent of injury inflicted.” Whitley,\n475 U.S. at 321. Courts may also consider the circumstances “as reasonably perceived\nby the responsible officials on the basis of the facts known to them, and any efforts made\nto temper the severity of a forceful response.” Id.\n\n        The objective component requires the pain inflicted to be “sufficiently serious.”\nWilson v. Seiter, 501 U.S. 294, 298 (1991). This is a “contextual” inquiry that is\n“responsive to contemporary standards of decency.” Hudson, 503 U.S. at 8-9 (internal\ncitation and quotation marks omitted).           The seriousness of the injuries are not\ndispositive; as the Supreme Court has held, “[w]hen prison officials maliciously and\nsadistically use force to cause harm, contemporary standards of decency always are\nviolated . . . whether or not significant injury is evident.” Id. at 9; see also Wilkins v.\nGaddy, 130 S. Ct. 1175, 1178 (2010) (per curiam).\n\n        C.      Application:       Complaint States a Claim Under the Eighth\n                Amendment\n        The district court erred in concluding that the Complaint fails to state a claim.\nGiving due regard to Petitioner’s status as a pro se litigant, we find that the Complaint\ncontains sufficient factual averments that, if true, “state a claim to relief that is plausible\non its face” under the Eighth Amendment. See Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S.\n544, 570 (2007).\n\fNo. 09-1381           Williams v. Curtin, et al.                                                 Page 5\n\n\n         With regard to the subjective component of an Eighth Amendment claim,\nPetitioner has sufficiently alleged that Respondents acted with a culpable state of mind.\nContrary to the statements of the district court, Petitioner does not admit that he\ndisobeyed a direct order.2 Petitioner alleges that, when instructed to “pack up,” he\ninquired, “What for, sir?,” at which point an “assault team” entered the cell and used a\nchemical agent on him. These facts, if true, may permit a finding that the use and/or\namount of force was unnecessary, which may suggest that Respondents’ actions were\nnot taken in good faith and were perhaps motivated by the malicious purpose of causing\nharm.\n\n         Likewise, with regard to the objective component of an Eighth Amendment\nclaim, Petitioner has sufficiently alleged that Respondents inflicted “sufficiently serious”\npain. Although the district court found that Petitioner’s allegations of injury—namely,\ncoughing and shortage of oxygen—constitute a “de minimus [sic] injury,” this finding\nis an insufficient basis upon which to dismiss the Complaint. See Wilkins, 130 S. Ct. at\n1178. If it were a sufficient basis, as the Supreme Court has explained, “the Eighth\nAmendment would permit any physical punishment, no matter how diabolic or inhuman,\ninflicting less than some arbitrary quantity of injury.” Hudson, 503 U.S. at 9. Indeed,\nthe Supreme Court recently reversed a sua sponte dismissal of a prisoner’s Eighth\nAmendment claim, where the lower court did so on the basis of de minimis injury. See\nWilkins, 130 S. Ct. at 1178-80. The Court rejected the argument that the Eighth\nAmendment requires a showing of significant injury, holding instead that the judicial\ninquiry should focus on “the nature of the force rather than the extent of the injury.” Id.\nat 1177.\n\n\n\n\n         2\n           The evidence that Petitioner disobeyed an order appears to come from a prison grievance report\nannexed to the Complaint that states as follows: “Prisoner Williams was interviewed and admits to\nrefusing the orders, admits to blocking his cell door, and admits he was not injured in the forced cell\nmove.” (Compl., Ex. 1 at 5.) Although the district court may consider exhibits to the Complaint,\nPetitioner does not make such an admission in his actual Complaint and the allegations contained therein\nmay be understood to indicate that the degree of force applied was unreasonable. Although Petitioner’s\nclaim could have been stated in stronger terms, the district court’s dismissal was nonetheless premature\ngiven the liberal construction accorded to pro se pleadings.\n\fNo. 09-1381         Williams v. Curtin, et al.                                        Page 6\n\n\n        The district court thus should have considered the degree of force applied. Here,\nPetitioner alleges that an “assault squad” used a “chemical agent to disable” him.\nViewing Petitioner’s Complaint in the light most favorable to him—and assuming he can\nprove that Respondents acted with a culpable state of mind—his allegations of a violent\nextraction, complete with use of a chemical agent that caused some degree of injury to\nPetitioner, are adequate to plead that the pain inflicted was “sufficiently serious.” See\nid. at 1178-79 (“Injury and force . . . are only imperfectly correlated, and it is the latter\nthat ultimately counts. An inmate who is gratuitously beaten by guards does not lose his\nability to pursue an excessive force claim merely because he has the good fortune to\nescape without serious injury.”).\n\n                                     CONCLUSION\n\n        For the reasons set forth above, we REVERSE the decision of the district court\nand REMAND for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\f",

Although the district court may consider exhibits to the Complaint, Petitioner does not make such an admission in his actual Complaint and the allegations contained therein may be understood to indicate that the degree of force applied was unreasonable.

Williams, New Haven, Michigan, pro se.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*382</span> Before: KENNEDY, CLAY, and KETHLEDGE, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>OPINION</h2>\n<p>CLAY, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>Petitioner Michael Anthony Williams, a state inmate proceeding <i>pro se,</i> appeals the <i>sua sponte</i> dismissal of his Complaint against Respondent officials at the Oaks Correctional Facility (\"Respondents\") for failure to state a claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. For the reasons stated below, we REVERSE the decision of the district court and REMAND for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>All facts are taken from the Complaint, since those were the facts available to the district court. Petitioner alleges that, on or about October 25, 2007, he \"was subject to Cruel and Unusual Punishment\" when prison officers used a \"chemical agent to disable him and gain his compliance.\" According to the Complaint, prison officials sought to transfer Petitioner from Housing Unit No. 3 to Unit No. 5, both of which are administrative segregation units at the Oaks Correctional Facility.</p>\n<p>Petitioner alleges that upon being ordered to \"pack up\" his cell, Petitioner responded: \"What for, sir?\" At that point, an officer stated, \"ARUS Hernandez, order you [sic] to leave this cellblock.\" Respondent Pant then entered the cellblock with an \"assault squad,\" organized pursuant to an order by Respondent Curley, and released a \"chemical agent.\" This caused Petitioner \"to cough\" and resulted in a \"shortage of oxygen.\"</p>\n<p>Following Petitioner's unsuccessful attempts at relief through the internal prison grievance process,<sup>[1]</sup> Petitioner filed this instant § 1983 action on May 21, 2008. Upon an initial screening of the Complaint pursuant to the Prison Litigation Reform Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 1997e <i>et seq.,</i> the assigned magistrate judge filed a report and recommendation (\"R&amp;R\") that recommended dismissal for failure to state a claim. Petitioner filed objections to the R&amp;R that contained factual allegations not contained in the Complaint. The district court refused to consider the new allegations, and adopted the R&amp;R on June 19, 2008 as the decision of the district court. Petitioner now appeals.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>DISCUSSION</h2>\n<p>The district court appears to have relied upon two grounds to dismiss the Complaint. First, the district court found that Petitioner's alleged injuries were \"de minimus [sic].\" Second, the district court found that Respondents' conduct was reasonable, stating that the chemical agent \"was applied in a good-faith effort to maintain or restore discipline, not to maliciously or to sadistically cause harm.\" The district court further reasoned that Petitioner admitted that he was \"noncompliant[] with [Respondents'] orders.\"</p>\n<p>On appeal, Petitioner asserts that the district court erred by: 1) incorrectly stating <span class=\"star-pagination\">*383</span> that Petitioner disobeyed an order just prior to the use of chemical spray; and 2) misapplying the proper legal standards. We agree.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Standard of Review: Dismissal for Failure to State a Claim</h2>\n<p>This Court reviews <i>de novo</i> a district court's dismissal of a complaint for failure to state a claim. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Thomas v. Eby,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"797250\"><a href=\"/opinion/797250/jerald-thomas-v-unknown-eby/\"><span class=\"volume\">481</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">434</span></a></span>, 437 (6th Cir.2007). Accepting all well-pleaded allegations in the complaint as true, the Court \"consider[s] the factual allegations in [the] complaint to determine if they plausibly suggest an entitlement to relief.\" <i>Ashcroft v. Iqbal,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145875\"><a href=\"/opinion/145875/ashcroft-v-iqbal/\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1937</span></a></span>, 1951, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145875\"><a href=\"/opinion/145875/ashcroft-v-iqbal/\"><span class=\"volume\">173</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">868</span></a></span> (2009). <i>Pro se</i> complaints are to be held \"to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers,\" and should therefore be liberally construed. <i>See </i><i>Martin v. Overton,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"788572\"><a href=\"/opinion/788572/eric-martin-v-william-overton/\"><span class=\"volume\">391</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">710</span></a></span>, 712 (6th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Legal Standard: Eighth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution</h2>\n<p>The district court properly characterized Petitioner's claim as arising under the Eighth Amendment. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Graham v. Connor,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112257\"><a href=\"/opinion/112257/graham-v-connor/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">386</span></a></span>, 394, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112257\"><a href=\"/opinion/112257/graham-v-connor/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1865</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112257\"><a href=\"/opinion/112257/graham-v-connor/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">443</span></a></span> (1989); <i>Combs v. Wilkinson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"780379\"><a href=\"/opinion/780379/ronald-combs-jason-robb-and-george-skatzes-v-reginald-wilkinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">315</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">548</span></a></span>, 556 (6th Cir. 2002). The Eighth Amendment proscribes the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain against prisoners. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Whitley v. Albers,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111610\"><a href=\"/opinion/111610/whitley-v-albers/\"><span class=\"volume\">475</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">312</span></a></span>, 319, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111610\"><a href=\"/opinion/111610/whitley-v-albers/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1078</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111610\"><a href=\"/opinion/111610/whitley-v-albers/\"><span class=\"volume\">89</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">251</span></a></span> (1986). Although prison discipline may require that inmates endure relatively greater physical contact, the Eighth Amendment is nonetheless violated if the \"offending conduct reflects an unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain.\" <i>Pelfrey v. Chambers,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"685624\"><a href=\"/opinion/685624/david-l-pelfrey-v-sean-chambers-larry-closser-correction-officers/\"><span class=\"volume\">43</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1034</span></a></span>, 1037 (6th Cir.1995) (internal alterations and quotation marks omitted). To make out a claim under the Eighth Amendment, the prisoner must satisfy both an objective and a subjective component. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Moore v. Holbrook,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"628275\"><a href=\"/opinion/628275/william-c-moore-v-troy-e-holbrook-r-ginn-sgt-john-burton-sgt/\"><span class=\"volume\">2</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">697</span></a></span>, 700 (6th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p>The subjective component focuses on the state of mind of the prison officials. The relevant inquiry is \"whether force was applied in a good faith effort to maintain or restore discipline or maliciously and sadistically for the very purpose of causing harm.\" <i>Hudson v. McMillian,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112693\"><a href=\"/opinion/112693/hudson-v-mcmillian/\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 6, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112693\"><a href=\"/opinion/112693/hudson-v-mcmillian/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">156</span></a></span> (1992) (internal quotation marks omitted). Courts may consider \"the need for the application of force, the relationship between the need and the amount of force that was used, and the extent of injury inflicted.\" <i>Whitley,</i> 475 U.S. at 321, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111610\"><a href=\"/opinion/111610/whitley-v-albers/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1078</span></a></span>. Courts may also consider the circumstances \"as reasonably perceived by the responsible officials on the basis of the facts known to them, and any efforts made to temper the severity of a forceful response.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>The objective component requires the pain inflicted to be \"sufficiently serious.\" <i>Wilson v. Seiter,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112626\"><a href=\"/opinion/112626/wilson-v-seiter/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">294</span></a></span>, 298, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112626\"><a href=\"/opinion/112626/wilson-v-seiter/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2321</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112626\"><a href=\"/opinion/112626/wilson-v-seiter/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">271</span></a></span> (1991). This is a \"contextual\" inquiry that is \"responsive to contemporary standards of decency.\" <i>Hudson,</i> 503 U.S. at 8-9, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112693\"><a href=\"/opinion/112693/hudson-v-mcmillian/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">995</span></a></span> (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). The seriousness of the injuries are not dispositive; as the Supreme Court has held, \"[w]hen prison officials maliciously and sadistically use force to cause harm, contemporary standards of decency always are violated . . . whether or not significant injury is evident.\" <i>Id.</i> at 9, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112693\"><a href=\"/opinion/112693/hudson-v-mcmillian/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Application: Complaint States a Claim Under the Eighth Amendment</h2>\n<p>The district court erred in concluding that the Complaint fails to state a claim. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*384</span> Giving due regard to Petitioner's status as a <i>pro se</i> litigant, we find that the Complaint contains sufficient factual averments that, if true, \"state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face\" under the Eighth Amendment. <i>See </i><i>Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145730\"><a href=\"/opinion/145730/bell-atlantic-corp-v-twombly/\"><span class=\"volume\">550</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">544</span></a></span>, 570, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145730\"><a href=\"/opinion/145730/bell-atlantic-corp-v-twombly/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">929</span></a></span> (2007).</p>\n<p>With regard to the subjective component of an Eighth Amendment claim, Petitioner has sufficiently alleged that Respondents acted with a culpable state of mind. Contrary to the statements of the district court, Petitioner does not admit that he disobeyed a direct order.<sup>[2]</sup> Petitioner alleges that, when instructed to \"pack up,\" he inquired, \"What for, sir?,\" at which point an \"assault team\" entered the cell and used a chemical agent on him. These facts, if true, may permit a finding that the use and/or amount of force was unnecessary, which may suggest that Respondents' actions were not taken in good faith and were perhaps motivated by the malicious purpose of causing harm.</p>\n<p>Likewise, with regard to the objective component of an Eighth Amendment claim, Petitioner has sufficiently alleged that Respondents inflicted \"sufficiently serious\" pain. Although the district court found that Petitioner's allegations of injurynamely, coughing and shortage of oxygenconstitute a \"de minimus [sic] injury,\" this finding is an insufficient basis upon which to dismiss the Complaint. <i>See </i><i>Wilkins,</i> 130 S.Ct. at 1178. If it were a sufficient basis, as the Supreme Court has explained, \"the Eighth Amendment would permit any physical punishment, no matter how diabolic or inhuman, inflicting less than some arbitrary quantity of injury.\" <i>Hudson,</i> 503 U.S. at 9, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112693\"><a href=\"/opinion/112693/hudson-v-mcmillian/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">995</span></a></span>. Indeed, the Supreme Court recently reversed a <i>sua sponte</i> dismissal of a prisoner's Eighth Amendment claim, where the lower court did so on the basis of <i>de minimis</i> injury. <i>See </i><i>Wilkins,</i> 130 S.Ct. at 1178-80. The Court rejected the argument that the Eighth Amendment requires a showing of significant injury, holding instead that the judicial inquiry should focus on \"the nature of the force rather than the extent of the injury.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1177.</p>\n<p>The district court thus should have considered the degree of force applied. Here, Petitioner alleges that an \"assault squad\" used a \"chemical agent to disable\" him.
