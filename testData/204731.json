In an unusual turn of events, ERISA makes this a\nsimple case. To determine the proper beneficiary of Thomas Blakeley’s life insurance\npolicy, ERISA says to look first at the text of the policy. But the court below overlooked\n\n        *\n        The Honorable Amul R. Thapar, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of\nKentucky, sitting by designation.\n\n\n                                              1\n\fNo. 09-4368         Union Security Ins. Co. v. Blakeley, et al.                       Page 2\n\n\na key piece of the policy’s text and instead resorted to the common law to decide that\nSondra Billet was the rightful beneficiary. This was error.\n\n                                             I.\n\n        When he died in December 2007, Thomas Blakeley left behind three children,\na cohabitant and purported fiancée named Sondra Billet, and a life insurance policy for\nwhich he neglected to select a beneficiary. In the absence of a designated beneficiary,\nthe policy says to distribute benefits in the following order: First to the insured’s spouse,\nthen to his domestic partner, his children (or his domestic partner’s children), his living\nparents, or his estate. Blakeley was unmarried, and the parties disagree whether Sondra\nBillet qualifies as a domestic partner. Union Security Insurance Company filed an\ninterpleader action to identify the correct beneficiary.\n\n        The magistrate judge observed that the life insurance policy qualified as an\nERISA plan, Union Sec. Ins. Co. v. Blakeley, No. 3:08-120 (S.D. Ohio Oct. 6, 2009), R.\n29 at 8-9; see also 29 U.S.C. § 1002(1), and looked for a definition of “domestic partner”\nin the plan’s “general definition” section first.        Finding none there, she turned\nimmediately to the federal common law, id. at 10-11, for which Ohio law was one\nsource, id. at 11. There she found a definition in Ohio’s Code of Judicial Conduct and\nlargely adopted it: “The phrase ‘domestic partner’ . . . is defined as a person with whom\nanother person maintains a household and an intimate relationship, other than a person\nto whom he or she is legally married, and whose relationship shares other indicia of\nbeing more than mere companions or friends.” Id. at 11-12. With this definition, the\nMagistrate Judge held that the relationship between Blakeley and Billet qualified. Id.\nat 14. The children now appeal.\n\n        We review the court’s interpretation of the plan de novo. Waxman v. Luna, 881\nF.2d 237, 240 (6th Cir. 1989) (following bench trial in ERISA case, court reviews\nfactual findings for clear error and conclusions of law and application of law to facts de\nnovo (citation omitted)); see also Unicare Life and Health Ins. Co. v. Craig, 157 F.\nApp’x 787, 790 (6th Cir. 2005) (following bench trial in ERISA case, court reviews legal\nconclusions de novo).\n\fNo. 09-4368         Union Security Ins. Co. v. Blakeley, et al.                      Page 3\n\n\n                                             II.\n\n        By abandoning the text of the plan because the general definition section did not\ninclude “domestic partner,” the magistrate judge was too quick to look to the federal\ncommon law. See R. 29 at 10-11. While courts do sometimes resort to federal common\nlaw to identify beneficiaries under ERISA plans, the text of the plan is the much\npreferred source. As this Court has explained, ERISA, rather than the federal common\nlaw, “supplies the rule of law.” Metro. Life Ins. Co. v. Pressley, 82 F.3d 126, 129-30\n(6th Cir. 1996); see also Mertens v. Hewitt Assocs., 508 U.S. 248, 259 (1993) (“The\nauthority of courts to develop a federal common law under ERISA . . . is not the\nauthority to revise the text of the statute.”) (internal citation and quotation marks\nomitted). And ERISA directs that the plan documents determine the beneficiaries,\nPressley, 82 F.3d at 130 (citing 29 U.S.C. §1104(a)(1)(D)), and repeatedly underscores\nthe primacy of the written plan. The statute says, for instance, that employee benefit\nplans should be captured in a “written instrument”; specifies that plan administrators are\nto “act in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the plan”; and\nauthorizes participants or beneficiaries to “bring a cause of action to recover benefits due\nto [them] under the terms of [the] plan[.]” Kennedy v. Plan Adm’r for DuPont Sav. and\nInv. Plan, 129 S. Ct. 865, 875 (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted) (citing\n29 U.S.C. §§ 1102(a)(1), 1104(a)(1)(D), 1132(a)(1)(B)). Hence, if courts can identify\na workable means of identifying beneficiaries in the plan document—whether it be in\na general definition section or in the plan as a whole, Mitzel v. Anthem Life Ins. Co.,\n351 F. App’x 74, 90 (6th Cir. 2009) (“Under federal common law, ERISA plans, like\ncontracts, are to be construed as a whole.”) (internal quotation marks omitted)—they\n“need look no further.” McMillan v. Parrott, 913 F.2d 310, 312 (6th Cir. 1990); see also\nKennedy, 129 S. Ct. at 874-77 (holding that adherence to the text of the plan is\npreferable to resort to variable federal common law).\n\n        Here, the text of Mr. Blakeley’s life insurance plan, read as a whole, does define\n“domestic partner.” While true that “domestic partner” is missing from the plan’s\ngeneral definition section, R. 29 at 10, the plan elsewhere lists criteria to help pinpoint\n\fNo. 09-4368         Union Security Ins. Co. v. Blakeley, et al.                   Page 4\n\n\na true “domestic partner” whose life is also insurable under the plan. R. 1, Attach. 1 at\n37, 50. They are:\n\n       (1)     You and your domestic partner have had a committed relationship of\n               mutual caring which has existed for at least 6 months, or meet the\n               requirements and have registered as domestic partners, if the controlling\n               governmental authority provides for such registration;\n       (2)     You and your domestic partner are each age 18 or more and mentally\n               competent to consent to contract;\n       (3)     Neither you nor your domestic partner are married to someone else, and\n               your relationship is mutually exclusive;\n       (4)     You and your domestic partner are not related by blood any closer than\n               would prohibit legal marriage;\n       (5)     You and your domestic partner are financially interdependent;\n       (6)     You and your domestic partner each have power of attorney for each\n               other; and\n       (7)     At least 6 months have elapsed since similar coverage was terminated on\n               a previously insured domestic partner, if any, unless the previous\n               domestic partner has died.\n\n       These criteria offer the framework for deciding whether Sondra Billet qualifies\nas a true “domestic partner” and thus a rightful beneficiary under the plan document.\nThough not styled as a definition of the words “domestic partner,” they nonetheless help\ndistinguish a true partner from a friendly roommate or casual significant other. And so\nthis section ought to have been the last stop in the lower court’s search for a way to\ndecide whether Sondra Billet qualified.\n\n       Using these textual criteria, rather than the federal common law, it appears the\nlower court may have reached a different conclusion. The list says a true domestic\npartner and the insured must each have power of attorney for the other. Yet neither the\ncourt below nor the parties point to facts to indicate that Sondra Billet and Thomas\nBlakeley met this requirement. The facts we do have—the facts to indicate that their\nrelationship was a close one—are not enough. We are unaware of any Ohio law to\nsuggest that courts can simply infer a power of attorney on the basis of a couple’s\n\fNo. 09-4368         Union Security Ins. Co. v. Blakeley, et al.                   Page 5\n\n\nintimacy. In fact, just the opposite—Ohio law requires that a power of attorney be\ncaptured in a “written instrument,” LeMar v. Ickes, No. 08-36, 2009 WL 2215091, at *2\n(Ohio Ct. App. July 27, 2009), and apparently must be “executed,” even among domestic\npartners and married couples. See In re Mullen, 924 N.E.2d 448, 451 (Ohio. Ct. App.\n2009) (suggesting that a domestic partner’s power of attorney must be “executed”);\nGupta v. Lincoln Nat’l Life Ins. Co., No. 05-378, 2005 WL 3304019, at *1 (Ohio Ct.\nApp. Dec. 6, 2005) (suggesting that a married couple’s power of attorney must be\n“executed”).\n\n        On remand, then, it must be determined whether Sondra Billet and Thomas\nBlakeley held a power of attorney for each other (and, if so, whether she qualifies under\nthe other six criteria). If not, the appellants prevail.\n\n                                            III.\n\n        The judgment is VACATED, and this case is REMANDED for further\nproceedings.\n\f",

Finding none there, she turned immediately to the federal common law, <i>id.</i> at 10-11, for which Ohio law was one source, <i>id.</i> at 11. There she found a definition in Ohio's Code of Judicial Conduct and largely adopted it: \"The phrase `domestic partner' ... is defined as a person with whom another person maintains a household and an intimate relationship, other than a person to whom he or she is legally married, and whose relationship shares other indicia of being more than mere companions or friends.\" <i>Id.</i> at 11-12. With this definition, the Magistrate Judge held that the relationship between Blakeley and Billet qualified. <i>Id.</i> at 14.

While courts do sometimes resort to federal common law to identify beneficiaries under ERISA plans, the text of the plan is the much preferred source.

R. 1, Attach. 1 at 37, 50. They are:</p>\n<blockquote>(1) You and your domestic partner have had a committed relationship of mutual caring which has existed for at least 6 months, or meet the requirements and have registered as domestic partners, if the controlling governmental authority provides for such registration;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(2) You and your domestic partner are each age 18 or more and mentally competent to consent to contract;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(3) Neither you nor your domestic partner are married to someone else, and your relationship is mutually exclusive;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(4) You and your domestic partner are not related by blood any closer than would prohibit legal marriage;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(5) You and your domestic partner are financially interdependent;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(6) You and your domestic partner each have power of attorney for each other; <i>and</i>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(7) At least 6 months have elapsed since similar coverage was terminated on a previously insured domestic partner, if any, unless the previous domestic partner has died.</blockquote>\n<p>These criteria offer the framework for deciding whether Sondra Billet qualifies as a true \"domestic partner\" and thus a rightful beneficiary under the plan document. Though not styled as a definition of the words \"domestic partner,\" they nonetheless help distinguish a true partner from a friendly roommate or casual significant other. And so this section ought to have been the last stop in the lower court's search for a way to decide whether Sondra Billet qualified.</p>\n<p>Using these textual criteria, rather than the federal common law, it appears the lower court may have reached a different conclusion. The list says a true domestic partner and the insured must each have power of attorney for the other. Yet neither the court below nor the parties point to facts to indicate that Sondra Billet and Thomas Blakeley met this requirement. The facts we do havethe facts to indicate that their relationship was a close oneare not enough. We are unaware of any Ohio law to suggest that courts can simply infer a power of attorney on the basis of a couple's intimacy. In fact, just the oppositeOhio law requires that a power of attorney be captured in a \"written instrument,\" <i>LeMar v.
