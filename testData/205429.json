The district court\ndismissed his action and denied his motion to amend his complaint. We AFFIRM the\ndecision of the district court.\n\n\n\n\n                                              1\n\fNo. 09-5645         Carson v. United States Office of Special Counsel                 Page 2\n\n\n                                   I. BACKGROUND\n\n        Carson is employed as a nuclear safety engineer at the Department of Energy.\nSince 1992, he has filed twenty-five complaints with the Office of Special Counsel, an\nindependent investigatory and prosecutorial agency that is charged with, among other\nthings, investigating complaints under the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989, Pub.\nL. No. 101-12, 103 Stat. 16 (codified in scattered sections of 5 U.S.C.). Carson also has\nfiled six mandamus actions against the Office of Special Counsel, five of which have\nbeen filed in and dismissed by the United States District Court for the District of\nColumbia. He filed the instant lawsuit in August 2008, seeking an order compelling the\nOffice of Special Counsel to investigate complaints that he filed and to make reports to\nthe Department of Energy.\n\n        The Office of Special Counsel investigates two kinds of complaints filed by\nfederal employees that are relevant to this case. First, it “shall receive any allegation of\na prohibited personnel practice and shall investigate the allegation to the extent\nnecessary to determine whether there are reasonable grounds to believe that a prohibited\npersonnel practice has occurred.” 5 U.S.C. § 1214(a)(1)(A) (1994). Under the Act, it\nis a “prohibited personnel practice” for a government agency to take a “personnel\naction” against an employee because of his disclosure of illegal activity or of “gross\nmismanagement, a gross waste of funds, . . . or a substantial and specific danger to\npublic health or safety.” Id. § 2302(b)(8). Second, the Office of Special Counsel “shall\n. . . conduct an investigation of any allegation concerning . . . activities prohibited by any\ncivil service law, rule, or regulation.” Id. § 1216(a)(4).\n\n        An employee who wishes to report a prohibited personnel practice or prohibited\nactivity must first complain to the Office of Special Counsel.                See 5 C.F.R.\n§ 1800.1(c)(1) (2010). The initial investigation into both these types of complaints is\nconducted by the Office of Special Counsel’s Complaints Examining Unit. See id.\n§ 1800.1(c)(4). After an initial investigation, the Unit either refers the complaint to the\nInvestigation and Prosecution Division or closes the complaint.\n\fNo. 09-5645        Carson v. United States Office of Special Counsel                Page 3\n\n\n       Section 1214 provides additional procedures governing the investigation of\nprohibited personnel practices. While an investigation is pending, the Office of Special\nCounsel must provide written status updates to the complainant.             See 5 U.S.C.\n§ 1214(a)(1)(C). If the Office of Special Counsel determines that a prohibited personnel\npractice has occurred, it must report its findings to the Merit Systems Protection Board,\nand it may petition the Board to take action on behalf of the employee. See id.\n§ 1214(b)(2)(B)-(C). Even if the Office of Special Counsel’s investigation does not\nsupport the employee’s complaint, the employee still may bring an individual action\nbefore the Merit Systems Protection Board. See id. § 1221. In either case, the decision\nof the Merit Systems Protection Board—but not that of the Office of Special\nCounsel—is appealable to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. See id. § 7703.\n\n       Unlike the mandatory procedures governing prohibited personnel practice\ncomplaints, section 1216, which governs prohibited activity complaints, provides that\n“[i]f the Special Counsel receives an allegation concerning any matter under [section\n1216(a)(4)], the Special Counsel may investigate and seek corrective action under\nsection 1214 and disciplinary action under section 1215 in the same way as if a\nprohibited personnel practice were involved.” Id. § 1216(c) (emphasis added).\n\n       This appeal involves five complaints made by Carson: four prohibited activity\ncomplaints, and one prohibited personnel practice complaint.\n\n       Complaints MA-08-1842, MA-08-1843, and MA-08-2553 allege various\nprohibited activities. MA-08-1842 alleges that the Department of Energy materially\nbreached a settlement agreement. MA-08-1843 alleges that the Department of Energy\nviolated its grievance policy and procedures in failing to process several grievances that\nCarson presented. MA-08-2553 alleges that Carson’s managers and colleagues violated\na Department of Energy Order in making false statements about him. The Complaints\nExamining Unit investigated each of these complaints by reviewing the information that\nCarson provided and conducting legal research. The Office of Special Counsel\nterminated the investigations because it found that there was insufficient evidence of any\nactivities prohibited by civil service law, rule, or regulation to warrant further action.\n\fNo. 09-5645         Carson v. United States Office of Special Counsel              Page 4\n\n\n         Complaint MA 08-1844, a prohibited activity complaint, and complaint\nMA-07-1668, a prohibited personnel practice complaint, both allege that the Department\nof Energy delayed nine months in providing Carson corrective action ordered by the\nMerit Systems Protection Board. The Office of Special Counsel investigated these\ncomplaints jointly and later terminated its investigation.\n\n         After Carson filed a petition for a writ of mandamus regarding two complaints\nand moved to supplement it several times, the district court ordered him to file a single,\ndefinitive, amended petition. Carson filed an Amended Petition on November 20, 2008.\nThe Office of Special Counsel moved to dismiss his Amended Petition on January 23,\n2009. On February 9, Carson moved to amend his Amended Petition, seeking to add\nnew claims about complaints MA-07-1668 and MA-08-1844. The district court granted\nthe Office of Special Counsel’s motion to dismiss and denied Carson leave to amend on\nMay 11. Carson appeals.\n\n            II. CARSON’S PETITION FOR A WRIT OF MANDAMUS\n\nA. Subject Matter Jurisdiction in General\n\n         A court of appeals “must determine its own jurisdiction and is bound to do so in\nevery instance.” Dickerson v. McClellan, 37 F.3d 251, 252 (6th Cir. 1994). We have\njurisdiction over this appeal if the district court had jurisdiction over this action. See\nWeber v. United States, 209 F.3d 756, 759 (D.C. Cir. 2000). The district court\neffectively concluded that it had subject matter jurisdiction to issue a writ of mandamus\nif it determined that the Office of Special Counsel violated a non-discretionary duty to\ninvestigate Carson’s allegations. We review a district court’s findings as to whether it\nhad subject matter jurisdiction de novo. Willis v. Sullivan, 931 F.2d 390, 395 (6th Cir.\n1991).\n\n         Mandamus jurisdiction in federal courts is codified at 28 U.S.C. § 1361, which\nprovides that “[t]he district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any action in the\nnature of mandamus to compel an officer or employee of the United States or any agency\nthereof to perform a duty owed to the plaintiff.” “The existence of jurisdiction under\n\fNo. 09-5645          Carson v. United States Office of Special Counsel                  Page 5\n\n\nsection 1361 is inextricably bound with the merits of whether a writ of mandamus should\nissue; in order to establish either jurisdiction or entitlement to the writ, a court must find\nthat a duty is owed to the plaintiff.” Maczko v. Joyce, 814 F.2d 308, 310 (6th Cir. 1987).\n“[T]he remedy of mandamus is a drastic one, to be invoked only in extraordinary\nsituations.” Allied Chem. Corp. v. Daiflon, Inc., 449 U.S. 33, 34 (1980). Mandamus is\navailable only if: “(1) the plaintiff has a clear right to relief; (2) the defendant has a clear\nduty to act; and (3) there is no other adequate remedy available to the plaintiff.” In re\nMedicare Reimbursement Litig., 414 F.3d 7, 10 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (internal quotation\nmarks and citation omitted). Mandamus is not an appropriate remedy if the action that\nthe petitioner seeks to compel is discretionary. See, e.g., Heckler v. Ringer, 466 U.S.\n602, 616 (1984).\n\n        We have never decided whether a district court may issue a writ of mandamus\nagainst the Office of Special Counsel for failure to investigate a claim. See Ryon v.\nO’Neill, 894 F.2d 199, 205 n.3 (6th Cir. 1990) (stating that whether mandamus is\navailable to enforce the Office of Special Counsel’s investigatory duty is an “open\nquestion” in the Sixth Circuit). However, the District of Columbia Circuit has concluded\nthat a district court does have subject matter jurisdiction to issue a writ of mandamus if\nit determines that the Office of Special Counsel violated a non-discretionary statutory\nduty to investigate an employee’s allegations. See Weber, 209 F.3d at 759. The District\nof Columbia Circuit reasoned that because the Federal Circuit has authority to review\nonly Merit Systems Protection Board decisions and not Office of Special Counsel\ndecisions, “if district courts lacked power to issue the writ, judicial review of [Office of\nSpecial Counsel] actions would not be available.” Id. Similarly, the Fifth Circuit has\nheld that federal courts have authority to ensure that the Office of Special Counsel\ncomplies with its statutory obligations. See DeLeonardis v. Weiseman, 986 F.2d 725,\n727 (5th Cir. 1993) (“[A]n employee’s right to obtain judicial review of the [Office of\nSpecial Counsel’s] decision not to pursue a complaint is limited to [the question of]\nwhether the [Office of Special Counsel] discharged its duty to investigate the\ncomplaint.”) (second alteration in original) (internal quotation marks and citation\nomitted); accord Nowick v. Strickland, Nos. 98-1206, 98-1207, 98-1212, 1999 WL\n\fNo. 09-5645         Carson v. United States Office of Special Counsel                Page 6\n\n\n282389, at *3 (10th Cir. Apr. 30, 1999) (noting its authority to ensure that the Office of\nSpecial Counsel complied with its statutory obligations); Hyde v. Office of Special\nCounsel, No. 94-1406, 1995 WL 238340, at *1 (10th Cir. Apr. 21, 1995) (same). We\nfind the reasoning of our sister circuits persuasive and thus hold that a district court has\nsubject matter jurisdiction to issue a writ of mandamus if it determines that the Office\nof Special Counsel violated a non-discretionary statutory duty to investigate an\nemployee’s allegations.\n\n        However, this holding does not imply that district courts have jurisdiction to\nreview all Office of Special Counsel determinations. Various courts have held that\ndistrict courts have no jurisdiction to review the Office of Special Counsel’s decision to\nterminate an investigation or not to petition the Merit Systems Protection Board. See\nDeLeonardis, 986 F.2d at 727 (“We agree with our colleagues of the D.C. Circuit that\nwhen the [Office of Special Counsel] decides to terminate an investigation that it began\npursuant to a complaint, the decision is not reviewable.”); Wren v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.,\n681 F.2d 867, 876 n.9 (D.C. Cir. 1982) (“It is also quite clear from the statutory\nlanguage and corresponding legislative history that Congress did not mean to make the\n[Office of Special Counsel’s] decisions to terminate or conduct an investigation or bring\na proceeding before the Board reviewable on the merits.”). In addition, several\nunpublished opinions have followed this approach. See Hyde, 1995 WL 238340, at *1\n(holding that district courts have no authority to require the Office of Special Counsel\nto reconsider a complaint and resolve it a certain way); DeLeonardis v. Koch, Civ. A.\nNo. H-90-3768, 1992 WL 465474, at *3 (S.D. Tex. July 1, 1992) (“[A] district court may\nnot review [Office of Special Counsel’s] decision to terminate its investigation, or\n[Office of Special Counsel’s] decision not to petition the [Merit Systems Protection\nBoard].”) (citation omitted).\n\n        Carson contends that this case is controlled by Weber, 209 F.3d at 759. In\nWeber, the plaintiff, a former Army employee, complained to the Office of Special\nCounsel that he had been stripped of a security clearance in retaliation for\nwhistleblowing. Id. at 757. The Office of Special Counsel “declined to investigate” the\n\fNo. 09-5645            Carson v. United States Office of Special Counsel                            Page 7\n\n\nplaintiff’s complaint because it concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to investigate the\ncomplaint. Id. at 758. The plaintiff then sought a writ of mandamus to compel the\nOffice of Special Counsel to investigate his accusation. Id. Thus, in both Weber and the\npresent case, the Office of Special Counsel concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to\ninvestigate a complaint, and the plaintiff sought a writ of mandamus to compel it to\ninvestigate. In Weber, the district court held that “there is no judicial review of the\nmerits of the [Office of Special Counsel’s] decision to dispense with an investigation.”\nWeber v. Office of Special Counsel, No. 97-2260-LFO, slip op. at 6. (D.D.C. Feb. 10,\n1999). Then, the District of Columbia Circuit held that a district court has subject matter\njurisdiction to issue a writ of mandamus if it determines that the Office of Special\nCounsel violated a non-discretionary statutory duty to investigate an employee’s\nallegations. Weber, 209 F.3d at 759. Because the Office of Special Counsel declined\nto investigate because it believed that it lacked jurisdiction, the District of Columbia\nCircuit appears to have held that the Office of Special Counsel’s determinations of its\nown jurisdiction are subject to judicial review. See id.\n\n         We decline to rely on Weber to hold that district courts have authority to review\nthe jurisdictional determinations of the Office of Special Counsel for a number of\nreasons. In this case the record indicates that the Office of Special Counsel conducted\na preliminary investigation into Carson’s claims. But it is unclear from the Weber\ndecision whether the Office of Special Counsel initiated any investigation at all into the\nplaintiff’s claim in that case.1\n\n         Additionally, to the extent that Weber holds that district courts have authority to\nreview the jurisdictional determinations of the Office of Special Counsel, we find the\nFifth Circuit’s reasoning to the contrary to be more persuasive. In DeLeonardis, 986\nF.2d at 727, the plaintiff argued that “courts are allowed to look behind the agency’s\n\n\n         1\n            The District of Columbia Circuit opinion states that the Office of Special Counsel had “declined\nto investigate” the complaint. Weber, 209 F.3d at 758. The district court’s opinion initially states that the\nOffice of Special Counsel “decided not to pursue the complaint.” But it later states that the Office of\nSpecial Counsel “considered the plaintiff’s complaint,” and decided to “dispense with an investigation.”\nWeber v. Office of Special Counsel, No. 97-2260-LFO, slip op. at 2, 4, and 6. (D.D.C. Feb. 10, 1999).\nThus, it is somewhat unclear whether the Office of Special Counsel declined to investigate the plaintiff’s\ncomplaint at all or merely declined to continue its initial investigation.\n\fNo. 09-5645         Carson v. United States Office of Special Counsel                 Page 8\n\n\ndecision to terminate an investigation when . . . the agency applies the incorrect legal\nstandard in deciding to terminate the investigation.” The Fifth Circuit rejected this claim\nand stated that the plaintiff failed “to recognize, or at least to admit, that to allow him to\nsucceed on this argument we would have to vitiate the clearly established rule that we\ndo not look behind substantive [Office of Special Counsel] determinations to terminate\ninvestigations.” Id. Jurisdiction is a legal issue similar to the legal standard in dispute\nin DeLeonardis. Thus, we hold that a district court has subject matter jurisdiction to\nissue a writ of mandamus only if it determines that the Office of Special Counsel has\ndeclined to investigate a complaint at all; it has no subject matter jurisdiction to consider\nthe Office of Special Counsel’s jurisdictional determinations or the merits of its\ninvestigations. Now that we have established this main point, Carson’s individual claims\nare easily resolved.\n\nB. Complaints MA-08-1842, MA-08-1843, and MA-08-2553\n\n        The district court correctly concluded that it had no subject matter jurisdiction\nto issue a writ of mandamus regarding these three prohibited activity complaints. The\nOffice of Special Counsel satisfies its statutory obligation when the Complaints\nExamining Unit conducts an initial investigation sufficient for it to determine whether\na more thorough investigation is required. Cf. Wren, 681 F.2d at 874 (discussing\nstatutory language governing prohibited personnel practice complaints). Here, the\nOffice of Special Counsel conducted a preliminary investigation of Carson’s allegations\nand concluded that further inquiry was unnecessary because he did not allege violations\nof civil service laws, rules, or regulations. Carson does not contend that the Office of\nSpecial Counsel failed to investigate his complaint; he contends that the investigation\nwas inadequate. District courts may not review the Office of Special Counsel’s\nsubstantive decision to discontinue an investigation for lack of cause. Thus, the district\ncourt could not order the Office of Special Counsel to conduct an additional\ninvestigation into Carson’s claims after the Office of Special Counsel conducted\npreliminary investigations and decided to close them. Because the Office of Special\nCounsel discharged its statutory obligations by investigating these three complaints,\n\fNo. 09-5645         Carson v. United States Office of Special Counsel                 Page 9\n\n\nCarson is not entitled to a writ of mandamus. Thus, we AFFIRM the decision of the\ndistrict court.\n\nC. Section 1214(e) Reporting Requirement\n\n        5 U.S.C. § 1214(e) provides that:\n\n        If, in connection with any investigation under this subchapter, the Special\n        Counsel determines that there is reasonable cause to believe that any\n        violation of any law, rule, or regulation has occurred other than one\n        referred to in subsection (b) or (d), the Special Counsel shall report such\n        violation to the head of the agency involved.\n\n        Carson seeks a writ ordering the Office of Special Counsel to report the\nallegations that he raised in his complaints to the Secretary of Energy pursuant to section\n1214(e). However, the district court correctly concluded that the Office of Special\nCounsel had no duty to report violations of law, rule, or regulation because the Office\nof Special Counsel never found that such violations had occurred.\n\n        Carson asks us to resolve his disagreement with the Office of Special Counsel\nabout the meaning of the phrase “any law, rule, or regulation” in section 1214(e).\nCarson suggests that the phrase applies to violations of law, rule, or regulation under the\njurisdiction of the Office of Special Counsel. The Office of Special Counsel, on the\nother hand, asserts that the phrase applies to violations of law, rule, or regulation that it\ndiscovers during an investigation but over which it lacks jurisdiction under section 1214\nor 1216. However, it is unnecessary for us to resolve this dispute because the Office of\nSpecial Counsel never found reasonable cause to believe that any violations of law, rule,\nor regulation occurred. Therefore, we have no authority to issue a purely advisory\nopinion on this debate. See, e.g., North Carolina v. Rice, 404 U.S. 244, 246 (1971)\n(“[F]ederal courts are without power to decide questions that cannot affect the rights of\nlitigants in the case before them.”). Thus, we AFFIRM the decision of the district court.\n\fNo. 09-5645            Carson v. United States Office of Special Counsel                           Page 10\n\n\n                           III. CARSON’S MOTION TO AMEND\n\n         Carson does not contest the merits of the district court’s decisions regarding\ncomplaints MA-08-1844 and MA-07-1668.2 Rather, he claims that the district court\nerred in denying his motion to amend the petition in light of the Office of Special\nCounsel’s decision regarding these two complaints. Carson moved to amend his petition\nto add allegations that, in closing these two complaints, the Office of Special Counsel\nfailed to comply with the requirements set out in a statutory note following section 1214.\nThe district court found that Carson’s additional allegations would be futile because the\nOffice of Special Counsel had already performed the non-discretionary duties it owed\nCarson. Because the district court based its decision to deny leave to amend on the legal\nconclusion that amendment would be futile, we review this decision de novo. Yuhasz\nv. Brush Wellman, Inc., 341 F.3d 559, 569 (6th Cir. 2003).\n\n         Leave to amend must be freely given when justice so requires. Fed. R. Civ. P.\n15(a). Nevertheless, leave to amend “should be denied if the amendment is brought in\nbad faith, for dilatory purposes, results in undue delay or prejudice to the opposing party,\nor would be futile.” Crawford v. Roane, 53 F.3d 750, 753 (6th Cir. 1995).\n\n         The statutory note following section 1214 provides that:\n\n         The Special Counsel shall include in any letter terminating an\n         investigation under section 1214(a)(2) of title 5, United States Code . . .\n         the name and telephone number of an employee of the Special Counsel\n         who is available to respond to reasonable questions from the person\n         regarding the investigation or review conducted by the Special Counsel,\n         the relevant facts ascertained by the Special Counsel, and the law\n         applicable to the person’s allegations.\n\n\n\n\n         2\n           The district court correctly dismissed Carson’s claim that the Office of Special Counsel was\nrequired to provide him status reports regarding complaint MA-08-1844, a prohibited activity complaint,\nbecause the Office of Special Counsel is not required to provide status reports regarding prohibited activity\ncomplaints under section 1214. The district court correctly dismissed Carson’s claim regarding\nMA-07-1668, a prohibited personnel practice complaint, because the Office of Special Counsel performed\nits duty to make a “reasonable basis” determination under section 1214 by explaining its basis for\nproposing to close his complaint, reviewing Carson’s written comments to this proposal, and later\nterminating its investigation and closing the complaint.\n\fNo. 09-5645         Carson v. United States Office of Special Counsel              Page 11\n\n\nUnited States Office of Special Counsel, Merit Systems Protection Board: Authorization,\nPub. L. 103-424 § 12(b), 108 Stat. 4361, 4367 (1994). Carson contends that the person\nwhose name and number he was given did not respond to his “reasonable questions.”\n\n        For a writ of mandamus to be warranted, “there must be a mandatory or\nministerial obligation. If the alleged duty is discretionary or directory, the duty is not\nowed.” Maczko, 814 F.2d at 310 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). “A\nduty is not owed unless the obligation is plainly defined and peremptory.” Id. (internal\nquotation marks and citation omitted). Although the Office of Special Counsel had a\nduty to comply with the statutory note following section 1214, the terms of that note are\nnot readily ascertainable.      “[W]hen a duty is disputed or subject to various\ninterpretations, . . . the duty is not ‘owed’ in that the obligation to do a particular act\ncannot be said to be clear, peremptory, defined or ministerial within the meaning of\nsection 1361.” Id. There is clearly discretion involved in responding “to reasonable\nquestions from the person regarding the investigation or review conducted by the Special\nCounsel, the relevant facts ascertained by the Special Counsel, and the law applicable\nto the person’s allegations.” United States Office of Special Counsel, Merit Systems\nProtection Board: Authorization, Pub. L. 103-424 § 12(b), 108 Stat. 4361, 4367. Carson\nsought leave to amend his petition to request a writ of mandamus to enforce a statutory\nnote that is subject to differing interpretations. This amendment would be futile because\nthe district court would have no authority to issue the requested writ under section 1361.\n\n        Furthermore, we note that because MA-08-1844 is a prohibited activity\ncomplaint, the procedural requirements of section 1214 do not apply to it in any case.\nSection 1216, which governs prohibited activity complaints, provides that “[i]f the\nSpecial Counsel receives an allegation concerning [activities prohibited by any civil\nservice law, rule, or regulation], the Special Counsel may investigate and seek corrective\naction under section 1214 and disciplinary action under section 1215 in the same way\nas if a prohibited personnel practice were involved.” 5 U.S.C. § 1216(c) (emphasis\nadded). The plain text of the statute suggests that the Office of Special Counsel is not\nrequired to provide status reports regarding prohibited activity allegations, but rather has\n\fNo. 09-5645         Carson v. United States Office of Special Counsel              Page 12\n\n\nthis discretionary power. See also Perkins v. Office of Special Counsel, 522 F.3d 1373,\n1376 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (“[S]ubsection (c) of section 1216 specifies that [Office of Special\nCounsel] may seek corrective action under section 1214 . . . for activities described in\n[section 1216(a)(4)] in the same way as if a prohibited personnel practice were\ninvolved.” (internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis added)). Thus, the district court\ncorrectly found that under section 1216, the Office of Special Counsel’s decision\nwhether to follow section 1214’s procedural requirements was discretionary, and thus\npermitting Carson to amend his petition regarding a section 1216(a) investigation would\nbe futile. Therefore, we AFFIRM the district court’s denial of Carson’s motion for\nleave to amend.\n\n                                  IV. CONCLUSION\n\n        We hold that a district court has subject matter jurisdiction to issue a writ of\nmandamus only if it determines that the Office of Special Counsel has declined to\ninvestigate a complaint at all; it has no subject matter jurisdiction to consider the Office\nof Special Counsel’s jurisdictional determinations or the merits of its investigations. The\ndistrict court had no subject matter jurisdiction to issue a writ of mandamus regarding\ncomplaints MA-08-1842, MA-08-1843, and MA-08-2553 because the Office of Special\nCounsel had fulfilled its statutory duty to investigate these complaints. The district court\nhad no subject matter jurisdiction to issue a writ of mandamus to order the Office of\nSpecial Counsel to report allegations pursuant to section 1214(e) because the Office of\nSpecial Counsel never found that any violation of law, rule, or regulation occurred.\nThus, we AFFIRM the district court’s dismissal of Carson’s claims.\n\n        We find that because the section 1214 statutory note regarding responding to\n“reasonable questions” is subject to differing interpretations, the district court correctly\nfound that permitting Carson to amend his petition would be futile. Thus, we AFFIRM\nthe district court’s dismissal of Carson’s motion to amend.\n\f",

Harber, Assistant United States Attorney, Knoxville, Tennessee, for Appellee. Joseph P. Carson, Knoxville, Tennessee, pro se. David B. Nolan, Alexandria, Virginia, for Amici Curiae.</p>\n<p>Before: MARTIN, BOGGS, and COOK, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>OPINION</h2>\n<p>BOYCE F. MARTIN, JR., Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>Pro se litigant Joseph P. Carson sought a writ of mandamus to compel the Office of Special Counsel to investigate complaints that he filed and to make reports to the Department of Energy. The district court dismissed his action and denied his motion to amend his complaint. We AFFIRM the decision of the district court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Carson is employed as a nuclear safety engineer at the Department of Energy. Since 1992, he has filed twenty-five complaints with the Office of Special Counsel, an independent investigatory and prosecutorial agency that is charged with, among other things, investigating complaints under the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989, Pub. L. No. 101-12, 103 Stat. 16 (codified in scattered sections of 5 U.S.C.). Carson also has filed six mandamus actions against the Office of Special Counsel, five of which have been filed in and dismissed by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. He filed the instant lawsuit in August 2008, seeking an order compelling the Office of Special Counsel to investigate complaints that he filed and to make reports to the Department of Energy.</p>\n<p>The Office of Special Counsel investigates two kinds of complaints filed by federal employees that are relevant to this case. First, it \"shall receive any allegation of a prohibited personnel practice and shall investigate the allegation to the extent necessary to determine whether there are reasonable grounds to believe that a prohibited personnel practice has occurred.\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*490</span> 5 U.S.C. § 1214(a)(1)(A) (1994). Under the Act, it is a \"prohibited personnel practice\" for a government agency to take a \"personnel action\" against an employee because of his disclosure of illegal activity or of \"gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, . . . or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety.\" <i>Id.</i> § 2302(b)(8). Second, the Office of Special Counsel \"shall . . . conduct an investigation of any allegation concerning . . . activities prohibited by any civil service law, rule, or regulation.\" <i>Id.</i> § 1216(a)(4).</p>\n<p>An employee who wishes to report a prohibited personnel practice or prohibited activity must first complain to the Office of Special Counsel. <i>See</i> 5 C.F.R. § 1800.1(c)(1) (2010). The initial investigation into both these types of complaints is conducted by the Office of Special Counsel's Complaints Examining Unit. <i>See id.</i> § 1800.1(c)(4). After an initial investigation, the Unit either refers the complaint to the Investigation and Prosecution Division or closes the complaint.</p>\n<p>Section 1214 provides additional procedures governing the investigation of prohibited personnel practices. While an investigation is pending, the Office of Special Counsel must provide written status updates to the complainant. <i>See</i> 5 U.S.C. § 1214(a)(1)(C). If the Office of Special Counsel determines that a prohibited personnel practice has occurred, it must report its findings to the Merit Systems Protection Board, and it may petition the Board to take action on behalf of the employee. <i>See id.</i> § 1214(b)(2)(B)-(C). Even if the Office of Special Counsel's investigation does not support the employee's complaint, the employee still may bring an individual action before the Merit Systems Protection Board. <i>See id.</i> § 1221. In either case, the decision of the Merit Systems Protection Boardbut not that of the Office of Special Counselis appealable to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. <i>See id.</i> § 7703.</p>\n<p>Unlike the mandatory procedures governing prohibited personnel practice complaints, section 1216, which governs prohibited activity complaints, provides that \"[i]f the Special Counsel receives an allegation concerning any matter under [section 1216(a)(4)], the Special Counsel <i>may</i> investigate and seek corrective action under section 1214 and disciplinary action under section 1215 in the same way as if a prohibited personnel practice were involved.\" <i>Id.</i> § 1216(c) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>This appeal involves five complaints made by Carson: four prohibited activity complaints, and one prohibited personnel practice complaint.</p>\n<p>Complaints MA-08-1842, MA-08-1843, and MA-08-2553 allege various prohibited activities. MA-08-1842 alleges that the Department of Energy materially breached a settlement agreement. MA-08-1843 alleges that the Department of Energy violated its grievance policy and procedures in failing to process several grievances that Carson presented. MA-08-2553 alleges that Carson's managers and colleagues violated a Department of Energy Order in making false statements about him. The Complaints Examining Unit investigated each of these complaints by reviewing the information that Carson provided and conducting legal research. The Office of Special Counsel terminated the investigations because it found that there was insufficient evidence of any activities prohibited by civil service law, rule, or regulation to warrant further action.</p>\n<p>Complaint MA-08-1844, a prohibited activity complaint, and complaint MA-07-1668, a prohibited personnel practice complaint, both allege that the Department of Energy delayed nine months in providing Carson corrective action ordered by the Merit Systems Protection Board. The Office <span class=\"star-pagination\">*491</span> of Special Counsel investigated these complaints jointly and later terminated its investigation.</p>\n<p>After Carson filed a petition for a writ of mandamus regarding two complaints and moved to supplement it several times, the district court ordered him to file a single, definitive, amended petition. Carson filed an Amended Petition on November 20, 2008. The Office of Special Counsel moved to dismiss his Amended Petition on January 23, 2009. On February 9, Carson moved to amend his Amended Petition, seeking to add new claims about complaints MA-07-1668 and MA-08-1844. The district court granted the Office of Special Counsel's motion to dismiss and denied Carson leave to amend on May 11. Carson appeals.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. CARSON'S PETITION FOR A WRIT OF MANDAMUS</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Subject Matter Jurisdiction in General</h2>\n<p>A court of appeals \"must determine its own jurisdiction and is bound to do so in every instance.\" <i>Dickerson v. McClellan,</i> 37 F.3d 251, 252 (6th Cir.1994). We have jurisdiction over this appeal if the district court had jurisdiction over this action. <i>See </i><i>Weber v. United States,</i> 209 F.3d 756, 759 (D.C.Cir.2000). The district court effectively concluded that it had subject matter jurisdiction to issue a writ of mandamus if it determined that the Office of Special Counsel violated a non-discretionary duty to investigate Carson's allegations. We review a district court's findings as to whether it had subject matter jurisdiction de novo. <i>Willis v. Sullivan,</i> 931 F.2d 390, 395 (6th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p>Mandamus jurisdiction in federal courts is codified at 28 U.S.C. § 1361, which provides that \"[t]he district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any action in the nature of mandamus to compel an officer or employee of the United States or any agency thereof to perform a duty owed to the plaintiff.\" \"The existence of jurisdiction under section 1361 is inextricably bound with the merits of whether a writ of mandamus should issue; in order to establish either jurisdiction or entitlement to the writ, a court must find that a duty is owed to the plaintiff.\" <i>Maczko v. Joyce,</i> 814 F.2d 308, 310 (6th Cir.1987). \"[T]he remedy of mandamus is a drastic one, to be invoked only in extraordinary situations.\" <i>Allied Chem. Corp. v. Daiflon, Inc.,</i> 449 U.S. 33, 34, 101 S.Ct. 188, 66 L.Ed.2d 193 (1980). Mandamus is available only if: \"(1) the plaintiff has a clear right to relief; (2) the defendant has a clear duty to act; and (3) there is no other adequate remedy available to the plaintiff.\" <i>In re Medicare Reimbursement Litig.,</i> 414 F.3d 7, 10 (D.C.Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Mandamus is not an appropriate remedy if the action that the petitioner seeks to compel is discretionary. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Heckler v. Ringer,</i> 466 U.S. 602, 616, 104 S.Ct. 2013, 80 L.Ed.2d 622 (1984).</p>\n<p>We have never decided whether a district court may issue a writ of mandamus against the Office of Special Counsel for failure to investigate a claim. <i>See </i><i>Ryon v. O'Neill,</i> 894 F.2d 199, 205 n. 3 (6th Cir.1990) (stating that whether mandamus is available to enforce the Office of Special Counsel's investigatory duty is an \"open question\" in the Sixth Circuit). However, the District of Columbia Circuit has concluded that a district court does have subject matter jurisdiction to issue a writ of mandamus if it determines that the Office of Special Counsel violated a non-discretionary statutory duty to investigate an employee's allegations. <i>See </i><i>Weber,</i> 209 F.3d at 759. The District of Columbia Circuit reasoned that because the Federal <span class=\"star-pagination\">*492</span> Circuit has authority to review only Merit Systems Protection Board decisions and not Office of Special Counsel decisions, \"if district courts lacked power to issue the writ, judicial review of [Office of Special Counsel] actions would not be available.\" <i>Id.</i> Similarly, the Fifth Circuit has held that federal courts have authority to ensure that the Office of Special Counsel complies with its statutory obligations. <i>See </i><i>DeLeonardis v. Weiseman,</i> 986 F.2d 725, 727 (5th Cir.1993) (\"[A]n employee's right to obtain judicial review of the [Office of Special Counsel's] decision not to pursue a complaint is limited to [the question of] whether the [Office of Special Counsel] discharged its duty to investigate the complaint.\") (second alteration in original) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); <i>accord Nowick v. Strickland,</i> Nos. 98-1206, 98-1207, 98-1212, 1999 WL 282389, at *3 (10th Cir. Apr. 30, 1999) (noting its authority to ensure that the Office of Special Counsel complied with its statutory obligations); <i>Hyde v. Office of Special Counsel,</i> No. 94-1406, 1995 WL 238340, at *1 (10th Cir. Apr. 21, 1995) (same). We find the reasoning of our sister circuits persuasive and thus hold that a district court has subject matter jurisdiction to issue a writ of mandamus if it determines that the Office of Special Counsel violated a non-discretionary statutory duty to investigate an employee's allegations.</p>\n<p>However, this holding does not imply that district courts have jurisdiction to review all Office of Special Counsel determinations. Various courts have held that district courts have no jurisdiction to review the Office of Special Counsel's decision to terminate an investigation or not to petition the Merit Systems Protection Board. <i>See </i><i>DeLeonardis,</i> 986 F.2d at 727 (\"We agree with our colleagues of the D.C. Circuit that when the [Office of Special Counsel] decides to terminate an investigation that it began pursuant to a complaint, the decision is not reviewable.\"); <i>Wren v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.,</i> 681 F.2d 867, 876 n. 9 (D.C.Cir.1982) (\"It is also quite clear from the statutory language and corresponding legislative history that Congress did not mean to make the [Office of Special Counsel's] decisions to terminate or conduct an investigation or bring a proceeding before the Board reviewable on the merits.\"). In addition, several unpublished opinions have followed this approach. <i>See Hyde,</i> 1995 WL 238340, at *1 (holding that district courts have no authority to require the Office of Special Counsel to reconsider a complaint and resolve it a certain way); <i>DeLeonardis v. Koch,</i> Civ. A. No. H-90-3768, 1992 WL 465474, at *3 (S.D.Tex. July 1, 1992) (\"[A] district court may not review [Office of Special Counsel's] decision to terminate its investigation, or [Office of Special Counsel's] decision not to petition the [Merit Systems Protection Board].\") (citation omitted).</p>\n<p>Carson contends that this case is controlled by <i>Weber,</i> 209 F.3d at 759. In <i>Weber,</i> the plaintiff, a former Army employee, complained to the Office of Special Counsel that he had been stripped of a security clearance in retaliation for whistleblowing. <i>Id.</i> at 757. The Office of Special Counsel \"declined to investigate\" the plaintiff's complaint because it concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to investigate the complaint. <i>Id.</i> at 758. The plaintiff then sought a writ of mandamus to compel the Office of Special Counsel to investigate his accusation. <i>Id.</i> Thus, in both <i>Weber</i> and the present case, the Office of Special Counsel concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to investigate a complaint, and the plaintiff sought a writ of mandamus to compel it to investigate. In <i>Weber,</i> the district court held that \"there is no judicial review of the merits of the [Office of Special Counsel's] decision to dispense with an <span class=\"star-pagination\">*493</span> investigation.\" <i>Weber v. Office of Special Counsel,</i> No. 97-2260-LFO, slip op. at 6. (D.D.C. Feb. 10, 1999). Then, the District of Columbia Circuit held that a district court has subject matter jurisdiction to issue a writ of mandamus if it determines that the Office of Special Counsel violated a non-discretionary statutory duty to investigate an employee's allegations. <i>Weber,</i> 209 F.3d at 759. Because the Office of Special Counsel declined to investigate because it believed that it lacked jurisdiction, the District of Columbia Circuit appears to have held that the Office of Special Counsel's determinations of its own jurisdiction are subject to judicial review. <i>See id.</i></p>\n<p>We decline to rely on <i>Weber</i> to hold that district courts have authority to review the jurisdictional determinations of the Office of Special Counsel for a number of reasons. In this case the record indicates that the Office of Special Counsel conducted a preliminary investigation into Carson's claims. But it is unclear from the <i>Weber</i> decision whether the Office of Special Counsel initiated any investigation at all into the plaintiff's claim in that case.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>Additionally, to the extent that <i>Weber</i> holds that district courts have authority to review the jurisdictional determinations of the Office of Special Counsel, we find the Fifth Circuit's reasoning to the contrary to be more persuasive. In <i>DeLeonardis,</i> 986 F.2d at 727, the plaintiff argued that \"courts are allowed to look behind the agency's decision to terminate an investigation when . . . the agency applies the incorrect legal standard in deciding to terminate the investigation.\" The Fifth Circuit rejected this claim and stated that the plaintiff failed \"to recognize, or at least to admit, that to allow him to succeed on this argument we would have to vitiate the clearly established rule that we do not look behind substantive [Office of Special Counsel] determinations to terminate investigations.\" <i>Id.</i> Jurisdiction is a legal issue similar to the legal standard in dispute in <i>DeLeonardis.</i> Thus, we hold that a district court has subject matter jurisdiction to issue a writ of mandamus only if it determines that the Office of Special Counsel has declined to investigate a complaint at all; it has no subject matter jurisdiction to consider the Office of Special Counsel's jurisdictional determinations or the merits of its investigations. Now that we have established this main point, Carson's individual claims are easily resolved.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Complaints MA-08-1842, MA-08-1843, and MA-08-2553</h2>\n<p>The district court correctly concluded that it had no subject matter jurisdiction to issue a writ of mandamus regarding these three prohibited activity complaints. The Office of Special Counsel satisfies its statutory obligation when the Complaints Examining Unit conducts an initial investigation sufficient for it to determine whether a more thorough investigation is required. <i>Cf. </i><i>Wren,</i> 681 F.2d at 874 (discussing statutory language governing prohibited personnel practice complaints). Here, the Office of Special Counsel conducted a preliminary investigation of Carson's allegations and concluded that further inquiry was unnecessary because <span class=\"star-pagination\">*494</span> he did not allege violations of civil service laws, rules, or regulations. Carson does not contend that the Office of Special Counsel failed to investigate his complaint; he contends that the investigation was inadequate. District courts may not review the Office of Special Counsel's substantive decision to discontinue an investigation for lack of cause. Thus, the district court could not order the Office of Special Counsel to conduct an additional investigation into Carson's claims after the Office of Special Counsel conducted preliminary investigations and decided to close them. Because the Office of Special Counsel discharged its statutory obligations by investigating these three complaints, Carson is not entitled to a writ of mandamus. Thus, we AFFIRM the decision of the district court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. Section 1214(e) Reporting Requirement</h2>\n<p>5 U.S.C. § 1214(e) provides that:</p>\n<blockquote>If, in connection with any investigation under this subchapter, the Special Counsel determines that there is reasonable cause to believe that any violation of any law, rule, or regulation has occurred other than one referred to in subsection (b) or (d), the Special Counsel shall report such violation to the head of the agency involved.</blockquote>\n<p>Carson seeks a writ ordering the Office of Special Counsel to report the allegations that he raised in his complaints to the Secretary of Energy pursuant to section 1214(e). However, the district court correctly concluded that the Office of Special Counsel had no duty to report violations of law, rule, or regulation because the Office of Special Counsel never found that such violations had occurred.</p>\n<p>Carson asks us to resolve his disagreement with the Office of Special Counsel about the meaning of the phrase \"any law, rule, or regulation\" in section 1214(e). Carson suggests that the phrase applies to violations of law, rule, or regulation under the jurisdiction of the Office of Special Counsel. The Office of Special Counsel, on the other hand, asserts that the phrase applies to violations of law, rule, or regulation that it discovers during an investigation but over which it lacks jurisdiction under section 1214 or 1216. However, it is unnecessary for us to resolve this dispute because the Office of Special Counsel never found reasonable cause to believe that <i>any</i> violations of law, rule, or regulation occurred. Therefore, we have no authority to issue a purely advisory opinion on this debate. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>North Carolina v. Rice,</i> 404 U.S. 244, 246, 92 S.Ct. 402, 30 L.Ed.2d 413 (1971) (\"[F]ederal courts are without power to decide questions that cannot affect the rights of litigants in the case before them.\"). Thus, we AFFIRM the decision of the district court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. CARSON'S MOTION TO AMEND</h2>\n<p>Carson does not contest the merits of the district court's decisions regarding complaints MA-08-1844 and MA-07-1668.<sup>[2]</sup> Rather, he claims that the district court erred in denying his motion to amend the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*495</span> petition in light of the Office of Special Counsel's decision regarding these two complaints. Carson moved to amend his petition to add allegations that, in closing these two complaints, the Office of Special Counsel failed to comply with the requirements set out in a statutory note following section 1214. The district court found that Carson's additional allegations would be futile because the Office of Special Counsel had already performed the non-discretionary duties it owed Carson. Because the district court based its decision to deny leave to amend on the legal conclusion that amendment would be futile, we review this decision de novo. <i>Yuhasz v. Brush Wellman, Inc.,</i> 341 F.3d 559, 569 (6th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p>Leave to amend must be freely given when justice so requires. Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a). Nevertheless, leave to amend \"should be denied if the amendment is brought in bad faith, for dilatory purposes, results in undue delay or prejudice to the opposing party, or would be futile.\" <i>Crawford v. Roane,</i> 53 F.3d 750, 753 (6th Cir. 1995).</p>\n<p>The statutory note following section 1214 provides that:</p>\n<blockquote>The Special Counsel shall include in any letter terminating an investigation under section 1214(a)(2) of title 5, United States Code . . . the name and telephone number of an employee of the Special Counsel who is available to respond to reasonable questions from the person regarding the investigation or review conducted by the Special Counsel, the relevant facts ascertained by the Special Counsel, and the law applicable to the person's allegations.</blockquote>\n<p>United States Office of Special Counsel, Merit Systems Protection Board: Authorization, Pub. L. 103-424 § 12(b), 108 Stat. 4361, 4367 (1994). Carson contends that the person whose name and number he was given did not respond to his \"reasonable questions.\"</p>\n<p>For a writ of mandamus to be warranted, \"there must be a mandatory or ministerial obligation. If the alleged duty is discretionary or directory, the duty is not owed.\" <i>Maczko,</i> 814 F.2d at 310 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \"A duty is not owed unless the obligation is plainly defined and peremptory.\" <i>Id.</i> (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Although the Office of Special Counsel had a duty to comply with the statutory note following section 1214, the terms of that note are not readily ascertainable. \"[W]hen a duty is disputed or subject to various interpretations, . . . the duty is not `owed' in that the obligation to do a particular act cannot be said to be clear, peremptory, defined or ministerial within the meaning of section 1361.\" <i>Id.</i> There is clearly discretion involved in responding \"to reasonable questions from the person regarding the investigation or review conducted by the Special Counsel, the relevant facts ascertained by the Special Counsel, and the law applicable to the person's allegations.\" United States Office of Special Counsel, Merit Systems Protection Board: Authorization, Pub. L. 103-424 § 12(b), 108 Stat. 4361, 4367. Carson sought leave to amend his petition to request a writ of mandamus to enforce a statutory note that is subject to differing interpretations. This amendment would be futile because the district court would have no authority to issue the requested writ under section 1361.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, we note that because MA-08-1844 is a prohibited activity complaint, the procedural requirements of section 1214 do not apply to it in any case. Section 1216, which governs prohibited activity complaints, provides that \"[i]f the Special Counsel receives an allegation concerning [activities prohibited by any civil <span class=\"star-pagination\">*496</span> service law, rule, or regulation], the Special Counsel <i>may</i> investigate and seek corrective action under section 1214 and disciplinary action under section 1215 in the same way as if a prohibited personnel practice were involved.\" 5 U.S.C. § 1216(c) (emphasis added). The plain text of the statute suggests that the Office of Special Counsel is not required to provide status reports regarding prohibited activity allegations, but rather has this discretionary power. <i>See also </i><i>Perkins v. Office of Special Counsel,</i> 522 F.3d 1373, 1376 (Fed.Cir.2008) (\"[S]ubsection (c) of section 1216 specifies that [Office of Special Counsel] <i>may</i> seek corrective action under section 1214 . . . for activities described in [section 1216(a)(4)] in the same way as if a prohibited personnel practice were involved.\" (internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis added)). Thus, the district court correctly found that under section 1216, the Office of Special Counsel's decision whether to follow section 1214's procedural requirements was discretionary, and thus permitting Carson to amend his petition regarding a section 1216(a) investigation would be futile. Therefore, we AFFIRM the district court's denial of Carson's motion for leave to amend.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>We hold that a district court has subject matter jurisdiction to issue a writ of mandamus only if it determines that the Office of Special Counsel has declined to investigate a complaint at all; it has no subject matter jurisdiction to consider the Office of Special Counsel's jurisdictional determinations or the merits of its investigations. The district court had no subject matter jurisdiction to issue a writ of mandamus regarding complaints MA-08-1842, MA-08-1843, and MA-08-2553 because the Office of Special Counsel had fulfilled its statutory duty to investigate these complaints. The district court had no subject matter jurisdiction to issue a writ of mandamus to order the Office of Special Counsel to report allegations pursuant to section 1214(e) because the Office of Special Counsel never found that any violation of law, rule, or regulation occurred. Thus, we AFFIRM the district court's dismissal of Carson's claims.</p>\n<p>We find that because the section 1214 statutory note regarding responding to \"reasonable questions\" is subject to differing interpretations, the district court correctly found that permitting Carson to amend his petition would be futile. Thus, we AFFIRM the district court's dismissal of Carson's motion to amend.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The District of Columbia Circuit opinion states that the Office of Special Counsel had \"declined to investigate\" the complaint. <i>Weber,</i> 209 F.3d at 758. The district court's opinion initially states that the Office of Special Counsel \"decided not to pursue the complaint.\" But it later states that the Office of Special Counsel \"considered the plaintiff's complaint,\" and decided to \"dispense with an investigation.\" <i>Weber v. Office of Special Counsel,</i> No. 97-2260-LFO, slip op. at 2, 4, and 6. (D.D.C. Feb. 10, 1999). Thus, it is somewhat unclear whether the Office of Special Counsel declined to investigate the plaintiff's complaint at all or merely declined to continue its initial investigation.</p>\n<p>[2]  The district court correctly dismissed Carson's claim that the Office of Special Counsel was required to provide him status reports regarding complaint MA-08-1844, a prohibited activity complaint, because the Office of Special Counsel is not required to provide status reports regarding prohibited activity complaints under section 1214. The district court correctly dismissed Carson's claim regarding MA-07-1668, a prohibited personnel practice complaint, because the Office of Special Counsel performed its duty to make a \"reasonable basis\" determination under section 1214 by explaining its basis for proposing to close his complaint, reviewing Carson's written comments to this proposal, and later terminating its investigation and closing the complaint.</p>\n\n</div>",

Harber, Assistant United States Attorney, Knoxville, Tennessee, for Appellee. Joseph P. Carson, Knoxville, Tennessee, pro se. David B. Nolan, Alexandria, Virginia, for Amici Curiae.</p>\n<p>Before: MARTIN, BOGGS, and COOK, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>OPINION</h2>\n<p>BOYCE F. MARTIN, JR., Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>Pro se litigant Joseph P. Carson sought a writ of mandamus to compel the Office of Special Counsel to investigate complaints that he filed and to make reports to the Department of Energy. The district court dismissed his action and denied his motion to amend his complaint. We AFFIRM the decision of the district court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Carson is employed as a nuclear safety engineer at the Department of Energy. Since 1992, he has filed twenty-five complaints with the Office of Special Counsel, an independent investigatory and prosecutorial agency that is charged with, among other things, investigating complaints under the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989, Pub. L. No. 101-12, 103 Stat. 16 (codified in scattered sections of 5 U.S.C.). Carson also has filed six mandamus actions against the Office of Special Counsel, five of which have been filed in and dismissed by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. He filed the instant lawsuit in August 2008, seeking an order compelling the Office of Special Counsel to investigate complaints that he filed and to make reports to the Department of Energy.</p>\n<p>The Office of Special Counsel investigates two kinds of complaints filed by federal employees that are relevant to this case. First, it \"shall receive any allegation of a prohibited personnel practice and shall investigate the allegation to the extent necessary to determine whether there are reasonable grounds to believe that a prohibited personnel practice has occurred.\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*490</span> 5 U.S.C. § 1214(a)(1)(A) (1994). Under the Act, it is a \"prohibited personnel practice\" for a government agency to take a \"personnel action\" against an employee because of his disclosure of illegal activity or of \"gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, . . . or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety.\" <i>Id.</i> § 2302(b)(8). Second, the Office of Special Counsel \"shall . . . conduct an investigation of any allegation concerning . . . activities prohibited by any civil service law, rule, or regulation.\" <i>Id.</i> § 1216(a)(4).</p>\n<p>An employee who wishes to report a prohibited personnel practice or prohibited activity must first complain to the Office of Special Counsel. <i>See</i> 5 C.F.R. § 1800.1(c)(1) (2010). The initial investigation into both these types of complaints is conducted by the Office of Special Counsel's Complaints Examining Unit. <i>See id.</i> § 1800.1(c)(4). After an initial investigation, the Unit either refers the complaint to the Investigation and Prosecution Division or closes the complaint.</p>\n<p>Section 1214 provides additional procedures governing the investigation of prohibited personnel practices. While an investigation is pending, the Office of Special Counsel must provide written status updates to the complainant. <i>See</i> 5 U.S.C. § 1214(a)(1)(C). If the Office of Special Counsel determines that a prohibited personnel practice has occurred, it must report its findings to the Merit Systems Protection Board, and it may petition the Board to take action on behalf of the employee. <i>See id.</i> § 1214(b)(2)(B)-(C). Even if the Office of Special Counsel's investigation does not support the employee's complaint, the employee still may bring an individual action before the Merit Systems Protection Board. <i>See id.</i> § 1221. In either case, the decision of the Merit Systems Protection Boardbut not that of the Office of Special Counselis appealable to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. <i>See id.</i> § 7703.</p>\n<p>Unlike the mandatory procedures governing prohibited personnel practice complaints, section 1216, which governs prohibited activity complaints, provides that \"[i]f the Special Counsel receives an allegation concerning any matter under [section 1216(a)(4)], the Special Counsel <i>may</i> investigate and seek corrective action under section 1214 and disciplinary action under section 1215 in the same way as if a prohibited personnel practice were involved.\" <i>Id.</i> § 1216(c) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>This appeal involves five complaints made by Carson: four prohibited activity complaints, and one prohibited personnel practice complaint.</p>\n<p>Complaints MA-08-1842, MA-08-1843, and MA-08-2553 allege various prohibited activities. MA-08-1842 alleges that the Department of Energy materially breached a settlement agreement. MA-08-1843 alleges that the Department of Energy violated its grievance policy and procedures in failing to process several grievances that Carson presented. MA-08-2553 alleges that Carson's managers and colleagues violated a Department of Energy Order in making false statements about him. The Complaints Examining Unit investigated each of these complaints by reviewing the information that Carson provided and conducting legal research. The Office of Special Counsel terminated the investigations because it found that there was insufficient evidence of any activities prohibited by civil service law, rule, or regulation to warrant further action.</p>\n<p>Complaint MA-08-1844, a prohibited activity complaint, and complaint MA-07-1668, a prohibited personnel practice complaint, both allege that the Department of Energy delayed nine months in providing Carson corrective action ordered by the Merit Systems Protection Board. The Office <span class=\"star-pagination\">*491</span> of Special Counsel investigated these complaints jointly and later terminated its investigation.</p>\n<p>After Carson filed a petition for a writ of mandamus regarding two complaints and moved to supplement it several times, the district court ordered him to file a single, definitive, amended petition. Carson filed an Amended Petition on November 20, 2008. The Office of Special Counsel moved to dismiss his Amended Petition on January 23, 2009. On February 9, Carson moved to amend his Amended Petition, seeking to add new claims about complaints MA-07-1668 and MA-08-1844. The district court granted the Office of Special Counsel's motion to dismiss and denied Carson leave to amend on May 11. Carson appeals.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. CARSON'S PETITION FOR A WRIT OF MANDAMUS</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Subject Matter Jurisdiction in General</h2>\n<p>A court of appeals \"must determine its own jurisdiction and is bound to do so in every instance.\" <i>Dickerson v. McClellan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"679559\"><a href=\"/opinion/679559/chad-timothy-dickerson-deon-denay-dickerson-a-minor-by-her-mother-legal/\"><span class=\"volume\">37</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">251</span></a></span>, 252 (6th Cir.1994). We have jurisdiction over this appeal if the district court had jurisdiction over this action. <i>See </i><i>Weber v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"185126\"><a href=\"/opinion/185126/weber-calvin-j-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">209</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">756</span></a></span>, 759 (D.C.Cir.2000). The district court effectively concluded that it had subject matter jurisdiction to issue a writ of mandamus if it determined that the Office of Special Counsel violated a non-discretionary duty to investigate Carson's allegations. We review a district court's findings as to whether it had subject matter jurisdiction de novo. <i>Willis v. Sullivan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"559915\"><a href=\"/opinion/559915/dorothy-willis-88-58555857-89-6297-cross-appellee-88-6192-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">931</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">390</span></a></span>, 395 (6th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p>Mandamus jurisdiction in federal courts is codified at 28 U.S.C. § 1361, which provides that \"[t]he district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any action in the nature of mandamus to compel an officer or employee of the United States or any agency thereof to perform a duty owed to the plaintiff.\" \"The existence of jurisdiction under section 1361 is inextricably bound with the merits of whether a writ of mandamus should issue; in order to establish either jurisdiction or entitlement to the writ, a court must find that a duty is owed to the plaintiff.\" <i>Maczko v. Joyce,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"484984\"><a href=\"/opinion/484984/43-fair-emplpraccas-481-42-empl-prac-dec-p-36979-carol-maczko-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">814</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">308</span></a></span>, 310 (6th Cir.1987). \"[T]he remedy of mandamus is a drastic one, to be invoked only in extraordinary situations.\" <i>Allied Chem. Corp. v. Daiflon, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110354\"><a href=\"/opinion/110354/allied-chemical-corp-v-daiflon-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">449</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">33</span></a></span>, 34, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110354\"><a href=\"/opinion/110354/allied-chemical-corp-v-daiflon-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">193</span></a></span> (1980). Mandamus is available only if: \"(1) the plaintiff has a clear right to relief; (2) the defendant has a clear duty to act; and (3) there is no other adequate remedy available to the plaintiff.\" <i>In re Medicare Reimbursement Litig.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"186517\"><a href=\"/opinion/186517/in-re-medicare-reim/\"><span class=\"volume\">414</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">7</span></a></span>, 10 (D.C.Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Mandamus is not an appropriate remedy if the action that the petitioner seeks to compel is discretionary. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Heckler v. Ringer,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111168\"><a href=\"/opinion/111168/heckler-v-ringer/\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">602</span></a></span>, 616, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111168\"><a href=\"/opinion/111168/heckler-v-ringer/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">622</span></a></span> (1984).</p>\n<p>We have never decided whether a district court may issue a writ of mandamus against the Office of Special Counsel for failure to investigate a claim. <i>See </i><i>Ryon v. O'Neill,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"535288\"><a href=\"/opinion/535288/51-fair-emplpraccas-1748-52-empl-prac-dec-p-39615-charles-r-ryon/\"><span class=\"volume\">894</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">199</span></a></span>, 205 n. 3 (6th Cir.1990) (stating that whether mandamus is available to enforce the Office of Special Counsel's investigatory duty is an \"open question\" in the Sixth Circuit). However, the District of Columbia Circuit has concluded that a district court does have subject matter jurisdiction to issue a writ of mandamus if it determines that the Office of Special Counsel violated a non-discretionary statutory duty to investigate an employee's allegations. <i>See </i><i>Weber,</i> 209 F.3d at 759. The District of Columbia Circuit reasoned that because the Federal <span class=\"star-pagination\">*492</span> Circuit has authority to review only Merit Systems Protection Board decisions and not Office of Special Counsel decisions, \"if district courts lacked power to issue the writ, judicial review of [Office of Special Counsel] actions would not be available.\" <i>Id.</i> Similarly, the Fifth Circuit has held that federal courts have authority to ensure that the Office of Special Counsel complies with its statutory obligations. <i>See </i><i>DeLeonardis v. Weiseman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"600752\"><a href=\"/opinion/600752/william-justin-deleonardis-v-mary-weiseman-special-counsel-office-of-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">986</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">725</span></a></span>, 727 (5th Cir.1993) (\"[A]n employee's right to obtain judicial review of the [Office of Special Counsel's] decision not to pursue a complaint is limited to [the question of] whether the [Office of Special Counsel] discharged its duty to investigate the complaint.\") (second alteration in original) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); <i>accord Nowick v. Strickland,</i> Nos. 98-1206, 98-1207, 98-1212, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1999</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">282389</span></span>, at *3 (10th Cir. Apr. 30, 1999) (noting its authority to ensure that the Office of Special Counsel complied with its statutory obligations); <i>Hyde v. Office of Special Counsel,</i> No. 94-1406, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1995</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">238340</span></span>, at *1 (10th Cir. Apr. 21, 1995) (same). We find the reasoning of our sister circuits persuasive and thus hold that a district court has subject matter jurisdiction to issue a writ of mandamus if it determines that the Office of Special Counsel violated a non-discretionary statutory duty to investigate an employee's allegations.</p>\n<p>However, this holding does not imply that district courts have jurisdiction to review all Office of Special Counsel determinations. Various courts have held that district courts have no jurisdiction to review the Office of Special Counsel's decision to terminate an investigation or not to petition the Merit Systems Protection Board. <i>See </i><i>DeLeonardis,</i> 986 F.2d at 727 (\"We agree with our colleagues of the D.C. Circuit that when the [Office of Special Counsel] decides to terminate an investigation that it began pursuant to a complaint, the decision is not reviewable.\"); <i>Wren v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"405903\"><a href=\"/opinion/405903/celia-a-wren-v-merit-systems-protection-board/\"><span class=\"volume\">681</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">867</span></a></span>, 876 n. 9 (D.C.Cir.1982) (\"It is also quite clear from the statutory language and corresponding legislative history that Congress did not mean to make the [Office of Special Counsel's] decisions to terminate or conduct an investigation or bring a proceeding before the Board reviewable on the merits.\"). In addition, several unpublished opinions have followed this approach. <i>See Hyde,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1995</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">238340</span></span>, at *1 (holding that district courts have no authority to require the Office of Special Counsel to reconsider a complaint and resolve it a certain way); <i>DeLeonardis v. Koch,</i> Civ. A. No. H-90-3768, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1992</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">465474</span></span>, at *3 (S.D.Tex. July 1, 1992) (\"[A] district court may not review [Office of Special Counsel's] decision to terminate its investigation, or [Office of Special Counsel's] decision not to petition the [Merit Systems Protection Board].\") (citation omitted).</p>\n<p>Carson contends that this case is controlled by <i>Weber,</i> 209 F.3d at 759. In <i>Weber,</i> the plaintiff, a former Army employee, complained to the Office of Special Counsel that he had been stripped of a security clearance in retaliation for whistleblowing. <i>Id.</i> at 757. The Office of Special Counsel \"declined to investigate\" the plaintiff's complaint because it concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to investigate the complaint. <i>Id.</i> at 758. The plaintiff then sought a writ of mandamus to compel the Office of Special Counsel to investigate his accusation. <i>Id.</i> Thus, in both <i>Weber</i> and the present case, the Office of Special Counsel concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to investigate a complaint, and the plaintiff sought a writ of mandamus to compel it to investigate. In <i>Weber,</i> the district court held that \"there is no judicial review of the merits of the [Office of Special Counsel's] decision to dispense with an <span class=\"star-pagination\">*493</span> investigation.\" <i>Weber v. Office of Special Counsel,</i> No. 97-2260-LFO, slip op. at 6. (D.D.C. Feb. 10, 1999). Then, the District of Columbia Circuit held that a district court has subject matter jurisdiction to issue a writ of mandamus if it determines that the Office of Special Counsel violated a non-discretionary statutory duty to investigate an employee's allegations. <i>Weber,</i> 209 F.3d at 759. Because the Office of Special Counsel declined to investigate because it believed that it lacked jurisdiction, the District of Columbia Circuit appears to have held that the Office of Special Counsel's determinations of its own jurisdiction are subject to judicial review. <i>See id.</i></p>\n<p>We decline to rely on <i>Weber</i> to hold that district courts have authority to review the jurisdictional determinations of the Office of Special Counsel for a number of reasons. In this case the record indicates that the Office of Special Counsel conducted a preliminary investigation into Carson's claims. But it is unclear from the <i>Weber</i> decision whether the Office of Special Counsel initiated any investigation at all into the plaintiff's claim in that case.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>Additionally, to the extent that <i>Weber</i> holds that district courts have authority to review the jurisdictional determinations of the Office of Special Counsel, we find the Fifth Circuit's reasoning to the contrary to be more persuasive. In <i>DeLeonardis,</i> 986 F.2d at 727, the plaintiff argued that \"courts are allowed to look behind the agency's decision to terminate an investigation when . . . the agency applies the incorrect legal standard in deciding to terminate the investigation.\" The Fifth Circuit rejected this claim and stated that the plaintiff failed \"to recognize, or at least to admit, that to allow him to succeed on this argument we would have to vitiate the clearly established rule that we do not look behind substantive [Office of Special Counsel] determinations to terminate investigations.\" <i>Id.</i> Jurisdiction is a legal issue similar to the legal standard in dispute in <i>DeLeonardis.</i> Thus, we hold that a district court has subject matter jurisdiction to issue a writ of mandamus only if it determines that the Office of Special Counsel has declined to investigate a complaint at all; it has no subject matter jurisdiction to consider the Office of Special Counsel's jurisdictional determinations or the merits of its investigations. Now that we have established this main point, Carson's individual claims are easily resolved.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Complaints MA-08-1842, MA-08-1843, and MA-08-2553</h2>\n<p>The district court correctly concluded that it had no subject matter jurisdiction to issue a writ of mandamus regarding these three prohibited activity complaints. The Office of Special Counsel satisfies its statutory obligation when the Complaints Examining Unit conducts an initial investigation sufficient for it to determine whether a more thorough investigation is required. <i>Cf. </i><i>Wren,</i> 681 F.2d at 874 (discussing statutory language governing prohibited personnel practice complaints). Here, the Office of Special Counsel conducted a preliminary investigation of Carson's allegations and concluded that further inquiry was unnecessary because <span class=\"star-pagination\">*494</span> he did not allege violations of civil service laws, rules, or regulations. Carson does not contend that the Office of Special Counsel failed to investigate his complaint; he contends that the investigation was inadequate. District courts may not review the Office of Special Counsel's substantive decision to discontinue an investigation for lack of cause. Thus, the district court could not order the Office of Special Counsel to conduct an additional investigation into Carson's claims after the Office of Special Counsel conducted preliminary investigations and decided to close them. Because the Office of Special Counsel discharged its statutory obligations by investigating these three complaints, Carson is not entitled to a writ of mandamus. Thus, we AFFIRM the decision of the district court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. Section 1214(e) Reporting Requirement</h2>\n<p>5 U.S.C. § 1214(e) provides that:</p>\n<blockquote>If, in connection with any investigation under this subchapter, the Special Counsel determines that there is reasonable cause to believe that any violation of any law, rule, or regulation has occurred other than one referred to in subsection (b) or (d), the Special Counsel shall report such violation to the head of the agency involved.</blockquote>\n<p>Carson seeks a writ ordering the Office of Special Counsel to report the allegations that he raised in his complaints to the Secretary of Energy pursuant to section 1214(e). However, the district court correctly concluded that the Office of Special Counsel had no duty to report violations of law, rule, or regulation because the Office of Special Counsel never found that such violations had occurred.</p>\n<p>Carson asks us to resolve his disagreement with the Office of Special Counsel about the meaning of the phrase \"any law, rule, or regulation\" in section 1214(e). Carson suggests that the phrase applies to violations of law, rule, or regulation under the jurisdiction of the Office of Special Counsel. The Office of Special Counsel, on the other hand, asserts that the phrase applies to violations of law, rule, or regulation that it discovers during an investigation but over which it lacks jurisdiction under section 1214 or 1216. However, it is unnecessary for us to resolve this dispute because the Office of Special Counsel never found reasonable cause to believe that <i>any</i> violations of law, rule, or regulation occurred. Therefore, we have no authority to issue a purely advisory opinion on this debate. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>North Carolina v. Rice,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108413\"><a href=\"/opinion/108413/north-carolina-v-rice/\"><span class=\"volume\">404</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">244</span></a></span>, 246, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108413\"><a href=\"/opinion/108413/north-carolina-v-rice/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">413</span></a></span> (1971) (\"[F]ederal courts are without power to decide questions that cannot affect the rights of litigants in the case before them.\"). Thus, we AFFIRM the decision of the district court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. CARSON'S MOTION TO AMEND</h2>\n<p>Carson does not contest the merits of the district court's decisions regarding complaints MA-08-1844 and MA-07-1668.<sup>[2]</sup> Rather, he claims that the district court erred in denying his motion to amend the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*495</span> petition in light of the Office of Special Counsel's decision regarding these two complaints. Carson moved to amend his petition to add allegations that, in closing these two complaints, the Office of Special Counsel failed to comply with the requirements set out in a statutory note following section 1214. The district court found that Carson's additional allegations would be futile because the Office of Special Counsel had already performed the non-discretionary duties it owed Carson. Because the district court based its decision to deny leave to amend on the legal conclusion that amendment would be futile, we review this decision de novo. <i>Yuhasz v. Brush Wellman, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"783325\"><a href=\"/opinion/783325/richard-m-yuhasz-v-brush-wellman-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">341</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">559</span></a></span>, 569 (6th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p>Leave to amend must be freely given when justice so requires. Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a). Nevertheless, leave to amend \"should be denied if the amendment is brought in bad faith, for dilatory purposes, results in undue delay or prejudice to the opposing party, or would be futile.\" <i>Crawford v. Roane,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"695180\"><a href=\"/opinion/695180/lloyd-v-crawford-iii-v-jack-a-roane/\"><span class=\"volume\">53</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">750</span></a></span>, 753 (6th Cir. 1995).</p>\n<p>The statutory note following section 1214 provides that:</p>\n<blockquote>The Special Counsel shall include in any letter terminating an investigation under section 1214(a)(2) of title 5, United States Code . . . the name and telephone number of an employee of the Special Counsel who is available to respond to reasonable questions from the person regarding the investigation or review conducted by the Special Counsel, the relevant facts ascertained by the Special Counsel, and the law applicable to the person's allegations.</blockquote>\n<p>United States Office of Special Counsel, Merit Systems Protection Board: Authorization, Pub. L. 103-424 § 12(b), 108 Stat. 4361, 4367 (1994). Carson contends that the person whose name and number he was given did not respond to his \"reasonable questions.\"</p>\n<p>For a writ of mandamus to be warranted, \"there must be a mandatory or ministerial obligation. If the alleged duty is discretionary or directory, the duty is not owed.\" <i>Maczko,</i> 814 F.2d at 310 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \"A duty is not owed unless the obligation is plainly defined and peremptory.\" <i>Id.</i> (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Although the Office of Special Counsel had a duty to comply with the statutory note following section 1214, the terms of that note are not readily ascertainable. \"[W]hen a duty is disputed or subject to various interpretations, . . . the duty is not `owed' in that the obligation to do a particular act cannot be said to be clear, peremptory, defined or ministerial within the meaning of section 1361.\" <i>Id.</i> There is clearly discretion involved in responding \"to reasonable questions from the person regarding the investigation or review conducted by the Special Counsel, the relevant facts ascertained by the Special Counsel, and the law applicable to the person's allegations.\" United States Office of Special Counsel, Merit Systems Protection Board: Authorization, Pub. L. 103-424 § 12(b), 108 Stat. 4361, 4367. Carson sought leave to amend his petition to request a writ of mandamus to enforce a statutory note that is subject to differing interpretations. This amendment would be futile because the district court would have no authority to issue the requested writ under section 1361.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, we note that because MA-08-1844 is a prohibited activity complaint, the procedural requirements of section 1214 do not apply to it in any case. Section 1216, which governs prohibited activity complaints, provides that \"[i]f the Special Counsel receives an allegation concerning [activities prohibited by any civil <span class=\"star-pagination\">*496</span> service law, rule, or regulation], the Special Counsel <i>may</i> investigate and seek corrective action under section 1214 and disciplinary action under section 1215 in the same way as if a prohibited personnel practice were involved.\" 5 U.S.C. § 1216(c) (emphasis added). The plain text of the statute suggests that the Office of Special Counsel is not required to provide status reports regarding prohibited activity allegations, but rather has this discretionary power. <i>See also </i><i>Perkins v. Office of Special Counsel,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">522</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1373</span></span>, 1376 (Fed.Cir.2008) (\"[S]ubsection (c) of section 1216 specifies that [Office of Special Counsel] <i>may</i> seek corrective action under section 1214 . . . for activities described in [section 1216(a)(4)] in the same way as if a prohibited personnel practice were involved.\" (internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis added)). Thus, the district court correctly found that under section 1216, the Office of Special Counsel's decision whether to follow section 1214's procedural requirements was discretionary, and thus permitting Carson to amend his petition regarding a section 1216(a) investigation would be futile. Therefore, we AFFIRM the district court's denial of Carson's motion for leave to amend.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>We hold that a district court has subject matter jurisdiction to issue a writ of mandamus only if it determines that the Office of Special Counsel has declined to investigate a complaint at all; it has no subject matter jurisdiction to consider the Office of Special Counsel's jurisdictional determinations or the merits of its investigations. The district court had no subject matter jurisdiction to issue a writ of mandamus regarding complaints MA-08-1842, MA-08-1843, and MA-08-2553 because the Office of Special Counsel had fulfilled its statutory duty to investigate these complaints. The district court had no subject matter jurisdiction to issue a writ of mandamus to order the Office of Special Counsel to report allegations pursuant to section 1214(e) because the Office of Special Counsel never found that any violation of law, rule, or regulation occurred. Thus, we AFFIRM the district court's dismissal of Carson's claims.</p>\n<p>We find that because the section 1214 statutory note regarding responding to \"reasonable questions\" is subject to differing interpretations, the district court correctly found that permitting Carson to amend his petition would be futile. Thus, we AFFIRM the district court's dismissal of Carson's motion to amend.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The District of Columbia Circuit opinion states that the Office of Special Counsel had \"declined to investigate\" the complaint. <i>Weber,</i> 209 F.3d at 758. The district court's opinion initially states that the Office of Special Counsel \"decided not to pursue the complaint.\" But it later states that the Office of Special Counsel \"considered the plaintiff's complaint,\" and decided to \"dispense with an investigation.\" <i>Weber v. Office of Special Counsel,</i> No. 97-2260-LFO, slip op. at 2, 4, and 6. (D.D.C. Feb. 10, 1999). Thus, it is somewhat unclear whether the Office of Special Counsel declined to investigate the plaintiff's complaint at all or merely declined to continue its initial investigation.</p>\n<p>[2]  The district court correctly dismissed Carson's claim that the Office of Special Counsel was required to provide him status reports regarding complaint MA-08-1844, a prohibited activity complaint, because the Office of Special Counsel is not required to provide status reports regarding prohibited activity complaints under section 1214. The district court correctly dismissed Carson's claim regarding MA-07-1668, a prohibited personnel practice complaint, because the Office of Special Counsel performed its duty to make a \"reasonable basis\" determination under section 1214 by explaining its basis for proposing to close his complaint, reviewing Carson's written comments to this proposal, and later terminating its investigation and closing the complaint.</p>\n\n</div>",
