Defendant Timothy McNerney appeals his sentence of\n120 months of incarceration, followed by 10 years of supervised release. The district\ncourt sentenced Defendant on August 12, 2009 following Defendant’s guilty plea to one\n\n                                          1\n\fNo. 09-4011        United States v. McNerney                                       Page 2\n\n\ncount of receiving and distributing visual depictions of real minors engaged in sexually\nexplicit conduct in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2252(a)(2), and one count of possession of\nchild pornography in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2252A(a)(5)(B).\n\n       For the reasons stated below, we AFFIRM the district court’s decision.\n\n                                   BACKGROUND\n\n       On February 20, 2007, federal agents obtained a valid search warrant to search\nDefendant Timothy McNerney’s house based on a federal task force agent’s\ndetermination, through an internet search, that Defendant was sharing 166 files depicting\nchild pornography online via a peer-to-peer file-sharing program. Pursuant to this valid\nsearch warrant, federal agents searched Defendant’s house, and seized Defendant’s\ncomputer. A forensic analysis of Defendant’s computer revealed that the file-sharing\nprogram was installed on Defendant’s computer, and that numerous images of child\npornography were located in the shared folder, allowing other users of the file-sharing\nprogram to access them. The agents also found that Defendant had backed up his files\non a second hard drive, creating an identical second copy of all of the data contained on\nhis computer, including the images of child pornography.\n\n       A federal grand jury indicted Defendant on December 10, 2008, for receiving and\ndistributing visual depictions of real minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct in\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 2252(a)(2), and possession of child pornography in violation of\n18 U.S.C. § 2252A(a)(5)(B). On April 22, 2009, Defendant pled guilty to both counts\nof the indictment. On August 13, 2009, the district court held a sentencing hearing, and\nsentenced Defendant to an 120 month term of imprisonment, followed by 10 years of\nsupervised release.\n\n       At the sentencing hearing the district court calculated Defendant’s total offense\nlevel at 30, and Defendant’s criminal history category at I, producing an advisory\nsentence range of 97 to 121 months. In calculating Defendant’s offense level, the district\ncourt began with a base offense level of 22, which both parties agreed was correct. The\ndistrict court proceeded to add the following enhancements: a two level enhancement for\n\fNo. 09-4011             United States v. McNerney                                                    Page 3\n\n\nimages of prepubescent minors pursuant to U.S.S.G § 2G2.2(ii); a two level\nenhancement for transferring materials over the internet pursuant to U.S.S.G\n§ 2G2.2(b)(3)(F); a two level enhancement for using a computer in the crime pursuant\nto U.S.S.G § 2G2.2(b)(6); and a five level enhancement for having more than 600\nimages pursuant to U.S.S.G § 2G2.2(b)(7), producing a total offense level of 33. The\ndistrict court then adjusted Defendant’s offense level for acceptance of responsibility,\nplacing Defendant’s final offense level at 30.\n\n         Regarding its computation of the number of images Defendant possessed, based\non which the district court enhanced Defendant’s offense level by five points, and which\nis disputed in this appeal, the district court stated:\n\n         [T]here’s a dispute about the number of images.1 The Probation\n         Department has recommended an additional five levels based on the\n         finding that there are more than 600 images, specifically 766. The\n         [D]efendant has argued that there’s double counting because there are\n         multiple copies of the same image and, therefore, those images should be\n         counted only once in reaching the total . . . . Mr. McNerney had two hard\n         drives and many of the images are found on both hard drives . . . .\n         [G]iven that as the government pointed out the computer automatically\n         creates a mirror image of the first hard drive on the second hard drive,\n         and so if hard drive number one is damaged or erased all the images\n         would still exist on the backup hard drive in pristine form, and in my\n         view then we have multiple images and it’s not double counting because\n         we’ve got two separate hard drives and this means if one were damaged,\n         the [D]efendant would still have them on the other hard drive. That’s the\n         only reason to have them on two hard drives, so I don’t believe it’s unfair\n         or inappropriate to count, you know, we have image A on hard drive one\n         and the same image is on hard drive two, we have two separate images\n         and they could both be used and they are there in case one hard drive\n         crashes. So I don’t believe we have double counting, and given that,\n         there are more than 600 images in total and so the plus five applies.\n\n(R. 30, Tr. of Sentencing Proceeding at 4-5.)\n\n\n\n\n         1\n           Although the district court and the litigants are not clear on this point, thumbnail images are not\ncounted separately for U.S.S.G. § 2G2.2(b)(7) purposes because thumbnails are not duplicate digital\nimages. Rather, thumbnails are simply previews of digital images that are viewable without opening the\ndigital folder in which the digital images are contained.\n\fNo. 09-4011           United States v. McNerney                                                  Page 4\n\n\n         Defendant objected to the district court’s computation, and the five level\nenhancement under U.S.S.G § 2G2.2(b)(7). (Id. at 13-14.) Defendant timely appealed\nhis sentence.\n\n                                           DISCUSSION\n\n         I.       Standard of Review\n\n         We review “de novo a district court’s interpretation of the Sentencing\nGuidelines.” United States v. Gibson, 409 F.3d 325, 338 (6th Cir. 2005).\n\n         II.      Analysis\n\n         Defendant challenges the district court’s application of a five level enhancement\nto his offense level for possessing 600 or more images, pursuant to U.S.S.G\n§ 2G2.2(b)(7). Section 2G2.2(b)(7) of the Sentencing Guidelines provides for an\nincrease in a defendant’s offense level for child pornography based on the number of\nimages possessed as follows: “If the offense involved – (A) at least 10 images, but fewer\nthan 150, increase by 2 levels; (B) at least 150 images, but fewer than 300, increase by\n3 levels; (C) at least 300 images, but fewer than 600, increase by 4 levels; and (D) 600\nor more images, increase by 5 levels.”\n\n         Defendant contends that only unique digital images, not duplicate digital\nimages,2 should be counted in computing an enhancement under this provision of the\nSentencing Guidelines. This particular interpretive issue is a question of first impression\nfor this Court. There is also a dearth of case law on this question in other circuits.3\n\n         2\n           We use the term “digital image” to refer to any image saved on a digital medium, including, by\nway of example, a computer hard drive, a camera memory card, a flash drive, or the internet.\n         We use the term “duplicate digital image” to refer to an identical copy of a digital image.\n         We use the term “unique digital image” to refer to a digital image of which there are no\nduplicates.\n         We use the term “hard copy image” to refer to any printed image, including, by way of example,\na printed photograph, a picture in a magazine or book, or a videotape.\n         We use the term “duplicate hard copy image” to refer to an identical copy of a hard copy image.\n         We use the term “unique hard copy image” to refer to a hard copy image of which there are no\nduplicates.\n         3\n         Three cases have raised the issue at the federal appellate level, only one of which analyzed\nwhether duplicate digital images are counted for U.S.S.G. § 2G2.2(b)(7) purposes. See United States v.\nSampson, 606 F.3d 505 (8th Cir. 2010); United States v. Havens, 331 F. App’x 280, 282 (5th Cir. 2009)\n\fNo. 09-4011            United States v. McNerney                                                  Page 5\n\n\n                  A.       History of § 2G2.2\n\n         As noted by several of our sister circuits, Congress has taken an active role in\ncreating the sentencing scheme for child pornography offenses. See, e.g., United States\nv. Grober, 624 F.3d 592, 608 (3d Cir. 2010); United States v. Dorvee, 604 F.3d 84, 95\n(2d Cir. 2010). The Child Pornography Sentencing Guidelines are “fundamentally\ndifferent from most . . . . Sentencing Guidelines are typically developed by the\nSentencing Commission using an empirical approach based on data about past\nsentencing policies.” Dorvee, 604 F.3d at 95 (citing Rita v. United States, 551 U.S. 338,\n349 (2007)). However, “the Commission did not use this empirical approach in\nformulating the Guidelines for child pornography.” Id.\n\n         The Child Pornography Sentencing Guidelines “have been substantively\namended nine times since 1987.” Grober, 624 F.3d at 604. As Congress has placed a\n“laser-like focus on the child pornography Guidelines, particularly in the last several\nyears,” id., the Sentencing Commission’s amendments to the Child Pornography\nGuidelines have often been at Congress’ behest.\n\n         In its report entitled, “The History of the Child Pornography Guidelines,” issued\nin October 2009, the United States Sentencing Commission explained that “Congress has\nbeen particularly active over the last decade creating new offenses, increasing penalties,\nand issuing directives to the [Sentencing] Commission regarding child pornography\noffenses. Indeed, in 2008 [alone] the 110th Congress passed three new laws amending\nchild pornography statutes.” History of the Child Pornography Guidelines, Oct.2009,\nat 1, available at http://www.ussc.gov/Research/Research_Projects/Sex_Offenses/\n20091030_History_Child_Pornography_Guidelines.pdf (last visited Feb. 8, 2011).\nMoreover, Congress’ child pornography legislation initiatives have been unambiguously\nmotivated by a desire to cast a wider criminal net, and impose harsher punishments for\nchild pornography offenses. As the Second Circuit stated, “at the direction of Congress,\n\n\n(summarily dismissing the defendant’s argument that “there was evidence at trial that some of the images\nhe possessed were duplicates.”); United States v. Goff, 501 F.3d 250, 255 n.9 (3d Cir. 2007) (allowing the\nprosecution in that case to discount duplicate images for U.S.S.G. § 2G2.2(b)(7) purposes, although\nneither explicitly approving of this interpretation nor analyzing the Guidelines provision).\n\fNo. 09-4011         United States v. McNerney                                          Page 6\n\n\nthe Sentencing Commission has amended the Guidelines under § 2G2.2 several times\nsince their introduction in 1987, each time recommending harsher penalties.” Dorvee,\n604 F.3d at 95; see also Grober, 624 F.3d at 604-05 (stating that “[i]t is clear . . . that [in\nits several amendments to the Guidelines increasing penalties for child pornography] the\nCommission was constantly reacting to Congress’s (sic.) repeated directives, and the\npenalties for child pornography offenses that were steadily, and often dramatically,\nincreasing.”).\n\n        In its recent report, the Sentencing Commission elaborated, “Congress has\ndemonstrated its continued interest in deterring and punishing child pornography\noffenses, prompting the [Sentencing] Commission to respond to multiple public laws that\ncreated new child pornography offenses, increased criminal penalties, directly (and\nuniquely) amended the child pornography guidelines, and required the [Sentencing]\nCommission to consider offender and offense characteristics for the child pornography\nguidelines.” History of the Child Pornography Guidelines, supra, at 54. Specifically,\n\n        [f]or more than 30 years, and particularly in recent years, Congress has\n        focused attention on the scope of child pornography offenses and the\n        severity of penalties for child pornography offenders. Through creating\n        new offenses, enacting new mandatory minimums, increasing statutory\n        maximums, and providing directives to the [Sentencing] Commission,\n        Congress has repeatedly expressed its will regarding appropriate\n        penalties for child pornography offenders. Congress has specifically\n        expressed an intent to raise penalties associated with certain child\n        pornography offenses several times through directives to the Commission\n        and statutory changes aimed at increasing the guideline penalties and\n        reducing the incidence of downward departures for such offenses.\n\nId. at 6. See also United States v. Gellatly, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2693, at *15-24 (D.\nNeb. Jan. 5, 2009) (summarizing the history of child pornography legislation).\n\n        The Guidelines provision at issue in this case, § 2G2.2(b)(7), providing for a\nsentence enhancement of between two and five levels based on the number of images\ninvolved in the crime, was the direct product of one such Congressional initiative.\nCongress enacted the Prosecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to End the Exploitation\nof Children Today Act (“PROTECT Act”), which “made several changes with respect\n\fNo. 09-4011        United States v. McNerney                                       Page 7\n\n\nto the child pornography guidelines and contained provisions by which Congress for the\nfirst and only time to date, directly amended the guidelines.” Id. at 38. “The PROTECT\nAct of 2003 instructed the Commission to amend § 2G2.2 to include the number-of-\nimages enhancements, which are currently codified at § 2G2.2(b)(7) and range from two\nlevels to five levels.” Dorvee, 604 F.3d at 95 n.6. Thus, “[i]n 2003, pursuant to the\nProsecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to end the Exploitation of Children Today Act\n(“PROTECT Act”), the Commission again revised the guidelines covering child\npornography offenses,” and added the quantity of images enhancement mandated by the\nPROTECT Act. History of the Child Pornography Guidelines, supra, at 38.\n\n       Congress, in repeatedly enacting legislation regarding child pornography,\n“demonstrated its continued interest in deterring and punishing child pornography\noffenses.” Id. at 54. As one court explained,\n\n       [t]he clear focus of [the child pornography] legislation and concomitant\n       Guidelines revision is on the patent evils of child pornography and the\n       new dimension that computer technology adds to those evils. In\n       particular, the amendments to the Guidelines reflect Congressional\n       concerns that pedophiles, including those who use the Internet, are using\n       child pornographic and obscene material to desensitize children to sexual\n       activity, to convince children that sexual activity involving children is\n       normal, and to entice children to engage in sexual activity.\n\nGellatly, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2693, at * 24 (internal quotations and citations\nomitted). Simply put, Congress sought to protect “[t]he primary victims of the crime of\npossession of child pornography,” namely, “the exploited children.” Id.; see also\nConnection Distrib. Co. v. Holder, 557 F.3d 321, 324 (6th Cir. 2009) (en banc) (stating\nthat in enacting numerous pieces of legislation regarding child pornography, “Congress\n[was] attempt[ing] to prevent the exploitation of children through pornography.”).\n\n       Despite Congress’ significant purpose in prohibiting the dissemination of child\npornography, some courts and commentators have questioned the wisdom of the\ncongressionally-directed Child Pornography Sentencing Guideline because they were\nthe product of Congressional mandate rather than the Commission’s preferred\nsystematic, empirical approach. See, e.g., Grober, 624 F.3d at 608 (“§ 2G2.2 was not\n\fNo. 09-4011         United States v. McNerney                                        Page 8\n\n\ndeveloped pursuant to the Commission’s institutional role and based on empirical data\nand national experience, but instead was developed largely pursuant to congressional\ndirectives.”); Dorvee, 604 F.3d at 95, 97 (stating that the § 2G2.2 Guidelines are\n“fundamentally different from most and that, unless applied with great care, can lead to\nunreasonable sentences,” and describing § 2G2.2 as irrational); Gellatly, 2009 U.S. Dist.\nLEXIS 2693, at *10 (stating that in areas such as child pornography, “[w]hen Guidelines\nare not the result of the Commission’s exercise of its characteristic institutional role,\nsuch as when they are not based on an empirical approach, but are instead keyed to or\nguided by statutory directives . . . the Guideline ranges of imprisonment for those crimes\nare a less reliable appraisal of a fair sentence.”); (R. 21-3, Troy Stabenow,\nDeconstructing the Myth of Careful Study: A Primer on the Flawed Progression of the\nChild Pornography Guidelines at 3 (explaining that “the changes to the child\npornography guidelines are not the product of an empirically demonstrated need for\nconsistently tougher sentencing. Instead, these changes are largely the consequence of\nnumerous morality earmarks, slipped into larger bills over the last fifteen years, often\nwithout notice, debate, or empirical study of any kind.”).) However, the debate\nregarding the wisdom of congressionally-mandated enhancements notwithstanding, it\nis unquestionably Congress’ constitutional prerogative to issue sentencing directives\nsuch as the sentencing enhancements for quantity of images at issue in this case.\n\n        It is axiomatic that “[i]n our system, so far as at least concerns the federal\npowers, defining crimes and fixing penalties are legislative . . . functions.” United States\nv. Evans, 333 U.S. 483, 486 (1948). The Supreme Court has reiterated that “Congress,\nof course, has the power to fix the sentence for a federal crime.” Mistretta v. United\nStates, 488 U.S. 361, 364 (1989); see also United States v. Evanouskas, 386 F. App’x\n882, 884 (11th Cir. 2010). Thus, “[n]othwithstanding the delegation of authority\nprovided to the Commission in the [Sentencing Reform Act], Congress retained ultimate\nauthority over the federal sentencing guidelines . . . . Congress [thus] retains the ability\nto influence federal sentencing policy by enacting directives to the Commission,”\nHistory of the Child Pornography Guidelines, supra, at 5-6, “which the Commission is\nobliged to implement.” Grober, F.3d at 608.\n\fNo. 09-4011          United States v. McNerney                                       Page 9\n\n\n                B.       Interpretation of § 2G2.2(b)(7)\n\n        The Guidelines provision at issue in the instant appeal is U.S.S.G § 2G2.2(b)(7).\nIt provides for an increase in a defendant’s offense level for child pornography based on\nthe number of images possessed. Defendant challenges the application of the Guidelines\nto duplicate digital images. In his brief to this Court, Defendant admits that duplicate\nhard copy images are counted separately for § 2G2.2(b)(7) purposes. However,\nDefendant nevertheless argues that only unique digital images, not duplicate digital\nimages, should be counted in determining a sentencing enhancement under this\nGuideline provision.\n\n        As discussed above, § 2G2.2(b)(7) was properly enacted pursuant to explicit\ncongressional mandate, and congressional will should be considered in construing its\nparameters. In so doing, we note that congressional directives regarding sentencing for\nchild pornography have consistently increased penalties. We further note that although\nCongress has explicitly expressed its desire to enhance punishments for child\npornography offenses, Congress has not differentiated between digital images and hard\ncopy images for the purposes of § 2G2.2(b)(7) image enumeration.\n\n        Section 2G2.2(b)(7) provides for enhancements to a defendant’s sentence as\nfollows: “If the offense involved – (A) at least 10 images, but fewer than 150, increase\nby 2 levels; (B) at least 150 images, but fewer than 300, increase by 3 levels; (C) at least\n300 images, but fewer than 600, increase by 4 levels; and (D) 600 or more images,\nincrease by 5 levels.”\n\n        Like the congressional directive itself, the Application Note to § 2G2.2(b)(7) is\nsimilarly devoid of any indication that § 2G2.2(b)(7) differentiates between digital\nimages and hard copy images.\n\n        Application of Subsection (b)(7) –\n\n        (A) Definition of “images” – “Images” means any visual depiction, as\n        defined in 18 U.S.C. § 2256(5), that constitutes child pornography, as\n        defined in 18 U.S.C. § 2256(5).\n\fNo. 09-4011          United States v. McNerney                                   Page 10\n\n\n       (B) Determining the number of images:– For purposes of determining the\n       number of images under subsection (b)(7):\n               (i) Each photograph, picture, computer or computer-\n               generated image, or any similar visual depiction shall be\n               considered one image. If the number of images\n               substantially underrepresents the number of minors\n               involved, an upward departure may be warranted.\n\nU.S.S.G. § 2G2.2 Application Note 4. In defining the term “image,” the Application\nNote refers only to “any visual depiction.”       This suggests that duplicate visual\ndepictions, digital or otherwise, should each be counted separately for purposes of this\nenhancement.\n\n       Previous versions of the Child Pornography Sentencing Guidelines similarly\ntreated digital images and hard copy images equivalently. The Commission’s 2000\namendments to the Guidelines clarified that the enhancement then contained in\n§ 2G2.4(b)(2) providing for “a two-level enhancement if the offense involved possession\nof ten or more items of child pornography,” stated that a “computer file qualifies as an\nitem for purposes of the enhancement,” thus providing for identical treatment of digital\nimages and hard copy images. (R. 21-3, Troy Stabenow, Deconstructing the Myth of\nCareful Study: A Primer on the Flawed Progression of the Child Pornography\nGuidelines at 18.)\n\n       Defendant nevertheless attempts to distinguish duplicate hard copy images from\nduplicate digital images, stating: “the rationale underlying the increase in levels based\nupon the number of images is obvious: each picture represents a separate victimization\nof those pictured.” (Br. of Appellant at 9.) Defendant maintains, however, that duplicate\ndigital images, such as those contained on Defendant’s second hard drive, are not\n“multiple victimizations.” (Id.) Defendant argues that, as distinguished from duplicate\ndigital images, “there are practical reasons why [duplicate] hard copies could be treated\n[as multiple images]. Most obviously, because making [duplicate] hard copies requires\nmore than a minimal amount of effort, and having [duplicate] hard copies makes it\npossible to potentially distribute them.” (Id.)\n\fNo. 09-4011            United States v. McNerney                                                 Page 11\n\n\n         Defendant’s argument implies that digital images and hard copy images are\ndisseminated by dissimilar methods of distribution. In this vein, Defendant contends that\nit is significant that dissemination of hard copy images requires duplication. According\nto Defendant’s reasoning, duplicate hard copy images should be counted separately\npursuant to § 2G2.2(b)(7) inasmuch as the duplicates themselves are necessary for\ndissemination. However, this rationale does not similarly justify counting duplicate\ndigital images separately.\n\n         Digital distribution of child pornography is facilitated by file-sharing programs\nthat allow users to access other users’ computers to download shared digital images.\nOnce an individual uploads a single digital image onto the file-sharing platform, an\ninfinite number of users can access that digital image. Thus, possessing a duplicate\ndigital image does not affect the quantity of child pornography available for digital\ndistribution.\n\n         However, although the rationale for individual counting of duplicate hard copy\nimages does not extend to duplicate digital images, we remain mindful that the Child\nPornography Guidelines contain no indication that either Congress or the Sentencing\nCommission intended to differentiate between hard copy images and digital images. See\nU.S.S.G. § 2G2.2 Application Note 4.4\n\n         Moreover, it is significant that § 2G2.2(b)(7) applies to all of the following child\npornography crimes: trafficking in material involving the sexual exploitation of a minor;\n\n\n         4\n           The recent Eighth Circuit case United States v. Sampson, 606 F.3d 505 (8th Cir. 2010), is the\nonly case on the circuit level that we have identified which discusses whether duplicate digital images\nshould be counted for purposes of a § 2G2.2(b)(7) sentence enhancement. In Sampson the Eighth Circuit\nheld that § 2G2.2(b)(7) does not include a uniqueness requirement for counting digital images. The Eighth\nCircuit maintained that possessing duplicate digital images increases the supply of digital child\npornography, and therefore, duplicate digital images should be counted separately for purposes of a\n§ 2G2.2(b)(7) enhancement. See id. at 510.\n          However, although we agree with the Eighth Circuit’s holding in Sampson that duplicate digital\nimages should be counted for purposes of a § 2G2.2(b)(7) sentence enhancement, we disagree with its\nreasoning to the extent that it is premised on a misunderstanding of the methods used to distribute digital\nimages of child pornography. Possessing duplicate digital images does not affect the supply of digital\nchild pornography. An individual possessing a unique digital image can disseminate that single image as\nwidely as an individual possessing duplicate digital images. Once an individual uploads a digital image,\nan infinite number of people can download that single digital image. Therefore, possessing duplicate\ndigital images does not increase an individual’s capacity to facilitate wide dissemination of that digital\nimage.\n\fNo. 09-4011         United States v. McNerney                                       Page 12\n\n\nreceiving, transporting, shipping, soliciting, or advertising material involving the sexual\nexploitation of a minor; possessing material involving the sexual exploitation of a minor\nwith intent to traffic; and possessing material involving the sexual exploitation of a\nminor. See U.S.S.G. § 2G2.2(b)(7). The Guidelines provision applies equally to\ndistribution and possession of child pornography. Its applicability is not dependent on\na defendant’s capacity to distribute child pornography.           Thus, the rationale for\ndifferentiating between duplicate hard copy images and duplicate digital images based\non differences in distribution methods is not persuasive.\n\n        Furthermore, it is undisputed that § 2G2.2(b)(7) applies to possession of\nduplicate hard copy images, and that even in cases of simple possession of child\npornography we consider the quantity of images involved in the crime relevant to the\nmeasure of a defendant’s culpability. See United States v. Borho, 485 F.3d 904, 910 (6th\nCir. 2007); see also United States v. Acosta, 619 F.3d 956, 962 (8th Cir. 2010)\n(explaining that application of § 2G2.2(b)(7)(D) was proper in that case because\n“enhancing a defendant’s sentence for the number of illegal items with which he was\ninvolved is a common practice throughout the Guidelines”).              Therefore, neither\napplication nor interpretation of § 2G2.2(b)(7) is tied to facilitation of distributing child\npornography.\n\n        We therefore find that duplicate digital images, like duplicate hard copy images,\nshould be counted separately for purposes of calculating a sentence enhancement\npursuant to § 2G2.2(b)(7).\n\n        III.    Summary\n\n        The district court did not err by counting duplicate images in calculating\nDefendant’s U.S.S.G. § 2G2.2(b)(7) enhancement based on the number of images he\npossessed.\n\n                                     CONCLUSION\n\n        For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court’s decision.\n\fNo. 09-4011         United States v. McNerney                                      Page 13\n\n\n                                 ___________________\n\n                                   CONCURRENCE\n                                 ___________________\n\n        ROGERS, Circuit Judge, concurring. I concur in the result and in much of the\nreasoning of the majority opinion. Defendant makes the categorical argument in this\ncase that identical duplicate images may not be counted separately for the purposes of\ncalculating a sentencing enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 2G2.2(b)(7). For the\nreasons given in the majority opinion, we reject this argument.\n\n        To reject an argument that duplicate digital images are never to be counted\nseparately, however, does not require us to hold that they are always to be counted\nseparately. It is not necessary for us to decide that broader issue in order to resolve this\nappeal. Indeed, the Government concedes that certain “thumbnail” duplicate images\nneed not be separately counted. In the instant case, the duplicate images were in a\nback-up hard drive, thus decreasing the chance that the images would be lost. In that\nsense, the copies increase the likelihood of further distribution. In such a context, the\ndistrict court could properly count the digital images separately. It is not necessary for\nus to rule more broadly that duplicate images must be counted even when their presence\non the computer does not increase the likelihood of further distribution.\n\n        As a related matter, I think it may be misleading to say that “[p]ossessing\nduplicate digital images does not affect the supply of digital child pornography” and that\n“possessing duplicate digital images does not increase an individual’s capacity to\nfacilitate wide dissemination of that digital image.” Maj. Op. 12 n.4. While the\nindividual’s ultimate capacity to disseminate may be the same, the likelihood of\ndissemination is obviously greater in some cases than others. The present instance is a\ngood example: the existence of a back-up hard drive increases the risk that the images\nwill be preserved and later viewed by the user or someone else. Similarly, having\nduplicates in different folders versus the same folder, or in undeleted versus deleted\nstatus, can change the likelihood of dissemination.\n\f",

Thompson, Federal Public Defender's Office, Cleveland, Ohio, for Appellant. Carol M. Skutnik, Assistant United States Attorney, Cleveland, Ohio, for Appellee.</p>\n<p>Before: SUHRHEINRICH, CLAY, and ROGERS, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>CLAY, J., delivered the opinion of the court, in which SUHRHEINRICH, J., joined. ROGERS, J. (p. 781), delivered a separate concurring opinion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>OPINION</h2>\n<p>CLAY, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>Defendant Timothy McNerney appeals his sentence of 120 months of incarceration, followed by 10 years of supervised release. The district court sentenced Defendant on August 12, 2009 following Defendant's guilty plea to one count of receiving and distributing visual depictions of real minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2252(a)(2), and one count of possession of child pornography in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2252A(a)(5)(B).</p>\n<p>For the reasons stated below, we AFFIRM the district court's decision.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>On February 20, 2007, federal agents obtained a valid search warrant to search Defendant Timothy McNerney's house based on a federal task force agent's determination, through an internet search, that Defendant was sharing 166 files depicting child pornography online via a peer-to-peer file-sharing program. Pursuant to this valid search warrant, federal agents searched Defendant's house, and seized Defendant's computer. A forensic analysis of Defendant's computer revealed that the file-sharing program was installed on Defendant's computer, and that numerous images of child pornography were located <span class=\"star-pagination\">*774</span> in the shared folder, allowing other users of the file-sharing program to access them. The agents also found that Defendant had backed up his files on a second hard drive, creating an identical second copy of all of the data contained on his computer, including the images of child pornography.</p>\n<p>A federal grand jury indicted Defendant on December 10, 2008, for receiving and distributing visual depictions of real minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2252(a)(2), and possession of child pornography in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2252A(a)(5)(B). On April 22, 2009, Defendant pled guilty to both counts of the indictment. On August 13, 2009, the district court held a sentencing hearing, and sentenced Defendant to an 120 month term of imprisonment, followed by 10 years of supervised release.</p>\n<p>At the sentencing hearing the district court calculated Defendant's total offense level at 30, and Defendant's criminal history category at I, producing an advisory sentence range of 97 to 121 months. In calculating Defendant's offense level, the district court began with a base offense level of 22, which both parties agreed was correct. The district court proceeded to add the following enhancements: a two level enhancement for images of prepubescent minors pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 2G2.2(ii); a two level enhancement for transferring materials over the internet pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 2G2.2(b)(3)(F); a two level enhancement for using a computer in the crime pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 2G2.2(b)(6); and a five level enhancement for having more than 600 images pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 2G2.2(b)(7), producing a total offense level of 33. The district court then adjusted Defendant's offense level for acceptance of responsibility, placing Defendant's final offense level at 30.</p>\n<p>Regarding its computation of the number of images Defendant possessed, based on which the district court enhanced Defendant's offense level by five points, and which is disputed in this appeal, the district court stated:</p>\n<blockquote>[T]here's a dispute about the number of images.<sup>[1]</sup> The Probation Department has recommended an additional five levels based on the finding that there are more than 600 images, specifically 766. The [D]efendant has argued that there's double counting because there are multiple copies of the same image and, therefore, those images should be counted only once in reaching the total.... Mr. McNerney had two hard drives and many of the images are found on both hard drives.... [G]iven that as the government pointed out the computer automatically creates a mirror image of the first hard drive on the second hard drive, and so if hard drive number one is damaged or erased all the images would still exist on the backup hard drive in pristine form, and in my view then we have multiple images and it's not double counting because we've got two separate hard drives and this means if one were damaged, the [D]efendant would still have them on the other hard drive. That's the only reason to have them on two hard drives, so I don't believe it's unfair or inappropriate to count, you know, we have image A on hard drive one and the same image is on hard drive two, we have two separate images and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*775</span> they could both be used and they are there in case one hard drive crashes. So I don't believe we have double counting, and given that, there are more than 600 images in total and so the plus five applies.</blockquote>\n<p>(R. 30, Tr. of Sentencing Proceeding at 4-5.)</p>\n<p>Defendant objected to the district court's computation, and the five level enhancement under U.S.S.G. § 2G2.2(b)(7). (<i>Id.</i> at 13-14.) Defendant timely appealed his sentence.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>DISCUSSION</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. Standard of Review</h2>\n<p>We review \"<i>de novo</i> a district court's interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines.\" <i>United States v. Gibson,</i> 409 F.3d 325, 338 (6th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. Analysis</h2>\n<p>Defendant challenges the district court's application of a five level enhancement to his offense level for possessing 600 or more images, pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 2G2.2(b)(7). Section 2G2.2(b)(7) of the Sentencing Guidelines provides for an increase in a defendant's offense level for child pornography based on the number of images possessed as follows: \"If the offense involved(A) at least 10 images, but fewer than 150, increase by 2 levels; (B) at least 150 images, but fewer than 300, increase by 3 levels; (C) at least 300 images, but fewer than 600, increase by 4 levels; and (D) 600 or more images, increase by 5 levels.\"</p>\n<p>Defendant contends that only unique digital images, not duplicate digital images,<sup>[2]</sup> should be counted in computing an enhancement under this provision of the Sentencing Guidelines. This particular interpretive issue is a question of first impression for this Court. There is also a dearth of case law on this question in other circuits.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. History of § 2G2.2</h2>\n<p>As noted by several of our sister circuits, Congress has taken an active role in creating the sentencing scheme for child pornography offenses. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Grober,</i> 624 F.3d 592, 608 (3d Cir.2010); <i>United States v. Dorvee,</i> 604 F.3d 84, 95 (2d Cir.2010). The Child Pornography Sentencing Guidelines are \"fundamentally different from most.... Sentencing <span class=\"star-pagination\">*776</span> Guidelines are typically developed by the Sentencing Commission using an empirical approach based on data about past sentencing policies.\" <i>Dorvee,</i> 604 F.3d at 95 (citing <i>Rita v. United States,</i> 551 U.S. 338, 349, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007)). However, \"the Commission did not use this empirical approach in formulating the Guidelines for child pornography.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>The Child Pornography Sentencing Guidelines \"have been substantively amended nine times since 1987.\" <i>Grober,</i> 624 F.3d at 604. As Congress has placed a \"laser-like focus on the child pornography Guidelines, particularly in the last several years,\" <i>id.,</i> the Sentencing Commission's amendments to the Child Pornography Guidelines have often been at Congress' behest.</p>\n<p>In its report entitled, \"The History of the Child Pornography Guidelines,\" issued in October 2009, the United States Sentencing Commission explained that \"Congress has been particularly active over the last decade creating new offenses, increasing penalties, and issuing directives to the [Sentencing] Commission regarding child pornography offenses. Indeed, in 2008 [alone] the 110th Congress passed three new laws amending child pornography statutes.\" <i>History of the Child Pornography Guidelines,</i> Oct. 2009, at 1, available at http://www.ussc.gov/Research/ Research_Projects/Sex_Offenses/ 20091030_History_Child_Pornography_ Guidelines.pdf (last visited Feb. 8, 2011). Moreover, Congress' child pornography legislation initiatives have been unambiguously motivated by a desire to cast a wider criminal net, and impose harsher punishments for child pornography offenses. As the Second Circuit stated, \"at the direction of Congress, the Sentencing Commission has amended the Guidelines under § 2G2.2 several times since their introduction in 1987, each time recommending harsher penalties.\" <i>Dorvee,</i> 604 F.3d at 95; <i>see also </i><i>Grober,</i> 624 F.3d at 604-05 (stating that \"[i]t is clear ... that [in its several amendments to the Guidelines increasing penalties for child pornography] the Commission was constantly reacting to Congress's (sic.) repeated directives, and the penalties for child pornography offenses that were steadily, and often dramatically, increasing.\").</p>\n<p>In its recent report, the Sentencing Commission elaborated, \"Congress has demonstrated its continued interest in deterring and punishing child pornography offenses, prompting the [Sentencing] Commission to respond to multiple public laws that created new child pornography offenses, increased criminal penalties, directly (and uniquely) amended the child pornography guidelines, and required the [Sentencing] Commission to consider offender and offense characteristics for the child pornography guidelines.\" <i>History of the Child Pornography Guidelines, supra,</i> at 54. Specifically,</p>\n<blockquote>[f]or more than 30 years, and particularly in recent years, Congress has focused attention on the scope of child pornography offenses and the severity of penalties for child pornography offenders. Through creating new offenses, enacting new mandatory minimums, increasing statutory maximums, and providing directives to the [Sentencing] Commission, Congress has repeatedly expressed its will regarding appropriate penalties for child pornography offenders. Congress has specifically expressed an intent to raise penalties associated with certain child pornography offenses several times through directives to the Commission and statutory changes aimed at increasing the guideline penalties and reducing the incidence of downward departures for such offenses.</blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*777</span> <i>Id.</i> at 6. <i>See also </i><i>United States v. Gellatly,</i> 2009 WL 35166, at *4-6, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2693, at *15-24 (D.Neb. Jan. 5, 2009) (summarizing the history of child pornography legislation).</p>\n<p>The Guidelines provision at issue in this case, § 2G2.2(b)(7), providing for a sentence enhancement of between two and five levels based on the number of images involved in the crime, was the direct product of one such Congressional initiative. Congress enacted the Prosecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to End the Exploitation of Children Today Act (\"PROTECT Act\"), which \"made several changes with respect to the child pornography guidelines and contained provisions by which Congress for the first and only time to date, directly amended the guidelines.\" <i>Id.</i> at 38. \"The PROTECT Act of 2003 instructed the Commission to amend § 2G2.2 to include the number-of-images enhancements, which are currently codified at § 2G2.2(b)(7) and range from two levels to five levels.\" <i>Dorvee,</i> 604 F.3d at 95 n. 6. Thus, \"[i]n 2003, pursuant to the Prosecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to end the Exploitation of Children Today Act (\"PROTECT Act\"), the Commission again revised the guidelines covering child pornography offenses,\" and added the quantity of images enhancement mandated by the PROTECT Act. <i>History of the Child Pornography Guidelines, supra,</i> at 38.</p>\n<p>Congress, in repeatedly enacting legislation regarding child pornography, \"demonstrated its continued interest in deterring and punishing child pornography offenses.\" <i>Id.</i> at 54. As one court explained,</p>\n<blockquote>[t]he clear focus of [the child pornography] legislation and concomitant Guidelines revision is on the patent evils of child pornography and the new dimension that computer technology adds to those evils. In particular, the amendments to the Guidelines reflect Congressional concerns that pedophiles, including those who use the Internet, are using child pornographic and obscene material to desensitize children to sexual activity, to convince children that sexual activity involving children is normal, and to entice children to engage in sexual activity.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Gellatly,</i> 2009 WL 35166, at *7, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2693, at *24 (internal quotations and citations omitted). Simply put, Congress sought to protect \"[t]he primary victims of the crime of possession of child pornography,\" namely, \"the exploited children.\" <i>Id.; see also </i><i>Connection Distrib. Co. v. Holder,</i> 557 F.3d 321, 324 (6th Cir. 2009) (en banc) (stating that in enacting numerous pieces of legislation regarding child pornography, \"Congress [was] attempt[ing] to prevent the exploitation of children through pornography.\").</p>\n<p>Despite Congress' significant purpose in prohibiting the dissemination of child pornography, some courts and commentators have questioned the wisdom of the congressionally-directed Child Pornography Sentencing Guideline because they were the product of Congressional mandate rather than the Commission's preferred systematic, empirical approach. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Grober,</i> 624 F.3d at 608 (\"§ 2G2.2 was not developed pursuant to the Commission's institutional role and based on empirical data and national experience, but instead was developed largely pursuant to congressional directives.\"); <i>Dorvee,</i> 604 F.3d at 95, 97 (stating that the § 2G2.2 Guidelines are \"fundamentally different from most and that, unless applied with great care, can lead to unreasonable sentences,\" and describing § 2G2.2 as irrational); <i>Gellatly,</i> 2009 WL 35166, at *4, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2693, at *10 (stating that in areas such as child pornography, \"[w]hen Guidelines are not the result of the Commission's exercise of its characteristic institutional <span class=\"star-pagination\">*778</span> role, such as when they are not based on an empirical approach, but are instead keyed to or guided by statutory directives ... the Guideline ranges of imprisonment for those crimes are a less reliable appraisal of a fair sentence.\"); (R. 21-3, Troy Stabenow, <i>Deconstructing the Myth of Careful Study: A Primer on the Flawed Progression of the Child Pornography Guidelines</i> at 3 (explaining that \"the changes to the child pornography guidelines are not the product of an empirically demonstrated need for consistently tougher sentencing. Instead, these changes are largely the consequence of numerous morality earmarks, slipped into larger bills over the last fifteen years, often without notice, debate, or empirical study of any kind.\").) However, the debate regarding the wisdom of congressionally-mandated enhancements notwithstanding, it is unquestionably Congress' constitutional prerogative to issue sentencing directives such as the sentencing enhancements for quantity of images at issue in this case.</p>\n<p>It is axiomatic that \"[i]n our system, so far as at least concerns the federal powers, defining crimes and fixing penalties are legislative ... functions.\" <i>United States v. Evans,</i> 333 U.S. 483, 486, 68 S.Ct. 634, 92 L.Ed.2d 823 (1948). The Supreme Court has reiterated that \"Congress, of course, has the power to fix the sentence for a federal crime.\" <i>Mistretta v. United States,</i> 488 U.S. 361, 364, 109 S.Ct. 647, 102 L.Ed.2d 714 (1989); <i>see also United States v. Evanouskas,</i> 386 Fed. Appx. 882, 884 (11th Cir.2010).

Interpretation of § 2G2.2(b)(7)</h2>\n<p>The Guidelines provision at issue in the instant appeal is U.S.S.G. § 2G2.2(b)(7). It provides for an increase in a defendant's offense level for child pornography based on the number of images possessed. Defendant challenges the application of the Guidelines to duplicate digital images. In his brief to this Court, Defendant admits that duplicate hard copy images are counted separately for § 2G2.2(b)(7) purposes. However, Defendant nevertheless argues that only unique digital images, not duplicate digital images, should be counted in determining a sentencing enhancement under this Guideline provision.</p>\n<p>As discussed above, § 2G2.2(b)(7) was properly enacted pursuant to explicit congressional mandate, and congressional will should be considered in construing its parameters. In so doing, we note that congressional directives regarding sentencing for child pornography have consistently increased penalties. We further note that although Congress has explicitly expressed its desire to enhance punishments for child pornography offenses, Congress has not differentiated between digital images and hard copy images for the purposes of § 2G2.2(b)(7) image enumeration.</p>\n<p>Section 2G2.2(b)(7) provides for enhancements to a defendant's sentence as follows: \"If the offense involved(A) at least 10 images, but fewer than 150, increase by 2 levels; (B) at least 150 images, but fewer than 300, increase by 3 levels; (C) at least 300 images, but fewer than 600, increase by 4 levels; and (D) 600 or more images, increase by 5 levels.\"</p>\n<p>Like the congressional directive itself, the Application Note to § 2G2.2(b)(7) is similarly devoid of any indication that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*779</span> § 2G2.2(b)(7) differentiates between digital images and hard copy images.</p>\n<p>Application of Subsection (b)(7)</p>\n<blockquote>(A) Definition of \"images\"\"Images\" means any visual depiction, as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 2256(5), that constitutes child pornography, as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 2256(5).</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(B) Determining the number of images:For purposes of determining the number of images under subsection (b)(7):</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(i) Each photograph, picture, computer or computer-generated image, or any similar visual depiction shall be considered one image. If the number of images substantially underrepresents the number of minors involved, an upward departure may be warranted.</blockquote>\n<p>U.S.S.G. § 2G2.2 Application Note 4. In defining the term \"image,\" the Application Note refers only to \"any visual depiction.\" This suggests that duplicate visual depictions, digital or otherwise, should each be counted separately for purposes of this enhancement.</p>\n<p>Previous versions of the Child Pornography Sentencing Guidelines similarly treated digital images and hard copy images equivalently. The Commission's 2000 amendments to the Guidelines clarified that the enhancement then contained in § 2G2.4(b)(2) providing for \"a two-level enhancement if the offense involved possession of ten or more items of child pornography,\" stated that a \"computer file qualifies as an item for purposes of the enhancement,\" thus providing for identical treatment of digital images and hard copy images. (R. 21-3, Troy Stabenow, <i>Deconstructing the Myth of Careful Study: A Primer on the Flawed Progression of the Child Pornography Guidelines</i> at 18.)</p>\n<p>Defendant nevertheless attempts to distinguish duplicate hard copy images from duplicate digital images, stating: \"the rationale underlying the increase in levels based upon the number of images is obvious: each picture represents a separate victimization of those pictured.\" (Br. of Appellant at 9.) Defendant maintains, however, that duplicate digital images, such as those contained on Defendant's second hard drive, are not \"multiple victimizations.\" (<i>Id.</i>) Defendant argues that, as distinguished from duplicate digital images, \"there are practical reasons why [duplicate] hard copies could be treated [as multiple images]. Most obviously, because making [duplicate] hard copies requires more than a minimal amount of effort, and having [duplicate] hard copies makes it possible to potentially distribute them.\" (<i>Id.</i>)</p>\n<p>Defendant's argument implies that digital images and hard copy images are disseminated by dissimilar methods of distribution. In this vein, Defendant contends that it is significant that dissemination of hard copy images requires duplication. According to Defendant's reasoning, duplicate hard copy images should be counted separately pursuant to § 2G2.2(b)(7) inasmuch as the duplicates themselves are necessary for dissemination. However, this rationale does not similarly justify counting duplicate digital images separately.</p>\n<p>Digital distribution of child pornography is facilitated by file-sharing programs that allow users to access other users' computers to download shared digital images. Once an individual uploads a single digital image onto the file-sharing platform, an infinite number of users can access that digital image. Thus, possessing a duplicate digital image does not affect the quantity of child pornography available for digital distribution.</p>\n<p>However, although the rationale for individual counting of duplicate hard copy images does not extend to duplicate digital images, we remain mindful that the Child <span class=\"star-pagination\">*780</span> Pornography Guidelines contain no indication that either Congress or the Sentencing Commission intended to differentiate between hard copy images and digital images. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. § 2G2.2 Application Note 4.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>Moreover, it is significant that § 2G2.2(b)(7) applies to all of the following child pornography crimes: trafficking in material involving the sexual exploitation of a minor; receiving, transporting, shipping, soliciting, or advertising material involving the sexual exploitation of a minor; possessing material involving the sexual exploitation of a minor with intent to traffic; and possessing material involving the sexual exploitation of a minor. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. § 2G2.2(b)(7). The Guidelines provision applies equally to distribution and possession of child pornography. Its applicability is not dependent on a defendant's capacity to distribute child pornography. Thus, the rationale for differentiating between duplicate hard copy images and duplicate digital images based on differences in distribution methods is not persuasive.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, it is undisputed that § 2G2.2(b)(7) applies to possession of duplicate hard copy images, and that even in cases of simple possession of child pornography we consider the quantity of images involved in the crime relevant to the measure of a defendant's culpability. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Borho,</i> 485 F.3d 904, 910 (6th Cir.2007); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Acosta,</i> 619 F.3d 956, 962 (8th Cir.2010) (explaining that application of § 2G2.2(b)(7)(D) was proper in that case because \"enhancing a defendant's sentence for the number of illegal items with which he was involved is a common practice throughout the Guidelines\"). Therefore, neither application nor interpretation of § 2G2.2(b)(7) is tied to facilitation of distributing child pornography.</p>\n<p>We therefore find that duplicate digital images, like duplicate hard copy images, should be counted separately for purposes of calculating a sentence enhancement pursuant to § 2G2.2(b)(7).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. Summary</h2>\n<p>The district court did not err by counting duplicate images in calculating Defendant's U.S.S.G. § 2G2.2(b)(7) enhancement based on the number of images he possessed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court's decision.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*781</span> ROGERS, Circuit Judge, concurring.</p>\n<p>I concur in the result and in much of the reasoning of the majority opinion. Defendant makes the categorical argument in this case that identical duplicate images may not be counted separately for the purposes of calculating a sentencing enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 2G2.2(b)(7). For the reasons given in the majority opinion, we reject this argument.</p>\n<p>To reject an argument that duplicate digital images are never to be counted separately, however, does not require us to hold that they are always to be counted separately. It is not necessary for us to decide that broader issue in order to resolve this appeal. Indeed, the Government concedes that certain \"thumbnail\" duplicate images need not be separately counted. In the instant case, the duplicate images were in a back-up hard drive, thus decreasing the chance that the images would be lost. In that sense, the copies increase the likelihood of further distribution. In such a context, the district court could properly count the digital images separately. It is not necessary for us to rule more broadly that duplicate images must be counted even when their presence on the computer does not increase the likelihood of further distribution.</p>\n<p>As a related matter, I think it may be misleading to say that \"[p]ossessing duplicate digital images does not affect the supply of digital child pornography\" and that \"possessing duplicate digital images does not increase an individual's capacity to facilitate wide dissemination of that digital image.\" Maj. Op. 780 n.4. While the individual's ultimate capacity to disseminate may be the same, the likelihood of dissemination is obviously greater in some cases than others. The present instance is a good example: the existence of a back-up hard drive increases the risk that the images will be preserved and later viewed by the user or someone else. Similarly, having duplicates in different folders versus the same folder, or in undeleted versus deleted status, can change the likelihood of dissemination.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Although the district court and the litigants are not clear on this point, thumbnail images are not counted separately for U.S.S.G. § 2G2.2(b)(7) purposes because thumbnails are not duplicate digital images. Rather, thumbnails are simply previews of digital images that are viewable without opening the digital folder in which the digital images are contained.</p>\n<p>[2]  We use the term \"digital image\" to refer to any image saved on a digital medium, including, by way of example, a computer hard drive, a camera memory card, a flash drive, or the internet.\n</p>\n<p>We use the term \"duplicate digital image\" to refer to an identical copy of a digital image.</p>\n<p>We use the term \"unique digital image\" to refer to a digital image of which there are no duplicates.</p>\n<p>We use the term \"hard copy image\" to refer to any printed image, including, by way of example, a printed photograph, a picture in a magazine or book, or a videotape.</p>\n<p>We use the term \"duplicate hard copy image\" to refer to an identical copy of a hard copy image.</p>\n<p>We use the term \"unique hard copy image\" to refer to a hard copy image of which there are no duplicates.</p>\n<p>[3]  Three cases have raised the issue at the federal appellate level, only one of which analyzed whether duplicate digital images are counted for U.S.S.G. § 2G2.2(b)(7) purposes. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Sampson,</i> 606 F.3d 505 (8th Cir.2010); <i>United States v. Havens,</i> 331 Fed.Appx. 280, 282 (5th Cir.2009) (summarily dismissing the defendant's argument that \"there was evidence at trial that some of the images he possessed were duplicates.\"); <i>United States v. Goff,</i> 501 F.3d 250, 255 n. 9 (3d Cir.2007) (allowing the prosecution in that case to discount duplicate images for U.S.S.G. § 2G2.2(b)(7) purposes, although neither explicitly approving of this interpretation nor analyzing the Guidelines provision).</p>\n<p>[4]  The recent Eighth Circuit case <i>United States v. Sampson,</i> 606 F.3d 505 (8th Cir.2010), is the only case on the circuit level that we have identified which discusses whether duplicate digital images should be counted for purposes of a § 2G2.2(b)(7) sentence enhancement. In <i>Sampson</i> the Eighth Circuit held that § 2G2.2(b)(7) does not include a uniqueness requirement for counting digital images. The Eighth Circuit maintained that possessing duplicate digital images increases the supply of digital child pornography, and therefore, duplicate digital images should be counted separately for purposes of a § 2G2.2(b)(7) enhancement. <i>See id.</i> at 510.\n</p>\n<p>However, although we agree with the Eighth Circuit's holding in <i>Sampson</i> that duplicate digital images should be counted for purposes of a § 2G2.2(b)(7) sentence enhancement, we disagree with its reasoning to the extent that it is premised on a misunderstanding of the methods used to distribute digital images of child pornography. Possessing duplicate digital images does not affect the supply of digital child pornography. An individual possessing a unique digital image can disseminate that single image as widely as an individual possessing duplicate digital images. Once an individual uploads a digital image, an infinite number of people can download that single digital image. Therefore, possessing duplicate digital images does not increase an individual's capacity to facilitate wide dissemination of that digital image.</p>\n\n</div>",

Thompson, Federal Public Defender's Office, Cleveland, Ohio, for Appellant. Carol M. Skutnik, Assistant United States Attorney, Cleveland, Ohio, for Appellee.</p>\n<p>Before: SUHRHEINRICH, CLAY, and ROGERS, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>CLAY, J., delivered the opinion of the court, in which SUHRHEINRICH, J., joined. ROGERS, J. (p. 781), delivered a separate concurring opinion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>OPINION</h2>\n<p>CLAY, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>Defendant Timothy McNerney appeals his sentence of 120 months of incarceration, followed by 10 years of supervised release. The district court sentenced Defendant on August 12, 2009 following Defendant's guilty plea to one count of receiving and distributing visual depictions of real minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2252(a)(2), and one count of possession of child pornography in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2252A(a)(5)(B).</p>\n<p>For the reasons stated below, we AFFIRM the district court's decision.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>On February 20, 2007, federal agents obtained a valid search warrant to search Defendant Timothy McNerney's house based on a federal task force agent's determination, through an internet search, that Defendant was sharing 166 files depicting child pornography online via a peer-to-peer file-sharing program. Pursuant to this valid search warrant, federal agents searched Defendant's house, and seized Defendant's computer. A forensic analysis of Defendant's computer revealed that the file-sharing program was installed on Defendant's computer, and that numerous images of child pornography were located <span class=\"star-pagination\">*774</span> in the shared folder, allowing other users of the file-sharing program to access them. The agents also found that Defendant had backed up his files on a second hard drive, creating an identical second copy of all of the data contained on his computer, including the images of child pornography.</p>\n<p>A federal grand jury indicted Defendant on December 10, 2008, for receiving and distributing visual depictions of real minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2252(a)(2), and possession of child pornography in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2252A(a)(5)(B). On April 22, 2009, Defendant pled guilty to both counts of the indictment. On August 13, 2009, the district court held a sentencing hearing, and sentenced Defendant to an 120 month term of imprisonment, followed by 10 years of supervised release.</p>\n<p>At the sentencing hearing the district court calculated Defendant's total offense level at 30, and Defendant's criminal history category at I, producing an advisory sentence range of 97 to 121 months. In calculating Defendant's offense level, the district court began with a base offense level of 22, which both parties agreed was correct. The district court proceeded to add the following enhancements: a two level enhancement for images of prepubescent minors pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 2G2.2(ii); a two level enhancement for transferring materials over the internet pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 2G2.2(b)(3)(F); a two level enhancement for using a computer in the crime pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 2G2.2(b)(6); and a five level enhancement for having more than 600 images pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 2G2.2(b)(7), producing a total offense level of 33. The district court then adjusted Defendant's offense level for acceptance of responsibility, placing Defendant's final offense level at 30.</p>\n<p>Regarding its computation of the number of images Defendant possessed, based on which the district court enhanced Defendant's offense level by five points, and which is disputed in this appeal, the district court stated:</p>\n<blockquote>[T]here's a dispute about the number of images.<sup>[1]</sup> The Probation Department has recommended an additional five levels based on the finding that there are more than 600 images, specifically 766. The [D]efendant has argued that there's double counting because there are multiple copies of the same image and, therefore, those images should be counted only once in reaching the total.... Mr. McNerney had two hard drives and many of the images are found on both hard drives.... [G]iven that as the government pointed out the computer automatically creates a mirror image of the first hard drive on the second hard drive, and so if hard drive number one is damaged or erased all the images would still exist on the backup hard drive in pristine form, and in my view then we have multiple images and it's not double counting because we've got two separate hard drives and this means if one were damaged, the [D]efendant would still have them on the other hard drive. That's the only reason to have them on two hard drives, so I don't believe it's unfair or inappropriate to count, you know, we have image A on hard drive one and the same image is on hard drive two, we have two separate images and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*775</span> they could both be used and they are there in case one hard drive crashes. So I don't believe we have double counting, and given that, there are more than 600 images in total and so the plus five applies.</blockquote>\n<p>(R. 30, Tr. of Sentencing Proceeding at 4-5.)</p>\n<p>Defendant objected to the district court's computation, and the five level enhancement under U.S.S.G. § 2G2.2(b)(7). (<i>Id.</i> at 13-14.) Defendant timely appealed his sentence.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>DISCUSSION</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. Standard of Review</h2>\n<p>We review \"<i>de novo</i> a district court's interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines.\" <i>United States v. Gibson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"790399\"><a href=\"/opinion/790399/united-states-of-america-plaintiff-appelleecross-appellant-v-bobby/\"><span class=\"volume\">409</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">325</span></a></span>, 338 (6th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. Analysis</h2>\n<p>Defendant challenges the district court's application of a five level enhancement to his offense level for possessing 600 or more images, pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 2G2.2(b)(7). Section 2G2.2(b)(7) of the Sentencing Guidelines provides for an increase in a defendant's offense level for child pornography based on the number of images possessed as follows: \"If the offense involved(A) at least 10 images, but fewer than 150, increase by 2 levels; (B) at least 150 images, but fewer than 300, increase by 3 levels; (C) at least 300 images, but fewer than 600, increase by 4 levels; and (D) 600 or more images, increase by 5 levels.\"</p>\n<p>Defendant contends that only unique digital images, not duplicate digital images,<sup>[2]</sup> should be counted in computing an enhancement under this provision of the Sentencing Guidelines. This particular interpretive issue is a question of first impression for this Court. There is also a dearth of case law on this question in other circuits.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. History of § 2G2.2</h2>\n<p>As noted by several of our sister circuits, Congress has taken an active role in creating the sentencing scheme for child pornography offenses. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Grober,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"177929\"><a href=\"/opinion/177929/united-states-v-grober/\"><span class=\"volume\">624</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">592</span></a></span>, 608 (3d Cir.2010); <i>United States v.

The Child Pornography Sentencing Guidelines are \"fundamentally different from most.... Sentencing <span class=\"star-pagination\">*776</span> Guidelines are typically developed by the Sentencing Commission using an empirical approach based on data about past sentencing policies.\" <i>Dorvee,</i> 604 F.3d at 95 (citing <i>Rita v.

However, \"the Commission did not use this empirical approach in formulating the Guidelines for child pornography.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>The Child Pornography Sentencing Guidelines \"have been substantively amended nine times since 1987.\" <i>Grober,</i> 624 F.3d at 604. As Congress has placed a \"laser-like focus on the child pornography Guidelines, particularly in the last several years,\" <i>id.,</i> the Sentencing Commission's amendments to the Child Pornography Guidelines have often been at Congress' behest.</p>\n<p>In its report entitled, \"The History of the Child Pornography Guidelines,\" issued in October 2009, the United States Sentencing Commission explained that \"Congress has been particularly active over the last decade creating new offenses, increasing penalties, and issuing directives to the [Sentencing] Commission regarding child pornography offenses. Indeed, in 2008 [alone] the 110th Congress passed three new laws amending child pornography statutes.\" <i>History of the Child Pornography Guidelines,</i> Oct. 2009, at 1, available at http://www.ussc.gov/Research/ Research_Projects/Sex_Offenses/ 20091030_History_Child_Pornography_ Guidelines.pdf (last visited Feb. 8, 2011). Moreover, Congress' child pornography legislation initiatives have been unambiguously motivated by a desire to cast a wider criminal net, and impose harsher punishments for child pornography offenses. As the Second Circuit stated, \"at the direction of Congress, the Sentencing Commission has amended the Guidelines under § 2G2.2 several times since their introduction in 1987, each time recommending harsher penalties.\" <i>Dorvee,</i> 604 F.3d at 95; <i>see also </i><i>Grober,</i> 624 F.3d at 604-05 (stating that \"[i]t is clear ... that [in its several amendments to the Guidelines increasing penalties for child pornography] the Commission was constantly reacting to Congress's (sic.) repeated directives, and the penalties for child pornography offenses that were steadily, and often dramatically, increasing.\").</p>\n<p>In its recent report, the Sentencing Commission elaborated, \"Congress has demonstrated its continued interest in deterring and punishing child pornography offenses, prompting the [Sentencing] Commission to respond to multiple public laws that created new child pornography offenses, increased criminal penalties, directly (and uniquely) amended the child pornography guidelines, and required the [Sentencing] Commission to consider offender and offense characteristics for the child pornography guidelines.\" <i>History of the Child Pornography Guidelines, supra,</i> at 54. Specifically,</p>\n<blockquote>[f]or more than 30 years, and particularly in recent years, Congress has focused attention on the scope of child pornography offenses and the severity of penalties for child pornography offenders. Through creating new offenses, enacting new mandatory minimums, increasing statutory maximums, and providing directives to the [Sentencing] Commission, Congress has repeatedly expressed its will regarding appropriate penalties for child pornography offenders. Congress has specifically expressed an intent to raise penalties associated with certain child pornography offenses several times through directives to the Commission and statutory changes aimed at increasing the guideline penalties and reducing the incidence of downward departures for such offenses.</blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*777</span> <i>Id.</i> at 6. <i>See also </i><i>United States v.

Jan. 5, 2009) (summarizing the history of child pornography legislation).</p>\n<p>The Guidelines provision at issue in this case, § 2G2.2(b)(7), providing for a sentence enhancement of between two and five levels based on the number of images involved in the crime, was the direct product of one such Congressional initiative. Congress enacted the Prosecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to End the Exploitation of Children Today Act (\"PROTECT Act\"), which \"made several changes with respect to the child pornography guidelines and contained provisions by which Congress for the first and only time to date, directly amended the guidelines.\" <i>Id.</i> at 38. \"The PROTECT Act of 2003 instructed the Commission to amend § 2G2.2 to include the number-of-images enhancements, which are currently codified at § 2G2.2(b)(7) and range from two levels to five levels.\" <i>Dorvee,</i> 604 F.3d at 95 n. 6. Thus, \"[i]n 2003, pursuant to the Prosecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to end the Exploitation of Children Today Act (\"PROTECT Act\"), the Commission again revised the guidelines covering child pornography offenses,\" and added the quantity of images enhancement mandated by the PROTECT Act. <i>History of the Child Pornography Guidelines, supra,</i> at 38.</p>\n<p>Congress, in repeatedly enacting legislation regarding child pornography, \"demonstrated its continued interest in deterring and punishing child pornography offenses.\" <i>Id.</i> at 54. As one court explained,</p>\n<blockquote>[t]he clear focus of [the child pornography] legislation and concomitant Guidelines revision is on the patent evils of child pornography and the new dimension that computer technology adds to those evils. In particular, the amendments to the Guidelines reflect Congressional concerns that pedophiles, including those who use the Internet, are using child pornographic and obscene material to desensitize children to sexual activity, to convince children that sexual activity involving children is normal, and to entice children to engage in sexual activity.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Gellatly,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2009</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">35166</span></span>, at *7, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2009</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S. Dist.

Thus, \"[n]othwithstanding the delegation of authority provided to the Commission in the [Sentencing Reform Act], Congress retained ultimate authority over the federal sentencing guidelines.... Congress [thus] retains the ability to influence federal sentencing policy by enacting directives to the Commission,\" <i>History of the Child Pornography Guidelines, supra,</i> at 5-6, \"which the Commission is obliged to implement.\" <i>Grober,</i> 624 F.3d at 608.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Interpretation of § 2G2.2(b)(7)</h2>\n<p>The Guidelines provision at issue in the instant appeal is U.S.S.G. § 2G2.2(b)(7). It provides for an increase in a defendant's offense level for child pornography based on the number of images possessed. Defendant challenges the application of the Guidelines to duplicate digital images. In his brief to this Court, Defendant admits that duplicate hard copy images are counted separately for § 2G2.2(b)(7) purposes. However, Defendant nevertheless argues that only unique digital images, not duplicate digital images, should be counted in determining a sentencing enhancement under this Guideline provision.</p>\n<p>As discussed above, § 2G2.2(b)(7) was properly enacted pursuant to explicit congressional mandate, and congressional will should be considered in construing its parameters. In so doing, we note that congressional directives regarding sentencing for child pornography have consistently increased penalties. We further note that although Congress has explicitly expressed its desire to enhance punishments for child pornography offenses, Congress has not differentiated between digital images and hard copy images for the purposes of § 2G2.2(b)(7) image enumeration.</p>\n<p>Section 2G2.2(b)(7) provides for enhancements to a defendant's sentence as follows: \"If the offense involved(A) at least 10 images, but fewer than 150, increase by 2 levels; (B) at least 150 images, but fewer than 300, increase by 3 levels; (C) at least 300 images, but fewer than 600, increase by 4 levels; and (D) 600 or more images, increase by 5 levels.\"</p>\n<p>Like the congressional directive itself, the Application Note to § 2G2.2(b)(7) is similarly devoid of any indication that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*779</span> § 2G2.2(b)(7) differentiates between digital images and hard copy images.</p>\n<p>Application of Subsection (b)(7)</p>\n<blockquote>(A) Definition of \"images\"\"Images\" means any visual depiction, as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 2256(5), that constitutes child pornography, as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 2256(5).</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(B) Determining the number of images:For purposes of determining the number of images under subsection (b)(7):</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(i) Each photograph, picture, computer or computer-generated image, or any similar visual depiction shall be considered one image. If the number of images substantially underrepresents the number of minors involved, an upward departure may be warranted.</blockquote>\n<p>U.S.S.G. § 2G2.2 Application Note 4. In defining the term \"image,\" the Application Note refers only to \"any visual depiction.\" This suggests that duplicate visual depictions, digital or otherwise, should each be counted separately for purposes of this enhancement.</p>\n<p>Previous versions of the Child Pornography Sentencing Guidelines similarly treated digital images and hard copy images equivalently. The Commission's 2000 amendments to the Guidelines clarified that the enhancement then contained in § 2G2.4(b)(2) providing for \"a two-level enhancement if the offense involved possession of ten or more items of child pornography,\" stated that a \"computer file qualifies as an item for purposes of the enhancement,\" thus providing for identical treatment of digital images and hard copy images. (R. 21-3, Troy Stabenow, <i>Deconstructing the Myth of Careful Study: A Primer on the Flawed Progression of the Child Pornography Guidelines</i> at 18.)</p>\n<p>Defendant nevertheless attempts to distinguish duplicate hard copy images from duplicate digital images, stating: \"the rationale underlying the increase in levels based upon the number of images is obvious: each picture represents a separate victimization of those pictured.\" (Br. of Appellant at 9.) Defendant maintains, however, that duplicate digital images, such as those contained on Defendant's second hard drive, are not \"multiple victimizations.\" (<i>Id.</i>) Defendant argues that, as distinguished from duplicate digital images, \"there are practical reasons why [duplicate] hard copies could be treated [as multiple images]. Most obviously, because making [duplicate] hard copies requires more than a minimal amount of effort, and having [duplicate] hard copies makes it possible to potentially distribute them.\" (<i>Id.</i>)</p>\n<p>Defendant's argument implies that digital images and hard copy images are disseminated by dissimilar methods of distribution. In this vein, Defendant contends that it is significant that dissemination of hard copy images requires duplication. According to Defendant's reasoning, duplicate hard copy images should be counted separately pursuant to § 2G2.2(b)(7) inasmuch as the duplicates themselves are necessary for dissemination. However, this rationale does not similarly justify counting duplicate digital images separately.</p>\n<p>Digital distribution of child pornography is facilitated by file-sharing programs that allow users to access other users' computers to download shared digital images. Once an individual uploads a single digital image onto the file-sharing platform, an infinite number of users can access that digital image. Thus, possessing a duplicate digital image does not affect the quantity of child pornography available for digital distribution.</p>\n<p>However, although the rationale for individual counting of duplicate hard copy images does not extend to duplicate digital images, we remain mindful that the Child <span class=\"star-pagination\">*780</span> Pornography Guidelines contain no indication that either Congress or the Sentencing Commission intended to differentiate between hard copy images and digital images. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. § 2G2.2 Application Note 4.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>Moreover, it is significant that § 2G2.2(b)(7) applies to all of the following child pornography crimes: trafficking in material involving the sexual exploitation of a minor; receiving, transporting, shipping, soliciting, or advertising material involving the sexual exploitation of a minor; possessing material involving the sexual exploitation of a minor with intent to traffic; and possessing material involving the sexual exploitation of a minor. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. § 2G2.2(b)(7). The Guidelines provision applies equally to distribution and possession of child pornography. Its applicability is not dependent on a defendant's capacity to distribute child pornography. Thus, the rationale for differentiating between duplicate hard copy images and duplicate digital images based on differences in distribution methods is not persuasive.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, it is undisputed that § 2G2.2(b)(7) applies to possession of duplicate hard copy images, and that even in cases of simple possession of child pornography we consider the quantity of images involved in the crime relevant to the measure of a defendant's culpability. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Borho,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"797682\"><a href=\"/opinion/797682/united-states-v-norman-borho/\"><span class=\"volume\">485</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">904</span></a></span>, 910 (6th Cir.2007); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Acosta,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"174434\"><a href=\"/opinion/174434/united-states-v-acosta/\"><span class=\"volume\">619</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">956</span></a></span>, 962 (8th Cir.2010) (explaining that application of § 2G2.2(b)(7)(D) was proper in that case because \"enhancing a defendant's sentence for the number of illegal items with which he was involved is a common practice throughout the Guidelines\"). Therefore, neither application nor interpretation of § 2G2.2(b)(7) is tied to facilitation of distributing child pornography.</p>\n<p>We therefore find that duplicate digital images, like duplicate hard copy images, should be counted separately for purposes of calculating a sentence enhancement pursuant to § 2G2.2(b)(7).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. Summary</h2>\n<p>The district court did not err by counting duplicate images in calculating Defendant's U.S.S.G. § 2G2.2(b)(7) enhancement based on the number of images he possessed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court's decision.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*781</span> ROGERS, Circuit Judge, concurring.</p>\n<p>I concur in the result and in much of the reasoning of the majority opinion. Defendant makes the categorical argument in this case that identical duplicate images may not be counted separately for the purposes of calculating a sentencing enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 2G2.2(b)(7). For the reasons given in the majority opinion, we reject this argument.</p>\n<p>To reject an argument that duplicate digital images are never to be counted separately, however, does not require us to hold that they are always to be counted separately. It is not necessary for us to decide that broader issue in order to resolve this appeal. Indeed, the Government concedes that certain \"thumbnail\" duplicate images need not be separately counted. In the instant case, the duplicate images were in a back-up hard drive, thus decreasing the chance that the images would be lost. In that sense, the copies increase the likelihood of further distribution. In such a context, the district court could properly count the digital images separately. It is not necessary for us to rule more broadly that duplicate images must be counted even when their presence on the computer does not increase the likelihood of further distribution.</p>\n<p>As a related matter, I think it may be misleading to say that \"[p]ossessing duplicate digital images does not affect the supply of digital child pornography\" and that \"possessing duplicate digital images does not increase an individual's capacity to facilitate wide dissemination of that digital image.\" Maj. Op. 780 n.4. While the individual's ultimate capacity to disseminate may be the same, the likelihood of dissemination is obviously greater in some cases than others. The present instance is a good example: the existence of a back-up hard drive increases the risk that the images will be preserved and later viewed by the user or someone else. Similarly, having duplicates in different folders versus the same folder, or in undeleted versus deleted status, can change the likelihood of dissemination.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Although the district court and the litigants are not clear on this point, thumbnail images are not counted separately for U.S.S.G. § 2G2.2(b)(7) purposes because thumbnails are not duplicate digital images. Rather, thumbnails are simply previews of digital images that are viewable without opening the digital folder in which the digital images are contained.</p>\n<p>[2]  We use the term \"digital image\" to refer to any image saved on a digital medium, including, by way of example, a computer hard drive, a camera memory card, a flash drive, or the internet.\n</p>\n<p>We use the term \"duplicate digital image\" to refer to an identical copy of a digital image.</p>\n<p>We use the term \"unique digital image\" to refer to a digital image of which there are no duplicates.</p>\n<p>We use the term \"hard copy image\" to refer to any printed image, including, by way of example, a printed photograph, a picture in a magazine or book, or a videotape.</p>\n<p>We use the term \"duplicate hard copy image\" to refer to an identical copy of a hard copy image.</p>\n<p>We use the term \"unique hard copy image\" to refer to a hard copy image of which there are no duplicates.</p>\n<p>[3]  Three cases have raised the issue at the federal appellate level, only one of which analyzed whether duplicate digital images are counted for U.S.S.G. § 2G2.2(b)(7) purposes. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Sampson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"147195\"><a href=\"/opinion/147195/united-states-v-sampson/\"><span class=\"volume\">606</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">505</span></a></span> (8th Cir.2010); <i>United States v. Havens,</i> 331 Fed.Appx. 280, 282 (5th Cir.2009) (summarily dismissing the defendant's argument that \"there was evidence at trial that some of the images he possessed were duplicates.\"); <i>United States v. Goff,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1460543\"><a href=\"/opinion/1460543/united-states-v-goff/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">250</span></a></span>, 255 n. 9 (3d Cir.2007) (allowing the prosecution in that case to discount duplicate images for U.S.S.G. § 2G2.2(b)(7) purposes, although neither explicitly approving of this interpretation nor analyzing the Guidelines provision).</p>\n<p>[4]  The recent Eighth Circuit case <i>United States v. Sampson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"147195\"><a href=\"/opinion/147195/united-states-v-sampson/\"><span class=\"volume\">606</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">505</span></a></span> (8th Cir.2010), is the only case on the circuit level that we have identified which discusses whether duplicate digital images should be counted for purposes of a § 2G2.2(b)(7) sentence enhancement. In <i>Sampson</i> the Eighth Circuit held that § 2G2.2(b)(7) does not include a uniqueness requirement for counting digital images. The Eighth Circuit maintained that possessing duplicate digital images increases the supply of digital child pornography, and therefore, duplicate digital images should be counted separately for purposes of a § 2G2.2(b)(7) enhancement. <i>See id.</i> at 510.\n</p>\n<p>However, although we agree with the Eighth Circuit's holding in <i>Sampson</i> that duplicate digital images should be counted for purposes of a § 2G2.2(b)(7) sentence enhancement, we disagree with its reasoning to the extent that it is premised on a misunderstanding of the methods used to distribute digital images of child pornography. Possessing duplicate digital images does not affect the supply of digital child pornography. An individual possessing a unique digital image can disseminate that single image as widely as an individual possessing duplicate digital images. Once an individual uploads a digital image, an infinite number of people can download that single digital image. Therefore, possessing duplicate digital images does not increase an individual's capacity to facilitate wide dissemination of that digital image.</p>\n\n</div>",
