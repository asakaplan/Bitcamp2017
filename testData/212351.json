MARTIN, JR., Circuit Judge. Defendant-appellant Develae Paige\nappeals the district court’s judgment sentencing him as an Armed Career Criminal. We\nAFFIRM.\n\n                                 I. BACKGROUND\n\n       On May 13, 2009, a jury convicted Paige of being a felon in possession of a\nfirearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g) (2006). The Presentence Report indicated that\nPaige should be sentenced as an Armed Career Criminal pursuant to U.S.S.G.\n§ 4B1.4(b)(3)(B) and 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(1). The Armed Career Criminal Act imposes\na mandatory fifteen-year prison term on defendants who have been convicted for a\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g) if they have three previous convictions “for a violent\nfelony or a serious drug offense, or both, committed on occasions different from one\nanother.” 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(1). The Presentence Report classified Paige as an Armed\nCareer Criminal because he had previously been convicted of one aggravated assault and\nfive aggravated robberies. Although the five robberies occurred on the same day, were\nclose in location, and Paige pled guilty to them at the same time, they involved distinct\ntimes, locations, and victims. Paige objected to being sentenced as an Armed Career\nCriminal. He argued that the robberies should be considered as one continuous crime\nspree and thus count only as one conviction for purposes of determining his status as an\nArmed Career Criminal. The district court conducted a sentencing hearing on September\n2, held that Paige was an Armed Career Criminal, and sentenced him to a term of sixteen\nyears and eight months imprisonment. Paige appeals.\n\fNo. 09-6067         United States v. Paige                                            Page 3\n\n\n                                     II. ANALYSIS\n\n        We review de novo the district court’s decision that Paige’s five robberies were\ncommitted on different occasions under the Act. United States v. Hill, 440 F.3d 292, 295\n(6th Cir. 2006).\n\n        In Hill, we held that two offenses are committed on different occasions under the\nAct if: (1) “it is possible to discern the point at which the first offense is completed, and\nthe subsequent point at which the second offense begins”; (2) “it would have been\npossible for the offender to cease his criminal conduct after the first offense, and\nwithdraw without committing the second offense”; or (3) “the offenses are committed\nin different residences or business locations.” Id. at 297-98. Since Hill, we have\ncontinued to follow this analysis to determine whether prior offenses qualify for Armed\nCareer Criminal status, and it is consistent with the approach taken by the other circuits.\nPaige concedes that his five robbery convictions would count separately under all three\nof the Hill tests, and that his appeal fails if Hill remains good law. (Brief of the\nDefendant/Appellant at 10.) Absent an intervening Supreme Court or en banc decision,\nwe lack the authority to overrule Hill. See, e.g., Ahearn v. Jackson Hosp. Corp., 351\nF.3d 226, 235 (6th Cir. 2003).\n\n        Paige claims that in Begay v. United States, 553 U.S. 137 (2008), the Supreme\nCourt implicitly overruled Hill insomuch as the Hill test may find some non-recidivist\nindividuals to be Armed Career Criminals. Thus, the issue before us is whether Begay\nin fact implicitly overruled Hill. We hold that it did not.\n\n        Begay addressed the narrow question of “whether driving under the influence of\nalcohol is a ‘violent felony’ as the Act defines it,” and concluded that it is not. Id. at\n139. Begay did not address the issue presented in Hill and this case: whether crimes are\nconsidered to have been committed on different occasions under the Act. Begay\ndiscusses Congress’s purposes and intent in enacting the Act, and Paige points to several\nstatements in the opinion that he claims suggest that it overruled Hill. See, e.g., id. at\n146 (“We have no reason to believe that Congress intended a 15-year mandatory prison\nterm where that increased likelihood [of recidivism] does not exist.”); id. at 147 (stating\n\fNo. 09-6067         United States v. Paige                                           Page 4\n\n\nthat the purpose of the Act is to “punish only a particular subset of offender, namely,\ncareer criminals”). However, these statements are insufficient to implicitly overrule Hill\nwhen they do not address the portion of the statute at issue in Hill and do not suggest that\nthe Hill tests fail to accurately capture Congress’s views regarding recidivism. Thus, we\nfind that the district court’s decision is consistent with current Sixth Circuit precedent.\n\n                                  III. CONCLUSION\n\n        Begay did not implicitly overrule Hill. The district court’s determination that\nPaige is an Armed Career Criminal is consistent with Hill. Thus, we AFFIRM the\ndecision of the district court.\n\f",
