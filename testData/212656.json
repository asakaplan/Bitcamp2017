It is a well-established rule of this circuit that one\npanel cannot overrule the holding of another panel, absent an intervening inconsistent\nopinion from the U.S. Supreme Court. Susan Lewis, however, asks this panel to do just\nthat. She complains that the jury considering her discrimination claim under the\nAmericans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) should have been instructed that, in order for\n\n\n                                          1\n\fNo. 09-6381             Lewis v. Humboldt Acquisition Corp.                                  Page 2\n\n\nher to prevail, her disability need only be the “motivating factor” for her termination, as\nrequired by a supermajority of our sister circuits, rather than the “sole” factor, as\nrequired by Monette v. Electronic Data Systems Corp., 90 F.3d 1173, 1178 (6th Cir.\n1996). Regardless of whether or not this holding of Monette is correct on the merits, this\npanel is powerless to overrule it. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district\ncourt.\n\n                                         I. Background\n\n             Susan Lewis, a registered nurse, began working in July 2004 at Humboldt Manor\nNursing Home (“Humboldt Manor”). At some time in September 2005, she alleged that\nshe developed a medical condition that, “among other things, affected her lower\nextremities.” This condition, she alleged, made it difficult for her to walk and entirely\nprevented her from working for one month. When Lewis returned to work, she\nsometimes used a wheelchair.\n\n             Humboldt Manor terminated Lewis on March 20, 2006. Its alleged reason for\nher termination was an “outburst” by Lewis at the nurses’ station that occurred on March\n15. Three employees of Humboldt Manor testified that during this outburst, Lewis\nyelled, criticized her supervisors, and used profanity. Lewis and another employee, Tom\nCollins, testified that Lewis was upset but did nothing inappropriate. Lewis believed\nthat the true cause of her termination was her use of a wheelchair—i.e., her\ndisability—and that Humboldt Manor had exaggerated the severity of her behavior in\norder to use it as a pretext for her termination.\n\n             Lewis filed suit in federal district court for wrongful termination under the\n         1\nADA. In her proposed jury instructions, Lewis requested that the jury must determine\nwhether her perceived disability was a “motivating factor” in the termination decision.\nThe district court, instead, mirroring its jury instructions on Monette v. Electronic Data\nSystems Corp., 90 F.3d 1173, 1178 (6th Cir. 1996), told the jury that Lewis could\n\n\n             1\n           Lewis’s lawsuit also included a claim under the ADA’s state-law counterpart, the Tennessee\nDisability Act, but that claim is not at issue in this appeal.\n\fNo. 09-6381            Lewis v. Humboldt Acquisition Corp.                                          Page 3\n\n\nrecover only if her disability was the “sole reason” for the decision to terminate. The\njury found in favor of Lewis on two of the three elements of her ADA claim: it\ndetermined that Humboldt Manor regarded her as disabled and that she was a “qualified\nindividual” under the ADA. However, the jury found against Lewis on the third\nelement: it determined that her disability was not the sole reason for her termination.\nAccordingly, the district court entered judgment in favor of Humboldt Manor. Lewis\nnow appeals on a single issue: whether the district court erred by instructing the jury on\nthe “solely” causation standard.\n\n                                              II. Analysis\n\n         The ADA prohibits discrimination “on the basis of” disability. 42 U.S.C.\n§ 12112(a). Of the ten circuits that have considered the contours of this causation\nstandard, eight currently apply a “motivating factor” (or a “substantial cause”) test; that\nis, a plaintiff must prove that his disability was only a motivating factor of the adverse\nemployment action in order to prevail. See, e.g., Pinkerton v. Spellings, 529 F.3d 513,\n518–19 & n.30 (5th Cir. 2008) (collecting cases). The current law in the Sixth Circuit,2\nhowever, is that a plaintiff must prove that his disability was the “sole reason” for the\nadverse employment action. See Monette v. Elec. Data Sys. Corp., 90 F.3d 1173, 1178\n(6th Cir. 1996) (“To recover on a claim of discrimination under the [ADA], a plaintiff\nmust show that . . . he was discharged solely by reason of his handicap.”) (emphasis\nadded).3 Lewis challenges the district court’s use of the “solely” standard in its\ninstructions to the jury. In essence, she asks this panel to overrule Monette and join\nsides with the supermajority of the circuits.\n\n\n\n\n         2\n           The Tenth Circuit appears to be the only other circuit that currently employs the “solely”\nstandard for ADA discrimination claims. See, e.g., Fitzgerald v. Corr. Corp. of Am., 403 F.3d 1134, 1144\n(10th Cir. 2005); Williams v. Widnall, 79 F.3d 1003, 1005 (10th Cir. 1996).\n         3\n           The Sixth Circuit apparently adopted the “solely” causation standard for ADA claims from the\nRehabilitation Act of 1973, which itself expressly requires sole causation, see 29 U.S.C. § 794(a), due to\nthe parallel nature of those two statutes. See Monette, 90 F.3d at 1177 (mentioning briefly, as justification\nfor the “solely” standard, that “[t]he analysis of claims under the [ADA] roughly parallels those brought\nunder the Rehabilitation Act”).\n\fNo. 09-6381            Lewis v. Humboldt Acquisition Corp.                                        Page 4\n\n\n         “A panel of this Court cannot overrule the decision of another panel. The prior\ndecision remains controlling authority unless an inconsistent decision of the United\nStates Supreme Court requires modification of the decision or this Court sitting en banc\noverrules the prior decision.” Salmi v. Sec’y of Health & Human Servs., 774 F.2d 685,\n689 (6th Cir. 1985). This principle also has been codified in the Sixth Circuit Rules. See\n6th Cir. R. 206(c) (“Reported panel opinions are binding on subsequent panels. Thus,\nno subsequent panel overrules a published opinion of a previous panel. Court en banc\nconsideration is required to overrule a published opinion of the court.”).\n\n         The parties do not cite any U.S. Supreme Court decision that is inconsistent with\nthis circuit’s use of the “solely” standard, nor has our own independent research\nuncovered any. Moreover, on four separate occasions already, panels of judges on this\ncircuit have refused to overrule Monette’s “solely” standard; each time, those panels\ncited Salmi to explain that their hands were tied. See Macy v. Hopkins County Sch. Bd.\nof Educ., 484 F.3d 357, 364 n.2 (6th Cir. 2007) (explaining that the panel was “bound\nby Monette” whether its reasoning “was correct or not”); Hedrick v. W. Reserve Case\nSys., 355 F.3d 444, 454 (6th Cir. 2004); see also Layman v. Alloway Stamping & Mach.\nCo., 98 F. App’x 369, 375–76 (6th Cir. 2004) (unpublished); McLeod v. Parsons Corp.,\n73 F. App’x 846, 858 (6th Cir. 2003) (unpublished). Lewis provides no reason in her\nbrief why this panel can overrule Monette when so many others held that they could not.\n\n         Accordingly, Sixth Circuit rules prevent this panel from overruling Monette’s\nholding that for a plaintiff to prevail on a discrimination claim under the ADA she must\nprove that she was terminated “solely” because of her disability. Unless that holding is\noverruled by the full Sixth Circuit sitting en banc or is undermined by an inconsistent\ndecision from the U.S. Supreme Court, it remains good law in this circuit. Lewis’s jury\ninstructions, which were based on Monette, were proper.4\n\n\n         4\n           To avoid the inefficiency of appealing to a panel that could not grant her the remedy that she\nseeks, Lewis could have filed a petition requesting that her appeal initially be heard en banc, rather than\nby this panel. See Fed. R. App. P. 35. Although en banc hearings are “not favored,” they may be ordered\nwhen “the proceeding involves a question of exceptional importance.” Fed. R. App. P. 35(a)(2). One such\nexample is a case in which a panel decision “conflicts with the authoritative decisions of other United\nStates Courts of Appeals that have addressed the issue.” Fed. R. App. P. 35(b)(1)(B). Of course, after this\npanel issues its opinion, Lewis may still move for rehearing en banc. See Fed. R. App. P. 40.\n\fNo. 09-6381       Lewis v. Humboldt Acquisition Corp.                 Page 5\n\n\n                                 III. Conclusion\n\n      For these reasons, we AFFIRM the district court’s judgment in favor of\nHumboldt Manor.\n\fNo. 09-6381        Lewis v. Humboldt Acquisition Corp.                              Page 6\n\n\n                               _____________________\n\n                                  CONCURRENCE\n                               _____________________\n\n       GRIFFIN, Circuit Judge, concurring. I join in the majority opinion because our\nprecedent currently requires a plaintiff bringing a discrimination claim under the ADA\nto show that her disability was the “sole reason” for the adverse employment action. See\nJones v. Potter, 488 F.3d 397, 403 (6th Cir. 2007); Hedrick v. W. Reserve Care Sys., 355\nF.3d 444, 452 (6th Cir. 2004); Monette v. Elec. Data Sys. Corp., 90 F.3d 1173, 1178 (6th\nCir. 1996). Because that precedent is binding on this panel, the majority correctly\nconcludes that we are compelled to affirm the judgment of the district court. Salmi v.\nSec’y of Health & Human Servs., 774 F.2d 685, 689 (6th Cir. 1985); see also 6th Cir. R.\n206(c) (explaining that “[r]eported panel opinions are binding on subsequent panels”).\nI write separately because our precedent on this issue of exceptional importance is\nmisguided and contrary to the overwhelming authority of our sister circuits.\nAccordingly, the question appears appropriate for rehearing en banc. See Fed. R. App.\nP. 35(b)(1)(B).\n\n       We lifted the “sole reason” requirement from the Rehabilitation Act’s “solely by\nreason of her or his disability” language, see 29 U.S.C. § 794(a), and imported it into the\nADA, reasoning in a footnote in Maddox v. University of Tennessee, 62 F.3d 843 (6th\nCir. 1995), that “[t]he analysis of claims under the Americans with Disabilities Act\nroughly parallels those brought under the Rehabilitation Act.” Monette, 90 F.3d at 1177-\n78 (citing Maddox, 62 F.3d at 846 n.2). As a super-majority of our sister circuits have\nheld, however, the plain language of the ADA does not support application of the\nRehabilitation Act’s “sole reason” standard. See Pinkerton v. Spellings, 529 F.3d 513,\n518-19 & n.30 (5th Cir. 2008) (collecting cases); see also Macy v. Hopkins County Sch.\nBd. of Educ., 484 F.3d 357, 364 n.2 (6th Cir. 2007) (“It appears that every other circuit\nsave one that has addressed the issue has held that an employee may recover under the\nADA if the employee’s disability was a ‘motivating factor’ in the employer’s decision,\n\fNo. 09-6381         Lewis v. Humboldt Acquisition Corp.                               Page 7\n\n\nand that the employee need not establish that he or she was fired ‘solely’ because of his\nor her disability.”).\n\n        In construing a statute, “[i]t is elementary that the meaning . . . must, in the first\ninstance, be sought in the language in which the act is framed, and if that is plain, and\nif the law is within the constitutional authority of the lawmaking body which passed it,\nthe sole function of the courts is to enforce it according to its terms.” Caminetti v.\nUnited States, 242 U.S. 470, 485 (1917); accord United States v. Washington, 584 F.3d\n693, 695 (6th Cir. 2009). “If the words are plain, they give meaning to the act, and it is\nneither the duty nor the privilege of the courts to enter speculative fields in search of a\ndifferent meaning.” Caminetti, 242 U.S. at 490. Indeed, the Supreme Court has\nadmonished “time and again that courts must presume that a legislature says in a statute\nwhat it means and means in a statute what it says there.” Arlington Cent. Sch. Dist. Bd.\nof Educ. v. Murphy, 548 U.S. 291, 296 (2006) (citation and internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n\n        Here, the ADA prohibits discrimination “on the basis of disability,” 42 U.S.C.\n§ 12112(a), (formerly “because of”) and “by reason of such disability,” id. at § 12132.\nOur sister circuits have observed that, among other things, these provisions “do not\ncontain the word ‘solely,’ or any other similar restrictive term,” McNely v. Ocala\nStar-Banner Corp., 99 F.3d 1068, 1073 (11th Cir. 1996), and that “[t]he elimination of\nthe word ‘solely’ from the causation provision of the ADA suggests forcefully that\nCongress intended the statute to reach beyond the Rehabilitation Act to cover situations\nin which discrimination on the basis of disability is one factor, but not the only factor,\nmotivating an adverse employment action,” Parker v. Columbia Pictures Indus., 204\nF.3d 326, 337 (2d Cir. 2000). I agree with these courts and were I allowed, I would hold\nthat our “sole reason” standard is contrary to the plain language of the ADA.\n\f",

Susan Lewis, however, asks this panel to do just that. She complains that the jury considering her discrimination claim under the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\") should have been instructed that, in order for her to prevail, her disability need only be the \"motivating factor\" for her termination, as required by a supermajority of our sister circuits, rather than the \"sole\" factor, as required by <i>Monette v. Electronic Data Systems Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"722567\"><a href=\"/opinion/722567/roger-monette-and-doris-monette-v-electronic-data-systems-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">90</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1173</span></a></span>, 1178 (6th Cir.1996). Regardless of whether or not this holding of <i>Monette</i> is correct on the merits, this panel is powerless to overrule it. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*880</span> I. Background</h2>\n<p>Susan Lewis, a registered nurse, began working in July 2004 at Humboldt Manor Nursing Home (\"Humboldt Manor\"). At some time in September 2005, she alleged that she developed a medical condition that, \"among other things, affected her lower extremities.\" This condition, she alleged, made it difficult for her to walk and entirely prevented her from working for one month. When Lewis returned to work, she sometimes used a wheelchair.</p>\n<p>Humboldt Manor terminated Lewis on March 20, 2006. Its alleged reason for her termination was an \"outburst\" by Lewis at the nurses' station that occurred on March 15. Three employees of Humboldt Manor testified that during this outburst, Lewis yelled, criticized her supervisors, and used profanity. Lewis and another employee, Tom Collins, testified that Lewis was upset but did nothing inappropriate. Lewis believed that the true cause of her termination was her use of a wheelchair<i>i.e.,</i> her disabilityand that Humboldt Manor had exaggerated the severity of her behavior in order to use it as a pretext for her termination.</p>\n<p>Lewis filed suit in federal district court for wrongful termination under the ADA.<sup>[1]</sup> In her proposed jury instructions, Lewis requested that the jury must determine whether her perceived disability was a \"motivating factor\" in the termination decision. The district court, instead, mirroring its jury instructions on <i>Monette v. Electronic Data Systems Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"722567\"><a href=\"/opinion/722567/roger-monette-and-doris-monette-v-electronic-data-systems-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">90</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1173</span></a></span>, 1178 (6th Cir.1996), told the jury that Lewis could recover only if her disability was the \"sole reason\" for the decision to terminate. The jury found in favor of Lewis on two of the three elements of her ADA claim: it determined that Humboldt Manor regarded her as disabled and that she was a \"qualified individual\" under the ADA. However, the jury found against Lewis on the third element: it determined that her disability was not the sole reason for her termination. Accordingly, the district court entered judgment in favor of Humboldt Manor. Lewis now appeals on a single issue: whether the district court erred by instructing the jury on the \"solely\" causation standard.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. Analysis</h2>\n<p>The ADA prohibits discrimination \"on the basis of\" disability. 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). Of the ten circuits that have considered the contours of this causation standard, eight currently apply a \"motivating factor\" (or a \"substantial cause\") test; that is, a plaintiff must prove that his disability was only a motivating factor of the adverse employment action in order to prevail. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Pinkerton v. Spellings,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"61643\"><a href=\"/opinion/61643/pinkerton-v-spellings/\"><span class=\"volume\">529</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">513</span></a></span>, 518-19 &amp; n. 30 (5th Cir.2008) (collecting cases). The current law in the Sixth Circuit,<sup>[2]</sup> however, is that a plaintiff must prove that his disability was the \"sole reason\" for the adverse employment action. <i>See </i><i>Monette v. Elec. Data Sys. Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"722567\"><a href=\"/opinion/722567/roger-monette-and-doris-monette-v-electronic-data-systems-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">90</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1173</span></a></span>, 1178 (6th Cir.1996) (\"To recover on a claim of discrimination under the [ADA], a plaintiff must show that . . . he was discharged <i>solely</i> by reason of his handicap.\") (emphasis added).<sup>[3]</sup><span class=\"star-pagination\">*881</span> Lewis challenges the district court's use of the \"solely\" standard in its instructions to the jury. In essence, she asks this panel to overrule <i>Monette</i> and join sides with the supermajority of the circuits.</p>\n<p>\"A panel of this Court cannot overrule the decision of another panel. The prior decision remains controlling authority unless an inconsistent decision of the United States Supreme Court requires modification of the decision or this Court sitting en banc overrules the prior decision.\" <i>Salmi v. Sec'y of Health &amp; Human Servs.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"459011\"><a href=\"/opinion/459011/jan-m-sexton-salmi-v-secretary-of-health-and-human-services/\"><span class=\"volume\">774</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">685</span></a></span>, 689 (6th Cir.1985). This principle also has been codified in the Sixth Circuit Rules. <i>See</i> 6th Cir. R. 206(c) (\"Reported panel opinions are binding on subsequent panels. Thus, no subsequent panel overrules a published opinion of a previous panel. Court en banc consideration is required to overrule a published opinion of the court.\").</p>\n<p>The parties do not cite any U.S. Supreme Court decision that is inconsistent with this circuit's use of the \"solely\" standard, nor has our own independent research uncovered any. Moreover, on four separate occasions already, panels of judges on this circuit have refused to overrule <i>Monette</i>'s \"solely\" standard; each time, those panels cited <i>Salmi</i> to explain that their hands were tied. <i>See </i><i>Macy v. Hopkins County Sch. Bd. of Educ.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"797536\"><a href=\"/opinion/797536/sharon-macy-v-hopkins-county-school-board-of-education/\"><span class=\"volume\">484</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">357</span></a></span>, 364 n. 2 (6th Cir.2007) (explaining that the panel was \"bound by <i>Monette</i>\" whether its reasoning \"was correct or not\"); <i>Hedrick v. W. Reserve Care Sys.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"784781\"><a href=\"/opinion/784781/joanne-hedrick-v-western-reserve-care-system-and-forum-health/\"><span class=\"volume\">355</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">444</span></a></span>, 454 (6th Cir.2004); <i>see also </i><i>Layman v.

R.App. P. 35. Although en banc hearings are \"not favored,\" they may be ordered when \"the proceeding involves a question of exceptional importance.\" Fed. R.App. P. 35(a)(2). One such example is a case in which a panel decision \"conflicts with the authoritative decisions of other United States Courts of Appeals that have addressed the issue.\" Fed. R.App. P. 35(b)(1)(B). Of course, after this panel issues its opinion, Lewis may still move for rehearing en banc. <i>See</i> Fed. R.App. P. 40.</p>\n\n</div>",
