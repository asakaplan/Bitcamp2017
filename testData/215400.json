MARTIN, JR., Circuit Judge. Derrick Brown, a pro se federal\nprisoner with an unusually long history of abusive litigation, appeals from a district court\norder dismissing his civil action, purportedly filed as a 28 U.S.C. § 2241 habeas corpus\naction, for failure to prosecute, based on Brown’s failure to pay the required filing fee.\nThese consolidated cases have been referred to a panel of the court pursuant to Rule\n34(j)(1), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. The panel unanimously agrees that oral argument\nis not needed. See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a).\n\n\n\n\n                                             1\n\fNos. 08-5970/6107/6195         Brown v. Mills, et al.                               Page 2\n\n\n       On August 10, 2007, a federal jury convicted Brown of various drug and\nweapons offenses. On March 7, 2008, the district court sentenced him to a total of 387\nmonths of imprisonment, to be followed by six years of supervised release. On June 19,\n2009, we affirmed Brown’s conviction and sentence. United States v. Brown, Nos. 08-\n5319/5402/5515 (6th Cir. June 19, 2009).\n\n       While he was awaiting sentencing, Brown submitted a pro se complaint on a 28\nU.S.C. § 2241 habeas corpus form, asserting that officials at the privately-operated\nfacility where he was then incarcerated were denying him access to the courts by\nrestricting his access to legal materials, to the law library, and to telephone calls. He\nalso complained that various officials were refusing to respond to his grievances\nregarding these matters and that they were tampering with and destroying his legal and\nfamily mail. Brown described his complaint as a “civil tort action for civil right’s\nviolation” and sought damages.\n\n       On April 28, 2008, the district court issued an order construing the complaint as\na civil rights action filed pursuant to Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed.\nBureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388 (1971), and directing Brown to pay the full filing fee\nof $350 within ten days or face the dismissal of his action. The court noted that, in 2002,\nBrown was found to have accumulated three “strikes” under 28 U.S.C. § 1915(g) and\nwas no longer eligible to proceed in forma pauperis in the Western District of Tennessee.\nBy order dated July 16, 2008, the court noted that the April 28, 2008, order had been\nreturned undelivered because of Brown’s transfer to a federal correctional institution.\nThe court thus extended by ten days the time for Brown to submit the filing fee. Brown\nfiled a notice of appeal from the July 16, 2008, order, “extended from [the] order entered\non April 29, 2008.” That appeal was docketed as No. 08-5970.\n\n       On July 30, 2008, the district court ordered that Brown’s action be dismissed\nwithout prejudice for failure to prosecute, based on his failure to pay the filing fee.\nBrown’s appeal from this order was docketed as No. 08-6107. Brown’s motion for an\nextension of time to pay the filing fee was filed on July 31, 2008. Brown’s appeal from\nthe order denying this motion for an extension was docketed as No. 08-6195.\n\fNos. 08-5970/6107/6195         Brown v. Mills, et al.                               Page 3\n\n\n       Brown now argues that the district court erred by construing his § 2241 petition\nas a civil rights action without warning him of the consequences and without providing\nhim a chance to withdraw or amend his action. He summarily contends that he “was also\nchallenging the legality and the validity of his detention.” Brown further argues that the\ncourt abused its discretion by denying him leave to proceed in forma pauperis and by\ndenying him an extension of time to pay the fee.\n\n       We review for abuse of discretion a district court’s dismissal for failure to\nprosecute. Schafer v. City of Defiance Police Dep’t, 529 F.3d 731, 736 (6th Cir. 2008).\n“An abuse of discretion exists when the reviewing court is firmly convinced that a\nmistake has been made.” Id. at 736 (citation omitted).\n\n       The district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing Brown’s action. First,\nthe action was properly construed as a civil rights action rather than as a habeas action\nbecause Brown himself stated therein that he was asserting a “civil tort action for civil\nright’s violation,” he alleged violations of the First Amendment, and he sought monetary\ndamages. Insofar as Brown complains about the district court’s failure to warn him of\nthe consequences of its recharacterization of his action, the district court effectively\nwarned him about such consequences at length when it issued its § 1915(g) dismissal\norder in 2002. That order stated that Brown “shall not be permitted to file any further\nactions in forma pauperis without first obtaining leave of court,” and it explained in\npainstaking detail the steps Brown was to take in order “[t]o obtain leave of court.”\nBrown relies on Castro v. United States, 540 U.S. 375 (2003), for the proposition that\nthe district court was required to warn him about the consequences of recharacterization,\nbut Castro concerned the recharacterization of a civil rights complaint as a 28 U.S.C.\n§ 2255 motion to vacate, id. at 381-82, the opposite of the circumstances at issue in this\ncase. The concerns of Castro do not apply here.\n\n       Accordingly, Brown’s motions to proceed in forma pauperis are granted for the\npurposes of this appeal only. The district court’s orders are, however, affirmed.\n\f",
