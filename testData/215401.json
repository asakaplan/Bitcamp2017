MARTIN, JR., Circuit Judge. This matter is before the court upon\nconsideration of the motion filed by Correctional Medical Services, Inc.; Badawi\nAbdellatif, M.D.; and Craig Hutchinson, M.D., to dismiss appeal Nos. 10-2106 and 10-\n2467 for lack of jurisdiction. This court will address the motion only as it applies to\nappeal No. 10-2467 because this court on February 4, 2011 dismissed appeal No. 10-\n2106 for lack of jurisdiction.\n\n       It is argued in the motion to dismiss that this court lacks jurisdiction to hear\nappeals taken directly from magistrate judges’ decisions, that the order denying Michael\nGresham’s motion to intervene is not immediately appealable, and that there has not\n\n\n                                             1\n\fNo. 10-2467        Jones v. Correctional Medical Services, Inc., et al.             Page 2\n\n\nbeen a final decision entered in the case by the district court. Gresham responded in\nopposition stating that this court should remand the case so that he may participate in the\nupcoming trial, that he is asserting similar rights to those presented by Yvette Jones in\nthe pending 42 U.S.C. § 1983 civil rights action, that his appeal should not wait until the\ndistrict court case is adjudicated, and that the presentation of his claims of inadequate\nmedical treatment and abusive treatment by prison staff would support the claims made\nby Jones regarding the death of Raymond. E. Jones. Gresham also argues the merits of\nhis case.\n\n       Yvette Jones, as the personal representative of the estate of Raymond E. Jones,\nfiled a 42 U.S.C. § 1983 civil rights action in the district court on April 28, 2009. In\nDecember of 2009, the district court partially dismissed the case. On March 18, 2010,\nthe district court granted Jones’s motion for leave to amend the complaint.\n\n       In July of 2010, Gresham filed motions for joinder, for appointment of counsel,\nto amend the complaint in order to bring his own claims before the court, and to certify\nthe case as a class action. Jones opposed Gresham’s request to be joined as a plaintiff\nin the action. Gresham filed several more motions in the district court on July 22, 2010.\nOn August 2, 2010, the magistrate judge denied all of Gresham’s motions and struck his\nproposed pleadings after determining that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24 did not\nsupport Gresham’s attempts to incorporate his claims into the action brought by Jones.\n\n       On August 13, 2010, Gresham sought review of the magistrate judge’s ruling by\nthe district court, and by this court (appeal No. 10-2106). The district court judge\naffirmed the magistrate judge’s rulings by order entered on August 25, 2010.\n\n       On October 25, 2010, Gresham filed a document in the district court entitled\n“NOTICE OF APPEAL (ALSO) MOTION TO COMPELL [SIC] ATTORNEY\nGENERAL/U.S. DISTRICT COURT TO PROVIDE RECORDS OF ALL LOWER\nCOURT PROCEEDINGS . . . .” The district court docketed the October 25, 2010\ndocument from Gresham as a notice of appeal, and this court docketed it as appeal No.\n10-2467. On that document, Gresham listed both appeal No. 10-2106 and the district\ncourt civil action No. 09-00392. The notice of appeal appears to seek this court to direct\n\fNo. 10-2467        Jones v. Correctional Medical Services, Inc., et al.            Page 3\n\n\neither the attorney general or the district court to supply him with copies of all the\ndocuments filed in the district court.\n\n       This court has jurisdiction to review final decisions of the district court as\nprovided by 28 U.S.C. § 1291, but no final or appealable order terminating all the issues\npresented in the litigation has been entered by the district court. See Firestone Tire &\nRubber Co. v. Risjord, 449 U.S. 368, 373-75 (1981); Catlin v. United States, 324 U.S.\n229, 233-34 (1945); Bonner v. Perry, 564 F.3d 424, 426-28 (6th Cir. 2009). Nor has any\norder been entered which is immediately appealable under the “collateral order” doctrine\nannounced in Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., 337 U.S. 541 (1949). Moreover,\nGresham is not a party to the district court action, his October 25, 2010 notice of appeal\ndocketed as appeal No. 10-2467 does not seek review by this court of any specific order\nentered by the district court judge, and the notice of appeal was not filed within the\nappeal period of any order entered by the district court judge. See Fed. R. App. P. 4(a).\n\n       To the extent that the notice of appeal may be treated as a petition for a writ of\nmandamus, this court must deny relief. “The remedy of mandamus is a drastic one, to\nbe invoked only in extraordinary situations where the petitioner can show a clear and\nindisputable right to the relief sought.” In re Am. President Lines, Ltd., 929 F.2d 226,\n227 (6th Cir. 1991). Gresham has failed to show that he is entitled to be supplied copies\nof all the documents filed in district court action No. 09-00392.\n\n       It is ordered that appeal No. 10-2467 be dismissed, and the notice of appeal to\nthe extent it may be construed as a petition for a writ of mandamus is denied.\n\f",
