MARTIN, JR., Circuit Judge. Jerry and Dianne Randleman appeal\nthe district court’s decision to decertify the class in an action that they brought against\nFidelity National Title Insurance Company. The Randlemans allege that Fidelity failed\nto provide a discount, as required by its filed rates, when issuing title insurance to\nhomeowners who had purchased a title insurance policy for the same property from any\nother insurer within the previous ten years. Dean and Aimee Hickman brought an action\nalleging the same claims against First American Title Insurance Company, but the\ndistrict court denied their motion to certify a class. Neither district court abused its\ndiscretion in concluding that, as the classes are presently defined, common issues do not\npredominate. We therefore AFFIRM both orders.\n\n                                            I.\n\nA.     The Randlemans.\n\n       When Jerry and Dianne Randleman purchased a home in New London, Ohio in\n2001, they also purchased both a lender’s title insurance policy and an owner’s policy.\nIn 2004 the Randlemans refinanced their home and their new mortgagee required that\nthey purchase a new title insurance policy for its benefit. Fidelity issued the new policy\nbut failed to give the Randlemans the discounted “refinance” rate applicable when\nanother insurer has issued a title insurance policy on the property within the previous ten\nyears. The Randlemans assert that Fidelity overcharged them $213.57 by failing to\nprovide the discount.\n\n       Ohio law requires that Fidelity file its rates with the state, which it does through\nthe Ohio Title Insurance Rating Bureau. The Bureau filed a “Rate Manual” with Ohio,\n\fNos. 09-4533; 10-4242        Randleman, et al. v. Fidelity Nat’l                       Page 3\n                             Title Ins. Co., et al.\n\n\nwhich is binding on Fidelity, and requires that Fidelity charge a discounted premium rate\nfor policies issued in connection with refinancing transactions. This discount appears\nto be based on there being less risk to the current underwriter, and less investigation\nrequired, because some other entity has recently investigated and insured the title to the\nproperty. Provision PR-10 of the Rate Manual states:\n\n                When a refinance loan is made to the same borrower on the same\n        land, the following rate will be charged . . . provided the Insurer is given\n        a copy of the prior policy, or other information sufficient to enable the\n        Insurer to identify such prior policy upon which reissue is requested, and\n        the amount of the unpaid principal balance secured by the original loan:\n\n                     Age of Original Loan             Policy Rates\n                   10 years or under             70% of original rate\n                   Over 10 years                 100% of original rate\n\nProvision PR-9 of the Rate Manual is similarly worded and offers the same thirty percent\ndiscount to homeowners who purchased an owner’s title insurance policy for the\nproperty within the previous ten years.\n\n        Although the Randlemans’ prior title insurance purchase made them eligible for\nthis discount, they were unaware it existed. Consequently, the Randlemans never\nrequested the discount or submitted the necessary documentation to establish that they\nhad recently purchased title insurance. After considering all of the requirements for\nclass certification in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23, the district court, pursuant to\nRule 23(b)(3), initially certified a class consisting of:\n\n        All persons who (i) paid for title insurance issued by defendant Fidelity\n        National Title Insurance Company in connection with the refinancing of\n        a residential mortgage loan on property located in Ohio that was\n        completed on or after February 15, 2000, (ii) were entitled to receive the\n        “reissue” or “refinance” rate for title insurance pursuant to Section 8 or\n        Section 9 of the Filed Rates (for transactions prior to February 1, 2002)\n        or PR-9 or PR-10 of the Filed Rates (for transactions February 1, 2002\n        to the present), and (iii) paid more than the “reissue” or “refinance” rate\n        for such title insurance.\n\fNos. 09-4533; 10-4242       Randleman, et al. v. Fidelity Nat’l                     Page 4\n                            Title Ins. Co., et al.\n\n\n       Because Fidelity must have received a copy of the prior policy or the file must\nhave contained “other information sufficient to enable [Fidelity] to identify such prior\npolicy upon which reissue is requested” in order for the individual to be eligible to\nreceive the discount, the key question as this litigation is currently framed and the class\nis defined is what each application for title insurance contained. The district court’s\ninitial conclusion that this question is common to all class members and predominates\nover all other issues was based largely on its view that “a prior mortgage invariably, or\nnearly so invariably as to make any variation meaningless, meant that a prior policy had\nissued.” Randleman v. Fidelity Nat’l Title Ins. Co., 264 F.R.D. 298, 303 (N.D. Ohio\n2009). However, after the district court certified the class, the parties engaged in rather\nextensive discovery and deposed representatives from various Ohio lenders about their\npractices and use of title insurance. Fidelity established that mortgagees can, and\napparently often do, rely on opinion letters from attorneys or title guarantees in lieu of\npurchasing title insurance. This evidence established that the district court’s earlier\npresumption about the ubiquity of title insurance in mortgage transactions was incorrect:\na prior mortgage in the chain of title would not have given Fidelity notice that the\nhomeowner had previously purchased title insurance. The district court accordingly\nreasoned that liability could only be determined on an individual basis by examining\neach individual homeowner’s file. Therefore, the district court concluded that the\nputative class failed to meet the commonality or typicality requirements necessary to\nsustain a class action. Additionally, in light of the individual analysis necessary to\ndetermine liability, the district court concluded that common issues did not predominate.\n\nB.     The Hickmans.\n\n       When Dean and Aimee Hickman purchased a home in Elyria, Ohio in 1999 they\nalso purchased both a lender’s title insurance policy and an owner’s policy. The\nHickmans then refinanced their home in 2001 and again in 2004. The Hickmans\npurchased a new title insurance policy for each transaction, with First American issuing\nthe 2004 policy. The Hickmans were apparently unaware that they were eligible to\nreceive the refinance discount, and there is no evidence that they requested the discount\n\fNos. 09-4533; 10-4242       Randleman, et al. v. Fidelity Nat’l                      Page 5\n                            Title Ins. Co., et al.\n\n\nor submitted documentation to First American establishing that they had previously\npurchased title insurance. The Hickmans claim that by not providing the discount First\nAmerican overcharged them $134.40.\n\n       First American, like Fidelity, files its rates through the Ohio Title Insurance\nRating Bureau and is subject to provisions PR-9 and PR-10, which provide the\n“refinance discount” of thirty percent when issuing a title insurance policy if some other\ntitle insurer has issued a policy for the property in the previous ten years.\n\n       The Hickmans proposed that the district court certify a class of:\n\n       All persons who (i) paid for a lender’s policy of title insurance issued by\n       defendant First American Title Insurance Company in connection with\n       the refinancing of a residential mortgage loan on property located in\n       Ohio that was completed on or after February 2, 2000; (ii) where the\n       subject property previously had been mortgaged within the applicable\n       look-back period; and (iii) paid more than the discounted “reissue” or\n       “refinance” rate for such title insurance.\n\nUnlike the Randlemans’ proposed class, membership in the Hickmans’ class does not\nturn on an individual’s “entitlement” to receive the discount, but includes all individuals\nwho refinanced a mortgage within the ten-year look-back period.\n\n       The district court considered the requirements in Rule 23 for certifying a class\naction and concluded that the Hickmans’ proposed class failed to meet the commonality\nor typicality requirements. Additionally, the district court held that even if the\ncommonality requirement of Rule 23(a) were met, common questions did not\npredominate as required to maintain a class action under Rule 23(b)(3). Thus, the\ndistrict court denied the motion for class certification.\n\fNos. 09-4533; 10-4242       Randleman, et al. v. Fidelity Nat’l                     Page 6\n                            Title Ins. Co., et al.\n\n\n                                            II.\n\nA.     Standard of Review.\n\n       This Court reviews a district court’s decision to deny class certification for abuse\nof discretion. Ball v. Union Carbide Corp., 385 F.3d 713, 727 (6th Cir. 2004). “The\ndistrict court maintains substantial discretion in determining whether to certify a class,\nas it possesses the inherent power to manage and control its own pending litigation.”\nReeb v. Ohio Dep’t of Rehab. & Corr., 435 F.3d 639, 643 (6th Cir. 2006). “The district\ncourt’s decision certifying the class is subject to a very limited review and will be\nreversed only upon a strong showing that the district court’s decision was a clear abuse\nof discretion.” Beattie v. CenturyTel, Inc., 511 F.3d 554, 559-60 (6th Cir. 2007)\n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). “A district court abuses its discretion\nwhen [it] relies on erroneous findings of fact, applies the wrong legal standard,\nmisapplies the correct legal standard when reaching a conclusion, or makes a clear error\nof judgment.” Id. at 560 (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks and citation\nomitted).\n\n       Although this Court has not previously addressed the standard of review\napplicable to orders decertifying classes, other circuits use the same, highly deferential,\nabuse-of-discretion review applied to certification orders. See, e.g., Voss v. Rolland, 592\nF.3d 242, 245-46 (1st Cir. 2010); Pierce v. Cnty. of Orange, 526 F.3d 1190, 1200 (9th\nCir. 2008); Birmingham Steel Corp. v. Tenn. Valley Auth., 353 F.3d 1331, 1335 (11th\nCir. 2003). Applying this same standard of review is also consistent with the district\ncourt’s continuing obligation to ensure that the class certification requirements are met,\nand with the district court’s ability to alter or amend the certification order as\ncircumstances change and the parties’ litigation strategies evolve. See Barney v. Holzer\nClinic, Ltd., 110 F.3d 1207, 1214 (6th Cir. 1997); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(1)(C).\nTherefore, we will also review the order decertifying the class action in Randleman for\nabuse of discretion.\n\fNos. 09-4533; 10-4242             Randleman, et al. v. Fidelity Nat’l                               Page 7\n                                  Title Ins. Co., et al.\n\n\nB.       Whether the District Courts Abused Their Discretion by Concluding that\n         Common Issues Do Not Predominate.\n         In light of the relatively small sums of money involved in each individual\ntransaction, a class action appears to be the only way in which homeowners who were\nimproperly denied the discount on title insurance may be able to recover. However,\nunder the plaintiffs’ theory of liability and proposed class definitions, neither district\ncourt abused its discretion by concluding that common issues do not predominate and\nrefusing to allow class-wide litigation to proceed.1\n\n1.       The Randlemans.\n\n         The class the district court initially certified was flawed in that it only included\nthose who are “entitled to relief.” This is an improper fail-safe class that shields the\nputative class members from receiving an adverse judgment. Either the class members\nwin or, by virtue of losing, they are not in the class and, therefore, not bound by the\njudgment.2 See Genenbacher v. Centurytel Fiber Co. II, LLC, 244 F.R.D. 485, 488\n(C.D. Ill. 2007); see also Campbell v. First Am. Title Ins. Co., 269 F.R.D. 68, 73-74 (D.\nMe. 2010) (revising the class definition to avoid “the ‘fail safe’ issue”); Slapikas v. First\nAm. Title Ins. Co., 250 F.R.D. 232, 25-51 (W.D. Pa. 2008) (same). Although this is an\nindependent ground for denying class certification, the district court also did not abuse\nits discretion in decertifying the Randlemans’ class based on its conclusion that common\nissues do not predominate.\n\n         In addition to the numerosity, commonality, typicality and adequacy prerequisites\nnecessary for all class actions, Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a), in order to bring a damages class\naction under Rule 23(b)(3) the court must find that common questions predominate and\n\n\n         1\n          Both district courts also held that the putative classes did not meet the commonality or typicality\nrequirements. However, because we hold that the district courts did not abuse their discretion in\nconcluding that the predominance requirement is unsatisfied, we do not address whether the district courts\nabused their discretion in finding these other requirements unsatisfied.\n         2\n          While we cannot redefine the class on appeal, at oral argument, counsel argued for a class like\nthat proposed in the Hickman case, where membership included all those who purchased title insurance\nfor a property that had a prior mortgage within the look-back period.\n\fNos. 09-4533; 10-4242       Randleman, et al. v. Fidelity Nat’l                     Page 8\n                            Title Ins. Co., et al.\n\n\nthat a class action is a superior way to resolve the controversy, Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3).\nTo meet the predominance requirement, a plaintiff must establish that issues subject to\ngeneralized proof and applicable to the class as a whole predominate over those issues\nthat are subject to only individualized proof. Beattie, 511 F.3d at 564.\n\n       The district court initially certified the class assuming that Fidelity would have\ndiscovered a prior mortgage in the process of issuing title insurance, and a prior\nmortgage necessarily means that the applicant purchased title insurance in connection\nwith that prior mortgage. Randleman, 264 F.R.D. at 304. If this presumption held up,\nit may have been possible to maintain a class action with the common issue being\nwhether a prior mortgage is sufficient “other information” to qualify for the discount.\nHowever, after Fidelity established through discovery that title insurance is not\nnecessarily—or even usually—purchased in connection with mortgages in Ohio, the\ndistrict court concluded that common issues do not predominate. Id. Consistent with\nthis revelation, district courts in Ohio considering similar class actions brought against\nother title insurers have all concluded that common issues do not predominate and have\neither denied class certification or decertified classes. See Hickman v. First Am. Title\nIns. Co., No. 07-cv-1543, 2010 WL 3075157, at *5 (N.D. Ohio Aug. 5, 2010); Chesner\nv. Stewart Title Guar. Co., No. 06-cv-476, 2009 WL 585823, at *8 (N.D. Ohio Jan. 9,\n2009); Macula v. Lawyers Title Ins. Corp., 264 F.R.D. 307, 311 (N.D. Ohio 2009).\n\n       In light of how the Randlemans have framed the issues and defined the class,\nwithout the initial presumption, determining liability would require an examination of\neach individual policy Fidelity issued to determine if Fidelity had received a copy of the\nprior policy or “other information” suggesting that a policy had previously been issued.\nUnder this framework, establishing that Fidelity received this information is essential to\nproving liability and, as the district court found, a highly individual inquiry. Similarly,\nin a lawsuit alleging nearly identical claims against a title insurer in Texas, the Fifth\nCircuit recently recognized that determining an individual’s eligibility to receive the\nrefinance discount is highly individual and affirmed a district court’s decision denying\nclass certification based on a failure to meet the predominance requirement. See\n\fNos. 09-4533; 10-4242        Randleman, et al. v. Fidelity Nat’l                      Page 9\n                             Title Ins. Co., et al.\n\n\nBenavides v. Chicago Title Ins. Co., – F.3d —, 2011 WL 1107009, at *3-4 (5th Cir.\nMarch 23, 2011). Therefore, because the Randlemans have defined the class and\npresented their claim in a manner that requires substantial, individual inquiries, the\ndistrict court’s decision decertifying the class was not an abuse of discretion.\n\n        While the need to prove damages or establish class membership on an individual\nbasis is not fatal to class certification, liability is a central issue in this matter and the\nRandlemans’ claims can only be determined on an individual basis. In Beattie, for\nexample, this Court affirmed a district court’s order certifying a class under Rule\n23(b)(3) alleging that the defendant violated federal and state law by engaging in\ndeceptive billing practices. 511 F.3d at 559, 568. The central issue in Beattie was\nwhether the defendant’s billing practices were deceptive, which was common to all\nsubscribers. Id. at 565-66. Although each plaintiff would need to show damages\nindividually, we held that the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that\nthe class-wide issue of whether the defendant’s billing was deceptive predominated over\nindividual issues. Id. at 566.\n\n        Similarly, the need to prove entitlement to participate in the class on an\nindividual basis will also not necessarily mean that common issues do not predominate.\nIn Daffin v. Ford Motor Co., 458 F.3d 549, 550-51 (6th Cir. 2006), this Court affirmed\na district court’s order certifying a class alleging breach of an express warranty based\non allegedly defective throttle body assemblies in certain Mercury Villager minivans.\nThe district court concluded that the common questions of whether the throttle body was\ndefective, whether the defect reduces the value of the car, and whether the defect is\ncovered by the express warranty predominated over any individual issues. Id. at 554.\nAlthough each individual would, after the common issues were litigated, need to\nestablish that he or she owned the relevant vehicle during the relevant time period, we\naffirmed the district court’s conclusion that common issues predominated.                  Id.\nImportantly, both the district court’s opinion and our holding were premised on a notion\nthat individuals who owned the car were injured even if they had not personally\nexperienced a stuck throttle body. Id. at 552-54. And, we noted that the district court\n\fNos. 09-4533; 10-4242        Randleman, et al. v. Fidelity Nat’l                     Page 10\n                             Title Ins. Co., et al.\n\n\nmay need to reconsider whether a class can be maintained if it turned out that only\nindividuals who actually had a stuck throttle body during the warranty period were\nentitled to recover. Id. at 554.\n\n        The Randlemans attempt to fit their claim within Beattie and Daffin, but the\nrequirements in the Ohio rate rules necessitate substantial, individual inquiries to\ndetermine liability under their theory of the case and class definition that are\nincompatible with the predominance requirement of Rule 23(b)(3). Unlike these claims,\nliability in Beattie could be determined on a class-wide basis: if the billing practices\nwere deceptive, they would be deceptive for all class members. Id. at 564; accord\nHohinder v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 574 F.3d 169, 184-85 (3d Cir. 2009) (recognizing\nthat the existence of discriminatory policies could be proven on a class-wide basis, but\nreversing order certifying a class action because class-wide liability required individual\ninquiries incompatible with the requirements in Rule 23). Unlike these claims, in Daffin\nliability could be determined on a class-wide basis and a class member could establish\nhis or her entitlement to participate in the litigation merely by submitting proof that he\nor she owned the car during the time period. If the rate rules provided the discount to\nanyone who previously purchased title insurance, and did not contain a notice\nrequirement, such that a homeowner could recover merely by presenting evidence that\nhe or she had previously purchased a title insurance policy for the property in question\nwithin the preceding ten years then, under the Randlemans’ theory of the case, a district\ncourt might be within its discretion to certify a class. In that situation, the homeowners\ncould establish their eligibility to participate in the class in a manner similar to the class\nmembers in Beattie and Daffin. However, the rate rules require that Fidelity had notice\nof the prior policy in order to receive the discount. Therefore, under the Randlemans’\ncurrent theory of the case, presenting a prior policy at this time is not enough to establish\nthat Fidelity wrongfully denied the discount. The only way to resolve these particular\nclaims and establish whether Fidelity improperly refused to give the refinance discount\nis to consider what Fidelity knew about each individual transaction at the time it issued\na policy by examining each individual transaction. Accordingly, we cannot conclude\n\fNos. 09-4533; 10-4242       Randleman, et al. v. Fidelity Nat’l                    Page 11\n                            Title Ins. Co., et al.\n\n\nthat the district court abused its discretion by concluding that common issues do not\npredominate and decertifying the class.\n\n       Some district courts in other jurisdictions have certified similar class actions but,\nin those states, mortgagees appear to regularly require title insurance and it may be\nreasonable to presume that a prior recorded mortgage constitutes sufficient “other\ninformation” to warrant giving the reissue discount. For example, recent revisions to the\nrate manual in Pennsylvania provide that the refinance rate applies if the title search\nreveals a prior mortgage from an institutional lender or even just a prior deed to a bona\nfide purchaser for value. Slapikas, 250 F.R.D. at 235-36. Similarly, in Maine, there is\nsome evidence to suggest that most institutional lenders require title insurance.\nCampbell, 269 F.R.D. at 72-73. In both of those states, because of how mortgages are\nhandled, district courts found that classes could be certified. See generally id. at 80;\nSlapikas, 250 F.R.D. at 251. However, Fidelity established, and the district courts\nagreed, that lenders in Ohio do not regularly require title insurance. Therefore, these\nother district court opinions are not persuasive because they deal with very different\nfactual circumstances. In Ohio, under the Randlemans’ theory of the case, each\nhomeowner’s entitlement to the discount rate turns on an individual case-by-case\nanalysis, and the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that common\nissues do not predominate and decertifying the class.\n\n2.     The Hickmans.\n\n       Similarly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the Hickmans’\nmotion for class certification. For the same reasons that the Randlemans failed to\nestablish that common issues predominate, the Hickmans also did not establish that\ncommon issues predominate with respect to the class they proposed, and the district\ncourt’s decision to deny class certification was not an abuse of discretion.\n\fNos. 09-4533; 10-4242           Randleman, et al. v. Fidelity Nat’l                         Page 12\n                                Title Ins. Co., et al.\n\n\nC.      Whether the District Court Abused Its Discretion by Not Adopting the\n        Randlemans’ Proposed Case Management Plan.\n        The Randlemans argue that any individual issues could be resolved easily\nthrough creative case management procedures. They outline a multistep process that,\nin their view, would have enabled the district court to resolve these claims on a class-\nwide basis.3 District courts have broad discretion in determining whether to bifurcate\nproceedings or divide a class action into subclasses. See In re Ins. Brokerage Antitrust\nLitig., 579 F.3d 241, 271 (3d Cir. 2009); Williams v. Mohawk Indus., Inc., 568 F.3d\n1350, 1355 (11th Cir. 2009); see also Beattie, 511 F.3d at 559 (noting the district court’s\ndiscretion to certify a class in light of its inherent power to manage and control\nlitigation). The district court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to adopt the\nRandlemans’ plan because it would not have more easily permitted class-wide resolution\nof these issues. Essentially, the proposed procedure would have been more discovery\nto determine which lending institutions require that mortgagors purchase title insurance,\nfollowed by a trial on the class-wide issues of liability.                   However, even this\nformulation—which the Randlemans presumably framed in a manner to minimize\nindividual issues and to emphasize those susceptible to class-wide resolution—would\nstill require substantial, individual inquiries.\n\n        For example, the Randlemans assert that one of the purportedly class-wide issues\nto resolve at trial under their plan is whether “information in a particular property’s chain\nof title” is sufficient “other information” to qualify the homeowner for the discount.\nThis is a highly individualized inquiry into each particular property. Because the\nRandlemans’ case management plan still requires resolving numerous individual issues,\nwe find no abuse of discretion in the district court’s decision not to adopt it.\n\n        Additionally, Fidelity argues that subclassing and bifurcation cannot be used to\novercome a lack of predominance. Some other circuits have adopted this view and held\nthat creative subclassing and bifurcation procedures cannot be used to remedy a lack of\n\n\n        3\n          The Hickmans did not propose a case management plan to the district court and, therefore, do\nnot argue that the district court abused its discretion in refusing to adopt one.\n\fNos. 09-4533; 10-4242       Randleman, et al. v. Fidelity Nat’l                   Page 13\n                            Title Ins. Co., et al.\n\n\npredominance. See, e.g., Sacred Heart Health Sys., Inc. v. Humana Military Healthcare\nServs., Inc., 601 F.3d 1159, 1176 (11th Cir. 2010); Castano v. Am. Tobacco Co., 84 F.3d\n734, 745 & n.20 (5th Cir. 1996); see also Gunnells v. Healthplan Servs., Inc., 348 F.3d\n417, 446-47 (4th Cir. 2003) (Niemeyer, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).\nHowever, other circuits see no such barrier and allow subclassing as long as common\nissues predominate over the subclasses. See, e.g., In re Nassau Cnty. Strip Search Cases,\n461 F.3d 219, 226 (2d Cir. 2006); Gunnells, 348 F.3d at 439; Valentino v. Carter-\nWallace, Inc., 97 F.3d 1227, 1234 (9th Cir. 1996). The Sixth Circuit has not yet weighed\nin on this issue and we do not at this time because even under the Randlemans’ proposed\nsubclassing plan, common issues still do not predominate.\n\n                                           III.\n\n       The relatively small amount of money that each individual plaintiff could\npossibly recover suggests that a class action is the only real meaningful way to afford\nrelief in this case. While our holding does not extend to a class that might be differently\ndefined to satisfy the requirements in Rule 23, as these claims are presented and classes\nare defined, resolving each individual homeowner’s entitlement to the refinance rate\nrequires a highly individual inquiry. Therefore, the district courts did not abuse their\ndiscretion in concluding that the claims presented in these two putative classes are not\namenable to class-wide resolution. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district courts’\ndecisions.\n\f",

MARTIN, JR., Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>Jerry and Dianne Randleman appeal the district court's decision to decertify the class in an action that they brought against Fidelity National Title Insurance Company. The Randlemans allege that Fidelity failed to provide a discount, as required by its filed rates, when issuing title insurance to homeowners who had purchased a title insurance policy for the same property from any other insurer within the previous ten years. Dean and Aimee Hickman brought an action alleging the same claims against First American Title Insurance Company, but the district court denied their motion to certify a class. Neither district court abused its discretion in concluding that, as the classes are presently defined, common issues do not predominate. We therefore AFFIRM both orders.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. The Randlemans.</h2>\n<p>When Jerry and Dianne Randleman purchased a home in New London, Ohio in 2001, they also purchased both a lender's title insurance policy and an owner's policy. In 2004 the Randlemans refinanced their home and their new mortgagee required that they purchase a new title insurance policy for its benefit. Fidelity issued the new policy but failed to give the Randlemans the discounted \"refinance\" rate applicable when another insurer has issued a title insurance policy on the property within the previous ten years. The Randlemans assert that Fidelity overcharged them $213.57 by failing to provide the discount.</p>\n<p>Ohio law requires that Fidelity file its rates with the state, which it does through the Ohio Title Insurance Rating Bureau. The Bureau filed a \"Rate Manual\" with Ohio, which is binding on Fidelity, and requires that Fidelity charge a discounted premium rate for policies issued in connection with refinancing transactions. This discount appears to be based on there being less risk to the current underwriter, and less investigation required, because some other entity has recently investigated <span class=\"star-pagination\">*350</span> and insured the title to the property. Provision PR-10 of the Rate Manual states:</p>\n<blockquote>When a refinance loan is made to the same borrower on the same land, the following rate will be charged . . . provided the Insurer is given a copy of the prior policy, or other information sufficient to enable the Insurer to identify such prior policy upon which reissue is requested, and the amount of the unpaid principal balance secured by the original loan:</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<pre>\n  Age of Original Loan  Policy Rates\n  --------------------  -------------\n  10 years or under     70% of original rate\n  Over 10 years         100% of original rate\n</pre>\n<p>Provision PR-9 of the Rate Manual is similarly worded and offers the same thirty percent discount to homeowners who purchased an owner's title insurance policy for the property within the previous ten years.</p>\n<p>Although the Randlemans' prior title insurance purchase made them eligible for this discount, they were unaware it existed. Consequently, the Randlemans never requested the discount or submitted the necessary documentation to establish that they had recently purchased title insurance. After considering all of the requirements for class certification in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23, the district court, pursuant to Rule 23(b)(3), initially certified a class consisting of:</p>\n<blockquote>All persons who (i) paid for title insurance issued by defendant Fidelity National Title Insurance Company in connection with the refinancing of a residential mortgage loan on property located in Ohio that was completed on or after February 15, 2000, (ii) were entitled to receive the \"reissue\" or \"refinance\" rate for title insurance pursuant to Section 8 or Section 9 of the Filed Rates (for transactions prior to February 1, 2002) or PR-9 or PR-10 of the Filed Rates (for transactions February 1, 2002 to the present), and (iii) paid more than the \"reissue\" or \"refinance\" rate for such title insurance.</blockquote>\n<p>Because Fidelity must have received a copy of the prior policy or the file must have contained \"other information sufficient to enable [Fidelity] to identify such prior policy upon which reissue is requested\" in order for the individual to be eligible to receive the discount, the key question as this litigation is currently framed and the class is defined is what each application for title insurance contained. The district court's initial conclusion that this question is common to all class members and predominates over all other issues was based largely on its view that \"a prior mortgage invariably, or nearly so invariably as to make any variation meaningless, meant that a prior policy had issued.\" <i>Randleman v. Fidelity Nat'l Title Ins. Co.,</i> 264 F.R.D. 298, 303 (N.D.Ohio 2009). However, after the district court certified the class, the parties engaged in rather extensive discovery and deposed representatives from various Ohio lenders about their practices and use of title insurance. Fidelity established that mortgagees can, and apparently often do, rely on opinion letters from attorneys or title guarantees in lieu of purchasing title insurance. This evidence established that the district court's earlier presumption about the ubiquity of title insurance in mortgage transactions was incorrect: a prior mortgage in the chain of title would not have given Fidelity notice that the homeowner had previously purchased title insurance. The district court accordingly reasoned that liability could only be determined on an individual basis by examining each individual homeowner's file. Therefore, the district court concluded that the putative class failed to meet the commonality or typicality requirements necessary to sustain a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*351</span> class action. Additionally, in light of the individual analysis necessary to determine liability, the district court concluded that common issues did not predominate.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. The Hickmans.</h2>\n<p>When Dean and Aimee Hickman purchased a home in Elyria, Ohio in 1999 they also purchased both a lender's title insurance policy and an owner's policy. The Hickmans then refinanced their home in 2001 and again in 2004. The Hickmans purchased a new title insurance policy for each transaction, with First American issuing the 2004 policy. The Hickmans were apparently unaware that they were eligible to receive the refinance discount, and there is no evidence that they requested the discount or submitted documentation to First American establishing that they had previously purchased title insurance. The Hickmans claim that by not providing the discount First American overcharged them $134.40.</p>\n<p>First American, like Fidelity, files its rates through the Ohio Title Insurance Rating Bureau and is subject to provisions PR-9 and PR-10, which provide the \"refinance discount\" of thirty percent when issuing a title insurance policy if some other title insurer has issued a policy for the property in the previous ten years.</p>\n<p>The Hickmans proposed that the district court certify a class of:</p>\n<blockquote>All persons who (i) paid for a lender's policy of title insurance issued by defendant First American Title Insurance Company in connection with the refinancing of a residential mortgage loan on property located in Ohio that was completed on or after February 2, 2000; (ii) where the subject property previously had been mortgaged within the applicable look-back period; and (iii) paid more than the discounted \"reissue\" or \"refinance\" rate for such title insurance.</blockquote>\n<p>Unlike the Randlemans' proposed class, membership in the Hickmans' class does not turn on an individual's \"entitlement\" to receive the discount, but includes all individuals who refinanced a mortgage within the ten-year look-back period.</p>\n<p>The district court considered the requirements in Rule 23 for certifying a class action and concluded that the Hickmans' proposed class failed to meet the commonality or typicality requirements. Additionally, the district court held that even if the commonality requirement of Rule 23(a) were met, common questions did not predominate as required to maintain a class action under Rule 23(b)(3). Thus, the district court denied the motion for class certification.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Standard of Review.</h2>\n<p>This Court reviews a district court's decision to deny class certification for abuse of discretion. <i>Ball v. Union Carbide Corp.,</i> 385 F.3d 713, 727 (6th Cir. 2004). \"The district court maintains substantial discretion in determining whether to certify a class, as it possesses the inherent power to manage and control its own pending litigation.\" <i>Reeb v. Ohio Dep't of Rehab. &amp; Corr.,</i> 435 F.3d 639, 643 (6th Cir.2006). \"The district court's decision certifying the class is subject to a very limited review and will be reversed only upon a strong showing that the district court's decision was a clear abuse of discretion.\" <i>Beattie v. CenturyTel, Inc.,</i> 511 F.3d 554, 559-60 (6th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \"A district court abuses its discretion when [it] relies on erroneous findings of fact, applies the wrong legal standard, misapplies the correct legal standard when reaching a conclusion, or makes a clear error of judgment.\" <i>Id.</i> at 560 (alteration <span class=\"star-pagination\">*352</span> in original) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p>Although this Court has not previously addressed the standard of review applicable to orders decertifying classes, other circuits use the same, highly deferential, abuse-of-discretion review applied to certification orders. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Voss v. Rolland,</i> 592 F.3d 242, 245-46 (1st Cir.2010); <i>Pierce v. Cnty. of Orange,</i> 526 F.3d 1190, 1200 (9th Cir.2008); <i>Birmingham Steel Corp. v. Tenn. Valley Auth.,</i> 353 F.3d 1331, 1335 (11th Cir.2003). Applying this same standard of review is also consistent with the district court's continuing obligation to ensure that the class certification requirements are met, and with the district court's ability to alter or amend the certification order as circumstances change and the parties' litigation strategies evolve. <i>See </i><i>Barney v. Holzer Clinic, Ltd.,</i> 110 F.3d 1207, 1214 (6th Cir.1997); <i>see also</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(c)(1)(C). Therefore, we will also review the order decertifying the class action in <i>Randleman</i> for abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Whether the District Courts Abused Their Discretion by Concluding that Common Issues Do Not Predominate.</h2>\n<p>In light of the relatively small sums of money involved in each individual transaction, a class action appears to be the only way in which homeowners who were improperly denied the discount on title insurance may be able to recover. However, under the plaintiffs' theory of liability and proposed class definitions, neither district court abused its discretion by concluding that common issues do not predominate and refusing to allow class-wide litigation to proceed.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. The Randlemans.</h2>\n<p>The class the district court initially certified was flawed in that it only included those who are \"entitled to relief.\" This is an improper fail-safe class that shields the putative class members from receiving an adverse judgment. Either the class members win or, by virtue of losing, they are not in the class and, therefore, not bound by the judgment.<sup>[2]</sup><i>See </i><i>Genenbacher v. CenturyTel Fiber Co. II, LLC,</i> 244 F.R.D. 485, 488 (C.D.Ill.2007); <i>see also Campbell v. First Am. Title Ins. Co.,</i> 269 F.R.D. 68, 73-74 (D.Me.2010) (revising the class definition to avoid \"the `fail safe' issue\"); <i>Slapikas v. First Am. Title Ins. Co.,</i> 250 F.R.D. 232, 250-51 (W.D.Pa.2008) (same). Although this is an independent ground for denying class certification, the district court also did not abuse its discretion in decertifying the Randlemans' class based on its conclusion that common issues do not predominate.</p>\n<p>In addition to the numerosity, commonality, typicality and adequacy prerequisites necessary for all class actions, Fed. R.Civ.P. 23(a), in order to bring a damages class action under Rule 23(b)(3) the court must find that common questions predominate and that a class action is a superior way to resolve the controversy, Fed. R.Civ.P. 23(b)(3). To meet the predominance <span class=\"star-pagination\">*353</span> requirement, a plaintiff must establish that issues subject to generalized proof and applicable to the class as a whole predominate over those issues that are subject to only individualized proof. <i>Beattie,</i> 511 F.3d at 564.</p>\n<p>The district court initially certified the class assuming that Fidelity would have discovered a prior mortgage in the process of issuing title insurance, and a prior mortgage necessarily means that the applicant purchased title insurance in connection with that prior mortgage. <i>Randleman,</i> 264 F.R.D. at 304. If this presumption held up, it may have been possible to maintain a class action with the common issue being whether a prior mortgage is sufficient \"other information\" to qualify for the discount. However, after Fidelity established through discovery that title insurance is not necessarilyor even usuallypurchased in connection with mortgages in Ohio, the district court concluded that common issues do not predominate. <i>Id.</i> Consistent with this revelation, district courts in Ohio considering similar class actions brought against other title insurers have all concluded that common issues do not predominate and have either denied class certification or decertified classes. <i>See Hickman v. First Am. Title Ins. Co.,</i> No. 07-cv-1543, 2010 WL 3075157, at *5 (N.D.Ohio Aug.5, 2010); <i>Chesner v. Stewart Title Guar. Co.,</i> No. 06-cv-476, 2009 WL 585823, at *8 (N.D.Ohio Jan.9, 2009); <i>Macula v. Lawyers Title Ins. Corp.,</i> 264 F.R.D. 307, 311 (N.D.Ohio 2009).</p>\n<p>In light of how the Randlemans have framed the issues and defined the class, without the initial presumption, determining liability would require an examination of each individual policy Fidelity issued to determine if Fidelity had received a copy of the prior policy or \"other information\" suggesting that a policy had previously been issued. Under this framework, establishing that Fidelity received this information is essential to proving liability and, as the district court found, a highly individual inquiry. Similarly, in a lawsuit alleging nearly identical claims against a title insurer in Texas, the Fifth Circuit recently recognized that determining an individual's eligibility to receive the refinance discount is highly individual and affirmed a district court's decision denying class certification based on a failure to meet the predominance requirement. <i>See </i><i>Benavides v. Chicago Title Ins. Co.,</i> 636 F.3d 699, 701-03 (5th Cir.2011). Therefore, because the Randlemans have defined the class and presented their claim in a manner that requires substantial, individual inquiries, the district court's decision decertifying the class was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p>While the need to prove damages or establish class membership on an individual basis is not fatal to class certification, liability is a central issue in this matter and the Randlemans' claims can only be determined on an individual basis. In <i>Beattie,</i> for example, this Court affirmed a district court's order certifying a class under Rule 23(b)(3) alleging that the defendant violated federal and state law by engaging in deceptive billing practices. 511 F.3d at 559, 568. The central issue in <i>Beattie</i> was whether the defendant's billing practices were deceptive, which was common to all subscribers. <i>Id.</i> at 565-66. Although each plaintiff would need to show damages individually, we held that the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the class-wide issue of whether the defendant's billing was deceptive predominated over individual issues. <i>Id.</i> at 566.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the need to prove entitlement to participate in the class on an individual basis will also not necessarily mean that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*354</span> common issues do not predominate. In <i>Daffin v. Ford Motor Co.,</i> 458 F.3d 549, 550-51 (6th Cir.2006), this Court affirmed a district court's order certifying a class alleging breach of an express warranty based on allegedly defective throttle body assemblies in certain Mercury Villager minivans. The district court concluded that the common questions of whether the throttle body was defective, whether the defect reduces the value of the car, and whether the defect is covered by the express warranty predominated over any individual issues. <i>Id.</i> at 554. Although each individual would, after the common issues were litigated, need to establish that he or she owned the relevant vehicle during the relevant time period, we affirmed the district court's conclusion that common issues predominated. <i>Id.</i> Importantly, both the district court's opinion and our holding were premised on a notion that individuals who owned the car were injured even if they had not personally experienced a stuck throttle body. <i>Id.</i> at 552-54. And, we noted that the district court may need to reconsider whether a class can be maintained if it turned out that only individuals who actually had a stuck throttle body during the warranty period were entitled to recover. <i>Id.</i> at 554.</p>\n<p>The Randlemans attempt to fit their claim within <i>Beattie</i> and <i>Daffin,</i> but the requirements in the Ohio rate rules necessitate substantial, individual inquiries to determine liability under their theory of the case and class definition that are incompatible with the predominance requirement of Rule 23(b)(3). Unlike these claims, liability in <i>Beattie</i> could be determined on a class-wide basis: if the billing practices were deceptive, they would be deceptive for all class members. <i>Id.</i> at 564; <i>accord </i><i>Hohinder v. United Parcel Serv., Inc.,</i> 574 F.3d 169, 184-85 (3d Cir. 2009) (recognizing that the existence of discriminatory policies could be proven on a class-wide basis, but reversing order certifying a class action because class-wide liability required individual inquiries incompatible with the requirements in Rule 23). Unlike these claims, in <i>Daffin</i> liability could be determined on a class-wide basis and a class member could establish his or her entitlement to participate in the litigation merely by submitting proof that he or she owned the car during the time period. If the rate rules provided the discount to anyone who previously purchased title insurance, and did not contain a notice requirement, such that a homeowner could recover merely by presenting evidence that he or she had previously purchased a title insurance policy for the property in question within the preceding ten years then, under the Randlemans' theory of the case, a district court might be within its discretion to certify a class. In that situation, the homeowners could establish their eligibility to participate in the class in a manner similar to the class members in <i>Beattie</i> and <i>Daffin.</i> However, the rate rules require that Fidelity had notice of the prior policy in order to receive the discount. Therefore, under the Randlemans' current theory of the case, presenting a prior policy at this time is not enough to establish that Fidelity wrongfully denied the discount. The only way to resolve these particular claims and establish whether Fidelity improperly refused to give the refinance discount is to consider what Fidelity knew about each individual transaction at the time it issued a policy by examining each individual transaction. Accordingly, we cannot conclude that the district court abused its discretion by concluding that common issues do not predominate and decertifying the class.</p>\n<p>Some district courts in other jurisdictions have certified similar class actions but, in those states, mortgagees appear to regularly require title insurance and it <span class=\"star-pagination\">*355</span> may be reasonable to presume that a prior recorded mortgage constitutes sufficient \"other information\" to warrant giving the reissue discount. For example, recent revisions to the rate manual in Pennsylvania provide that the refinance rate applies if the title search reveals a prior mortgage from an institutional lender or even just a prior deed to a bona fide purchaser for value. <i>Slapikas,</i> 250 F.R.D. at 235-36. Similarly, in Maine, there is some evidence to suggest that most institutional lenders require title insurance. <i>Campbell,</i> 269 F.R.D. at 72-73. In both of those states, because of how mortgages are handled, district courts found that classes could be certified. <i>See generally id.</i> at 80; <i>Slapikas,</i> 250 F.R.D. at 251. However, Fidelity established, and the district courts agreed, that lenders in Ohio do not regularly require title insurance. Therefore, these other district court opinions are not persuasive because they deal with very different factual circumstances. In Ohio, under the Randlemans' theory of the case, each homeowner's entitlement to the discount rate turns on an individual case-by-case analysis, and the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that common issues do not predominate and decertifying the class.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. The Hickmans.</h2>\n<p>Similarly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the Hickmans' motion for class certification. For the same reasons that the Randlemans failed to establish that common issues predominate, the Hickmans also did not establish that common issues predominate with respect to the class they proposed, and the district court's decision to deny class certification was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. Whether the District Court Abused Its Discretion by Not Adopting the Randlemans' Proposed Case Management Plan.</h2>\n<p>The Randlemans argue that any individual issues could be resolved easily through creative case management procedures. They outline a multistep process that, in their view, would have enabled the district court to resolve these claims on a class-wide basis.<sup>[3]</sup> District courts have broad discretion in determining whether to bifurcate proceedings or divide a class action into subclasses. <i>See </i><i>In re Ins. Brokerage Antitrust Litig.,</i> 579 F.3d 241, 271 (3d Cir.2009); <i>Williams v. Mohawk Indus., Inc.,</i> 568 F.3d 1350, 1355 (11th Cir. 2009); <i>see also </i><i>Beattie,</i> 511 F.3d at 559 (noting the district court's discretion to certify a class in light of its inherent power to manage and control litigation). The district court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to adopt the Randlemans' plan because it would not have more easily permitted class-wide resolution of these issues. Essentially, the proposed procedure would have been more discovery to determine which lending institutions require that mortgagors purchase title insurance, followed by a trial on the class-wide issues of liability. However, even this formulationwhich the Randlemans presumably framed in a manner to minimize individual issues and to emphasize those susceptible to class-wide resolutionwould still require substantial, individual inquiries.</p>\n<p>For example, the Randlemans assert that one of the purportedly class-wide issues to resolve at trial under their plan is whether \"information in a particular property's chain of title\" is sufficient \"other information\" to qualify the homeowner for the discount. This is a highly individualized <span class=\"star-pagination\">*356</span> inquiry into each particular property. Because the Randlemans' case management plan still requires resolving numerous individual issues, we find no abuse of discretion in the district court's decision not to adopt it.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Fidelity argues that subclassing and bifurcation cannot be used to overcome a lack of predominance. Some other circuits have adopted this view and held that creative subclassing and bifurcation procedures cannot be used to remedy a lack of predominance. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Sacred Heart Health Sys., Inc. v. Humana Military Healthcare Servs., Inc.,</i> 601 F.3d 1159, 1176 (11th Cir.2010); <i>Castano v. Am. Tobacco Co.,</i> 84 F.3d 734, 745 &amp; n. 20 (5th Cir.1996); <i>see also </i><i>Gunnells v. Healthplan Servs., Inc.,</i> 348 F.3d 417, 446-47 (4th Cir. 2003) (Niemeyer, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). However, other circuits see no such barrier and allow subclassing as long as common issues predominate over the subclasses. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>In re Nassau Cnty. Strip Search Cases,</i> 461 F.3d 219, 226 (2d Cir.2006); <i>Gunnells,</i> 348 F.3d at 439; <i>Valentino v. Carter-Wallace, Inc.,</i> 97 F.3d 1227, 1234 (9th Cir.1996). The Sixth Circuit has not yet weighed in on this issue and we do not at this time because even under the Randlemans' proposed subclassing plan, common issues still do not predominate.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>The relatively small amount of money that each individual plaintiff could possibly recover suggests that a class action is the only real meaningful way to afford relief in this case. While our holding does not extend to a class that might be differently defined to satisfy the requirements in Rule 23, as these claims are presented and classes are defined, resolving each individual homeowner's entitlement to the refinance rate requires a highly individual inquiry. Therefore, the district courts did not abuse their discretion in concluding that the claims presented in these two putative classes are not amenable to class-wide resolution. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district courts' decisions.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Both district courts also held that the putative classes did not meet the commonality or typicality requirements. However, because we hold that the district courts did not abuse their discretion in concluding that the predominance requirement is unsatisfied, we do not address whether the district courts abused their discretion in finding these other requirements unsatisfied.</p>\n<p>[2]  While we cannot redefine the class on appeal, at oral argument, counsel argued for a class like that proposed in the <i>Hickman</i> case, where membership included all those who purchased title insurance for a property that had a prior mortgage within the look-back period.</p>\n<p>[3]  The Hickmans did not propose a case management plan to the district court and, therefore, do not argue that the district court abused its discretion in refusing to adopt one.</p>\n\n</div>",

MARTIN, JR., Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>Jerry and Dianne Randleman appeal the district court's decision to decertify the class in an action that they brought against Fidelity National Title Insurance Company. The Randlemans allege that Fidelity failed to provide a discount, as required by its filed rates, when issuing title insurance to homeowners who had purchased a title insurance policy for the same property from any other insurer within the previous ten years. Dean and Aimee Hickman brought an action alleging the same claims against First American Title Insurance Company, but the district court denied their motion to certify a class. Neither district court abused its discretion in concluding that, as the classes are presently defined, common issues do not predominate. We therefore AFFIRM both orders.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. The Randlemans.</h2>\n<p>When Jerry and Dianne Randleman purchased a home in New London, Ohio in 2001, they also purchased both a lender's title insurance policy and an owner's policy. In 2004 the Randlemans refinanced their home and their new mortgagee required that they purchase a new title insurance policy for its benefit. Fidelity issued the new policy but failed to give the Randlemans the discounted \"refinance\" rate applicable when another insurer has issued a title insurance policy on the property within the previous ten years. The Randlemans assert that Fidelity overcharged them $213.57 by failing to provide the discount.</p>\n<p>Ohio law requires that Fidelity file its rates with the state, which it does through the Ohio Title Insurance Rating Bureau. The Bureau filed a \"Rate Manual\" with Ohio, which is binding on Fidelity, and requires that Fidelity charge a discounted premium rate for policies issued in connection with refinancing transactions. This discount appears to be based on there being less risk to the current underwriter, and less investigation required, because some other entity has recently investigated <span class=\"star-pagination\">*350</span> and insured the title to the property. Provision PR-10 of the Rate Manual states:</p>\n<blockquote>When a refinance loan is made to the same borrower on the same land, the following rate will be charged . . . provided the Insurer is given a copy of the prior policy, or other information sufficient to enable the Insurer to identify such prior policy upon which reissue is requested, and the amount of the unpaid principal balance secured by the original loan:</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<pre>\n  Age of Original Loan  Policy Rates\n  --------------------  -------------\n  10 years or under     70% of original rate\n  Over 10 years         100% of original rate\n</pre>\n<p>Provision PR-9 of the Rate Manual is similarly worded and offers the same thirty percent discount to homeowners who purchased an owner's title insurance policy for the property within the previous ten years.</p>\n<p>Although the Randlemans' prior title insurance purchase made them eligible for this discount, they were unaware it existed. Consequently, the Randlemans never requested the discount or submitted the necessary documentation to establish that they had recently purchased title insurance. After considering all of the requirements for class certification in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23, the district court, pursuant to Rule 23(b)(3), initially certified a class consisting of:</p>\n<blockquote>All persons who (i) paid for title insurance issued by defendant Fidelity National Title Insurance Company in connection with the refinancing of a residential mortgage loan on property located in Ohio that was completed on or after February 15, 2000, (ii) were entitled to receive the \"reissue\" or \"refinance\" rate for title insurance pursuant to Section 8 or Section 9 of the Filed Rates (for transactions prior to February 1, 2002) or PR-9 or PR-10 of the Filed Rates (for transactions February 1, 2002 to the present), and (iii) paid more than the \"reissue\" or \"refinance\" rate for such title insurance.</blockquote>\n<p>Because Fidelity must have received a copy of the prior policy or the file must have contained \"other information sufficient to enable [Fidelity] to identify such prior policy upon which reissue is requested\" in order for the individual to be eligible to receive the discount, the key question as this litigation is currently framed and the class is defined is what each application for title insurance contained. The district court's initial conclusion that this question is common to all class members and predominates over all other issues was based largely on its view that \"a prior mortgage invariably, or nearly so invariably as to make any variation meaningless, meant that a prior policy had issued.\" <i>Randleman v. Fidelity Nat'l Title Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">264</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.R.D.</span> <span class=\"page\">298</span></span>, 303 (N.D.Ohio 2009). However, after the district court certified the class, the parties engaged in rather extensive discovery and deposed representatives from various Ohio lenders about their practices and use of title insurance. Fidelity established that mortgagees can, and apparently often do, rely on opinion letters from attorneys or title guarantees in lieu of purchasing title insurance. This evidence established that the district court's earlier presumption about the ubiquity of title insurance in mortgage transactions was incorrect: a prior mortgage in the chain of title would not have given Fidelity notice that the homeowner had previously purchased title insurance. The district court accordingly reasoned that liability could only be determined on an individual basis by examining each individual homeowner's file. Therefore, the district court concluded that the putative class failed to meet the commonality or typicality requirements necessary to sustain a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*351</span> class action. Additionally, in light of the individual analysis necessary to determine liability, the district court concluded that common issues did not predominate.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. The Hickmans.</h2>\n<p>When Dean and Aimee Hickman purchased a home in Elyria, Ohio in 1999 they also purchased both a lender's title insurance policy and an owner's policy. The Hickmans then refinanced their home in 2001 and again in 2004. The Hickmans purchased a new title insurance policy for each transaction, with First American issuing the 2004 policy. The Hickmans were apparently unaware that they were eligible to receive the refinance discount, and there is no evidence that they requested the discount or submitted documentation to First American establishing that they had previously purchased title insurance. The Hickmans claim that by not providing the discount First American overcharged them $134.40.</p>\n<p>First American, like Fidelity, files its rates through the Ohio Title Insurance Rating Bureau and is subject to provisions PR-9 and PR-10, which provide the \"refinance discount\" of thirty percent when issuing a title insurance policy if some other title insurer has issued a policy for the property in the previous ten years.</p>\n<p>The Hickmans proposed that the district court certify a class of:</p>\n<blockquote>All persons who (i) paid for a lender's policy of title insurance issued by defendant First American Title Insurance Company in connection with the refinancing of a residential mortgage loan on property located in Ohio that was completed on or after February 2, 2000; (ii) where the subject property previously had been mortgaged within the applicable look-back period; and (iii) paid more than the discounted \"reissue\" or \"refinance\" rate for such title insurance.</blockquote>\n<p>Unlike the Randlemans' proposed class, membership in the Hickmans' class does not turn on an individual's \"entitlement\" to receive the discount, but includes all individuals who refinanced a mortgage within the ten-year look-back period.</p>\n<p>The district court considered the requirements in Rule 23 for certifying a class action and concluded that the Hickmans' proposed class failed to meet the commonality or typicality requirements. Additionally, the district court held that even if the commonality requirement of Rule 23(a) were met, common questions did not predominate as required to maintain a class action under Rule 23(b)(3). Thus, the district court denied the motion for class certification.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Standard of Review.</h2>\n<p>This Court reviews a district court's decision to deny class certification for abuse of discretion. <i>Ball v. Union Carbide Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"787980\"><a href=\"/opinion/787980/fannie-ball-02-6289-stephen-heiser-02-6311-v-union-carbide-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">385</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">713</span></a></span>, 727 (6th Cir. 2004). \"The district court maintains substantial discretion in determining whether to certify a class, as it possesses the inherent power to manage and control its own pending litigation.\" <i>Reeb v. Ohio Dep't of Rehab. &amp; Corr.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"793049\"><a href=\"/opinion/793049/rachel-reeb-v-ohio-department-of-rehabilitation-and-correction-belmont/\"><span class=\"volume\">435</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">639</span></a></span>, 643 (6th Cir.2006). \"The district court's decision certifying the class is subject to a very limited review and will be reversed only upon a strong showing that the district court's decision was a clear abuse of discretion.\" <i>Beattie v. CenturyTel, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1194565\"><a href=\"/opinion/1194565/beattie-v-centurytel-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">554</span></a></span>, 559-60 (6th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \"A district court abuses its discretion when [it] relies on erroneous findings of fact, applies the wrong legal standard, misapplies the correct legal standard when reaching a conclusion, or makes a clear error of judgment.\" <i>Id.</i> at 560 (alteration <span class=\"star-pagination\">*352</span> in original) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p>Although this Court has not previously addressed the standard of review applicable to orders decertifying classes, other circuits use the same, highly deferential, abuse-of-discretion review applied to certification orders. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Voss v. Rolland,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">592</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">242</span></span>, 245-46 (1st Cir.2010); <i>Pierce v.

Applying this same standard of review is also consistent with the district court's continuing obligation to ensure that the class certification requirements are met, and with the district court's ability to alter or amend the certification order as circumstances change and the parties' litigation strategies evolve. <i>See </i><i>Barney v. Holzer Clinic, Ltd.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"739320\"><a href=\"/opinion/739320/teresa-barney-and-randy-barney-bonita-waldron-on-behalf-of-themselves-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1207</span></a></span>, 1214 (6th Cir.1997); <i>see also</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(c)(1)(C). Therefore, we will also review the order decertifying the class action in <i>Randleman</i> for abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Whether the District Courts Abused Their Discretion by Concluding that Common Issues Do Not Predominate.</h2>\n<p>In light of the relatively small sums of money involved in each individual transaction, a class action appears to be the only way in which homeowners who were improperly denied the discount on title insurance may be able to recover. However, under the plaintiffs' theory of liability and proposed class definitions, neither district court abused its discretion by concluding that common issues do not predominate and refusing to allow class-wide litigation to proceed.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. The Randlemans.</h2>\n<p>The class the district court initially certified was flawed in that it only included those who are \"entitled to relief.\" This is an improper fail-safe class that shields the putative class members from receiving an adverse judgment. Either the class members win or, by virtue of losing, they are not in the class and, therefore, not bound by the judgment.<sup>[2]</sup><i>See </i><i>Genenbacher v. CenturyTel Fiber Co. II, LLC,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">244</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.R.D.</span> <span class=\"page\">485</span></span>, 488 (C.D.Ill.2007); <i>see also Campbell v. First Am. Title Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">269</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.R.D.</span> <span class=\"page\">68</span></span>, 73-74 (D.Me.2010) (revising the class definition to avoid \"the `fail safe' issue\"); <i>Slapikas v. First Am. Title Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">250</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.R.D.</span> <span class=\"page\">232</span></span>, 250-51 (W.D.Pa.2008) (same). Although this is an independent ground for denying class certification, the district court also did not abuse its discretion in decertifying the Randlemans' class based on its conclusion that common issues do not predominate.</p>\n<p>In addition to the numerosity, commonality, typicality and adequacy prerequisites necessary for all class actions, Fed. R.Civ.P. 23(a), in order to bring a damages class action under Rule 23(b)(3) the court must find that common questions predominate and that a class action is a superior way to resolve the controversy, Fed. R.Civ.P. 23(b)(3). To meet the predominance <span class=\"star-pagination\">*353</span> requirement, a plaintiff must establish that issues subject to generalized proof and applicable to the class as a whole predominate over those issues that are subject to only individualized proof. <i>Beattie,</i> 511 F.3d at 564.</p>\n<p>The district court initially certified the class assuming that Fidelity would have discovered a prior mortgage in the process of issuing title insurance, and a prior mortgage necessarily means that the applicant purchased title insurance in connection with that prior mortgage. <i>Randleman,</i> 264 F.R.D. at 304. If this presumption held up, it may have been possible to maintain a class action with the common issue being whether a prior mortgage is sufficient \"other information\" to qualify for the discount. However, after Fidelity established through discovery that title insurance is not necessarilyor even usuallypurchased in connection with mortgages in Ohio, the district court concluded that common issues do not predominate. <i>Id.</i> Consistent with this revelation, district courts in Ohio considering similar class actions brought against other title insurers have all concluded that common issues do not predominate and have either denied class certification or decertified classes. <i>See Hickman v. First Am. Title Ins. Co.,</i> No. 07-cv-1543, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2010</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">3075157</span></span>, at *5 (N.D.Ohio Aug.5, 2010); <i>Chesner v. Stewart Title Guar. Co.,</i> No. 06-cv-476, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2009</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">585823</span></span>, at *8 (N.D.Ohio Jan.9, 2009); <i>Macula v. Lawyers Title Ins. Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">264</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.R.D.</span> <span class=\"page\">307</span></span>, 311 (N.D.Ohio 2009).</p>\n<p>In light of how the Randlemans have framed the issues and defined the class, without the initial presumption, determining liability would require an examination of each individual policy Fidelity issued to determine if Fidelity had received a copy of the prior policy or \"other information\" suggesting that a policy had previously been issued. Under this framework, establishing that Fidelity received this information is essential to proving liability and, as the district court found, a highly individual inquiry. Similarly, in a lawsuit alleging nearly identical claims against a title insurer in Texas, the Fifth Circuit recently recognized that determining an individual's eligibility to receive the refinance discount is highly individual and affirmed a district court's decision denying class certification based on a failure to meet the predominance requirement. <i>See </i><i>Benavides v. Chicago Title Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"213419\"><a href=\"/opinion/213419/benavides-v-chicago-title-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">636</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">699</span></a></span>, 701-03 (5th Cir.2011). Therefore, because the Randlemans have defined the class and presented their claim in a manner that requires substantial, individual inquiries, the district court's decision decertifying the class was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p>While the need to prove damages or establish class membership on an individual basis is not fatal to class certification, liability is a central issue in this matter and the Randlemans' claims can only be determined on an individual basis. In <i>Beattie,</i> for example, this Court affirmed a district court's order certifying a class under Rule 23(b)(3) alleging that the defendant violated federal and state law by engaging in deceptive billing practices. 511 F.3d at 559, 568. The central issue in <i>Beattie</i> was whether the defendant's billing practices were deceptive, which was common to all subscribers. <i>Id.</i> at 565-66. Although each plaintiff would need to show damages individually, we held that the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the class-wide issue of whether the defendant's billing was deceptive predominated over individual issues. <i>Id.</i> at 566.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the need to prove entitlement to participate in the class on an individual basis will also not necessarily mean that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*354</span> common issues do not predominate. In <i>Daffin v. Ford Motor Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"795284\"><a href=\"/opinion/795284/patricia-a-daffin-on-behalf-of-herself-and-all-others-similarly-situated/\"><span class=\"volume\">458</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">549</span></a></span>, 550-51 (6th Cir.2006), this Court affirmed a district court's order certifying a class alleging breach of an express warranty based on allegedly defective throttle body assemblies in certain Mercury Villager minivans. The district court concluded that the common questions of whether the throttle body was defective, whether the defect reduces the value of the car, and whether the defect is covered by the express warranty predominated over any individual issues. <i>Id.</i> at 554. Although each individual would, after the common issues were litigated, need to establish that he or she owned the relevant vehicle during the relevant time period, we affirmed the district court's conclusion that common issues predominated. <i>Id.</i> Importantly, both the district court's opinion and our holding were premised on a notion that individuals who owned the car were injured even if they had not personally experienced a stuck throttle body. <i>Id.</i> at 552-54. And, we noted that the district court may need to reconsider whether a class can be maintained if it turned out that only individuals who actually had a stuck throttle body during the warranty period were entitled to recover. <i>Id.</i> at 554.</p>\n<p>The Randlemans attempt to fit their claim within <i>Beattie</i> and <i>Daffin,</i> but the requirements in the Ohio rate rules necessitate substantial, individual inquiries to determine liability under their theory of the case and class definition that are incompatible with the predominance requirement of Rule 23(b)(3). Unlike these claims, liability in <i>Beattie</i> could be determined on a class-wide basis: if the billing practices were deceptive, they would be deceptive for all class members. <i>Id.</i> at 564; <i>accord </i><i>Hohinder v. United Parcel Serv., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1359556\"><a href=\"/opinion/1359556/hohider-v-united-parcel-service-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">574</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">169</span></a></span>, 184-85 (3d Cir. 2009) (recognizing that the existence of discriminatory policies could be proven on a class-wide basis, but reversing order certifying a class action because class-wide liability required individual inquiries incompatible with the requirements in Rule 23). Unlike these claims, in <i>Daffin</i> liability could be determined on a class-wide basis and a class member could establish his or her entitlement to participate in the litigation merely by submitting proof that he or she owned the car during the time period. If the rate rules provided the discount to anyone who previously purchased title insurance, and did not contain a notice requirement, such that a homeowner could recover merely by presenting evidence that he or she had previously purchased a title insurance policy for the property in question within the preceding ten years then, under the Randlemans' theory of the case, a district court might be within its discretion to certify a class. In that situation, the homeowners could establish their eligibility to participate in the class in a manner similar to the class members in <i>Beattie</i> and <i>Daffin.</i> However, the rate rules require that Fidelity had notice of the prior policy in order to receive the discount. Therefore, under the Randlemans' current theory of the case, presenting a prior policy at this time is not enough to establish that Fidelity wrongfully denied the discount. The only way to resolve these particular claims and establish whether Fidelity improperly refused to give the refinance discount is to consider what Fidelity knew about each individual transaction at the time it issued a policy by examining each individual transaction. Accordingly, we cannot conclude that the district court abused its discretion by concluding that common issues do not predominate and decertifying the class.</p>\n<p>Some district courts in other jurisdictions have certified similar class actions but, in those states, mortgagees appear to regularly require title insurance and it <span class=\"star-pagination\">*355</span> may be reasonable to presume that a prior recorded mortgage constitutes sufficient \"other information\" to warrant giving the reissue discount. For example, recent revisions to the rate manual in Pennsylvania provide that the refinance rate applies if the title search reveals a prior mortgage from an institutional lender or even just a prior deed to a bona fide purchaser for value. <i>Slapikas,</i> 250 F.R.D. at 235-36. Similarly, in Maine, there is some evidence to suggest that most institutional lenders require title insurance. <i>Campbell,</i> 269 F.R.D. at 72-73. In both of those states, because of how mortgages are handled, district courts found that classes could be certified. <i>See generally id.</i> at 80; <i>Slapikas,</i> 250 F.R.D. at 251. However, Fidelity established, and the district courts agreed, that lenders in Ohio do not regularly require title insurance. Therefore, these other district court opinions are not persuasive because they deal with very different factual circumstances. In Ohio, under the Randlemans' theory of the case, each homeowner's entitlement to the discount rate turns on an individual case-by-case analysis, and the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that common issues do not predominate and decertifying the class.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. The Hickmans.</h2>\n<p>Similarly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the Hickmans' motion for class certification. For the same reasons that the Randlemans failed to establish that common issues predominate, the Hickmans also did not establish that common issues predominate with respect to the class they proposed, and the district court's decision to deny class certification was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. Whether the District Court Abused Its Discretion by Not Adopting the Randlemans' Proposed Case Management Plan.</h2>\n<p>The Randlemans argue that any individual issues could be resolved easily through creative case management procedures. They outline a multistep process that, in their view, would have enabled the district court to resolve these claims on a class-wide basis.<sup>[3]</sup> District courts have broad discretion in determining whether to bifurcate proceedings or divide a class action into subclasses. <i>See </i><i>In re Ins. Brokerage Antitrust Litig.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1357701\"><a href=\"/opinion/1357701/in-re-ins-brokerage-antitrust-litigation/\"><span class=\"volume\">579</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">241</span></a></span>, 271 (3d Cir.2009); <i>Williams v. Mohawk Indus., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"78353\"><a href=\"/opinion/78353/williams-v-mohawk-industries-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">568</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1350</span></a></span>, 1355 (11th Cir. 2009); <i>see also </i><i>Beattie,</i> 511 F.3d at 559 (noting the district court's discretion to certify a class in light of its inherent power to manage and control litigation). The district court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to adopt the Randlemans' plan because it would not have more easily permitted class-wide resolution of these issues. Essentially, the proposed procedure would have been more discovery to determine which lending institutions require that mortgagors purchase title insurance, followed by a trial on the class-wide issues of liability. However, even this formulationwhich the Randlemans presumably framed in a manner to minimize individual issues and to emphasize those susceptible to class-wide resolutionwould still require substantial, individual inquiries.</p>\n<p>For example, the Randlemans assert that one of the purportedly class-wide issues to resolve at trial under their plan is whether \"information in a particular property's chain of title\" is sufficient \"other information\" to qualify the homeowner for the discount. This is a highly individualized <span class=\"star-pagination\">*356</span> inquiry into each particular property. Because the Randlemans' case management plan still requires resolving numerous individual issues, we find no abuse of discretion in the district court's decision not to adopt it.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Fidelity argues that subclassing and bifurcation cannot be used to overcome a lack of predominance. Some other circuits have adopted this view and held that creative subclassing and bifurcation procedures cannot be used to remedy a lack of predominance. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Sacred Heart Health Sys., Inc. v. Humana Military Healthcare Servs., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1119\"><a href=\"/opinion/1119/sacred-heart-health-v-humana-military-healthcare/\"><span class=\"volume\">601</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1159</span></a></span>, 1176 (11th Cir.2010); <i>Castano v. Am. Tobacco Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"718631\"><a href=\"/opinion/718631/dianne-castano-v-the-american-tobacco-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">84</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">734</span></a></span>, 745 &amp; n. 20 (5th Cir.1996); <i>see also </i><i>Gunnells v. Healthplan Servs., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">348</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">417</span></span>, 446-47 (4th Cir. 2003) (Niemeyer, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). However, other circuits see no such barrier and allow subclassing as long as common issues predominate over the subclasses. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>In re Nassau Cnty. Strip Search Cases,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"795507\"><a href=\"/opinion/795507/in-re-nassau-county-strip-search-cases-gardy-augustin-heidi-kane-mary/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">219</span></a></span>, 226 (2d Cir.2006); <i>Gunnells,</i> 348 F.3d at 439; <i>Valentino v. Carter-Wallace, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"727387\"><a href=\"/opinion/727387/monica-valentino-michael-a-hackard-hugo-s-jennings-wanda-s-oconnor/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1227</span></a></span>, 1234 (9th Cir.1996). The Sixth Circuit has not yet weighed in on this issue and we do not at this time because even under the Randlemans' proposed subclassing plan, common issues still do not predominate.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>The relatively small amount of money that each individual plaintiff could possibly recover suggests that a class action is the only real meaningful way to afford relief in this case. While our holding does not extend to a class that might be differently defined to satisfy the requirements in Rule 23, as these claims are presented and classes are defined, resolving each individual homeowner's entitlement to the refinance rate requires a highly individual inquiry. Therefore, the district courts did not abuse their discretion in concluding that the claims presented in these two putative classes are not amenable to class-wide resolution. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district courts' decisions.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Both district courts also held that the putative classes did not meet the commonality or typicality requirements. However, because we hold that the district courts did not abuse their discretion in concluding that the predominance requirement is unsatisfied, we do not address whether the district courts abused their discretion in finding these other requirements unsatisfied.</p>\n<p>[2]  While we cannot redefine the class on appeal, at oral argument, counsel argued for a class like that proposed in the <i>Hickman</i> case, where membership included all those who purchased title insurance for a property that had a prior mortgage within the look-back period.</p>\n<p>[3]  The Hickmans did not propose a case management plan to the district court and, therefore, do not argue that the district court abused its discretion in refusing to adopt one.</p>\n\n</div>",
