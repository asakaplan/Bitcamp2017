Each summer, Plaintiff George\nSaieg attends the Arab International Festival (“Festival”) in the City of Dearborn,\nMichigan (“City”). At the Festival, Saieg leads a group of Christians whose goal is to\nconvert Muslims to Christianity. In 2009, Dearborn police instituted a leafleting\n\n\n                                          1\n\fNo. 10-1746             Saieg v. City of Dearborn, et al.                                            Page 2\n\n\nrestriction for the Festival. Pursuant to the restriction, no one may leaflet from the\nsidewalks that are directly adjacent to the Festival attractions, or on the sidewalks and\nroads that surround the Festival’s core on each side by one to five city blocks. The\nrestriction permits leafleting at the Festival only from a stationary booth and not while\nwalking around the Festival.\n\n         Saieg sued the City of Dearborn and its Chief of Police, alleging that the\nleafleting restriction violated his First Amendment right to free speech, as well as his\nfreedom to associate, his free exercise of religion, and his right to equal protection. The\ndistrict court denied a temporary restraining order before the 2009 Festival and granted\nsummary judgment to the defendants in 2010. This court granted Saieg an injunction\npending appeal for the 2010 Festival, permitting Saieg to distribute leaflets from the\nouter sidewalks and roads, but not on the sidewalks that are directly adjacent to the\nFestival attractions.\n\n         On the free speech claim, we REVERSE the district court’s grant of summary\njudgment to the defendants and its denial of summary judgment to the plaintiffs. We\nthereby invalidate the leafleting restriction within both the inner and outer perimeters of\nthe Festival.1 The restriction on the sidewalks that are directly adjacent to the Festival\nattractions does not serve a substantial government interest. The City keeps those same\nsidewalks open for public traffic and permits sidewalk vendors, whose activity is more\nobstructive to sidewalk traffic flow than pedestrian leafleting is. Moreover, the\nprohibition of pedestrian leafleting in the outer perimeter is not narrowly tailored to the\ngoal of isolating inner areas from vehicular traffic. The City can be held liable because\nthe Chief of Police, who instituted the leafleting restriction, created official municipal\npolicy. We AFFIRM the district court’s judgment for the defendants on all other\nclaims. We REMAND to the district court for such further proceedings as are consistent\nwith this opinion that may be warranted.\n\n\n\n         1\n           Saieg has not requested the ability to leaflet on the street that contains Festival attractions. As\na result, we do not pass judgment on whether a ban on leafleting on that street itself is constitutionally\npermissible.\n\fNo. 10-1746        Saieg v. City of Dearborn, et al.                               Page 3\n\n\n                                 I. BACKGROUND\n\nA. Substantive Facts\n\n       1. The Arab International Festival\n\n       The American Arab Chamber of Commerce (“AACC”) organizes the Festival,\nwhich is free and open to the public. Each year, over 250,000 people attend the Festival,\nwhich features carnival rides, a main stage with live entertainment, international food,\nmerchandise sales, a tent targeted at children, and tents in which artisans and other\nvendors display products. In 2009, forty artisan vendors, twenty-five information tables,\nfourteen food vendors, and seventeen sponsor booths took part in the Festival. These\nattractions are all located within the “inner perimeter” of the Festival: the eight blocks\nof Warren Avenue between Hartwell Street to the west and Kingsley Street to the east,\nas well as one block south on Miller Road, which intersects Warren Avenue. Due to the\nscale of the event, officers from the Dearborn Police Department supply extensive\nsecurity and support the Festival from a “[c]ommand post trailer.” R. 47-11 (Ex. K:\nHaddad dep. at 52). The resolution authorizing the Festival “subject[s]” the Festival to\n“the rules and regulations of the Police Department.” R. 47-13 (Ex. M: Council\nResolution)\n\n       Businesses located along the inner perimeter on Warren Avenue can obtain\npermits to display and sell their goods on the sidewalks outside their storefronts.\nAlthough the City itself issued the sidewalk permits prior to 2009, the City now\ndelegates authority to issue the permits to the AACC. Businesses and organizations not\nlocated on Warren Avenue can purchase an information table. In fact, if businesses or\norganizations wish to distribute materials, the City’s police department requires that the\ndistribution occur from a “fixed location,” which in practice means an information table\nlocated in the street, not on the sidewalk. R. 47-8 (Ex. H: Mrowka dep. at 32).\n“[H]andbilling along the sidewalks that are adjacent to the [F]estival” is not permitted.\nR. 47-3 (Ex. C: Beydoun dep. 35). Police officers are expected to warn anyone who\ndistributes leaflets and, if the person continues, to arrest the offender. Dearborn Chief\n\fNo. 10-1746         Saieg v. City of Dearborn, et al.                                  Page 4\n\n\nof Police Ronald Haddad, who assumed his position shortly before the 2009 Festival and\nhas prior experience with crowd control in other capacities, testified that a similar policy\nis in place at the Michigan State Fair. The Michigan State Fair “will not allow you to\ngive out a paper clip unless you’re stationary and at a booth. It just makes good sense,\nit’s a good practice[,] and it’s not a standard that is applied indiscriminately[;] it’s across\nthe board.” R. 47-11 (Ex. K: Haddad Dep. at 95). Fay Beydoun, Executive Director of\nthe AACC, testified that the leafleting policy exists “to make sure that the sidewalks\n[a]re available, whether it’s for the people attending the [F]estival or people [who a]re\ntrying to get from one location to another to go to the businesses” along Warren Avenue.\nR. 47-3 (Ex. C: Beydoun Dep. at 37); see also R. 47-11 (Ex. K: Haddad Dep. at 18)\n(“[K]nowing that it [i]s going to be a very crowded situation, we . . . do our very best to\nkeep the sidewalks flowing.”).\n\n        To accommodate Festival traffic, the City barricades the roads within an “outer\nperimeter” or “buffer zone” that surrounds the inner perimeter. Although the outer\nperimeter does not contain attractions, it services the Festival by “restrict[ing] traffic,”\nR. 47-8 (Ex. H: Mrowka Dep. at 15), and “giv[ing] [vehicular] traffic some final point\nto turn away from the Warren Avenue destination,” R. 47-11 (Ex. K: Haddad Dep. at\n26–27). The outer perimeter also enhances “crowd control [leading] into the [F]estival\narea.” R. 47-8 (Ex. H: Mrowka Dep. at 15). Finally, the outer perimeter includes\nparking for Festival attendees and vendors, as well as for displaced employees of Warren\nAvenue businesses and any of those businesses’ patrons who are not attending the\nFestival. R. 47-3 (Ex. C: Beydoun Dep. at 43–44). The outer perimeter stretches one\nblock north of Warren Avenue (Morrow Circle), one block south of Warren Avenue\n(Blesser Avenue), five blocks west of Hartwell Street (Schaefer Road), and four blocks\neast of Kingsley Street (Wyoming Avenue).\n\n        The restriction on leafleting applies in the outer perimeter area as well. Beydoun\nexplained why: “if you allowed someone to distribute literature within [the] outer area,\nyou might as well allow the other street vendors to set up tables and start selling things\n\fNo. 10-1746        Saieg v. City of Dearborn, et al.                              Page 5\n\n\nin that area, too. That is the buffer between going in and going out. You [have] to\nmaintain a security area.” R. 47-3 (Ex. C: Beydoun Dep. at 58).\n\n       2. Saieg and the Arabic Christian Perspective\n\n       Saieg founded the Arabic Christian Perspective (“ACP”), a now-defunct\n“national ministry established for the purpose of proclaiming the Holy Gospel of Jesus\nChrist to Muslims. As part of its outreach efforts, ACP travel[ed] around the country\nattending and distributing Christian literature at festivals and mosques.”        R. 13\n(Amended Compl. ¶ 9). Because the City is home to a “big Muslim community,” the\nFestival provides Saieg the opportunity to evangelize “thousands of Muslims in one\nplace.” R. 48 (Ex. A: Saieg Dep. at 42, 44). Before each Festival, the ACP operated\nan annual event called “Facing the Muslim Challenge.” In 2009, the program featured\npanel discussions, workshops on “[e]ffectively witnessing to Muslims,” debates, door-to-\ndoor outreach, and mosque tours. R. 47–2 (Ex. B: Program). The program culminated\nin outreach at the Festival. At each Festival from 2004 to 2008, Saieg and 90 to 120\nACP members distributed leaflets from the public sidewalks that abut Warren Avenue.\n\n       In 2009, Saieg had planned for 90 ACP members to continue the practice of\nleafleting while roaming the Festival. However, when Saieg shared these plans with a\nCity police sergeant, Saieg learned that the new Chief of Police, Chief Haddad, would\nnot permit anyone to distribute leaflets while walking around the Festival. Instead, the\nCity provided the ACP with a booth, waiving the standard fee. The booth was poorly\nlit and located by carnival rides, which attracted mostly children. This problem was\nremedied in 2010, when the ACP’s booth was lit and located “in the central area.” Saieg\nv. City of Dearborn, 720 F. Supp. 2d 817, 834–35 (E.D. Mich. 2010) (describing then-\nupcoming plans for the 2010 festival). Saieg also faces a more basic problem with\nbooth-based evangelism: “[t]he penalty of leaving Islam according to Islamic books is\ndeath,” which makes Muslims reluctant to approach a booth that is publicly “labeled as\n. . . Christian.” R. 48 (Ex. A: Saieg Dep. at 75). Saieg believes that evangelism is more\neffective when he can roam the Festival and speak to Muslims more discreetly. The\nACP distributed 37,000 packets of religious materials in 2007 and 20,000 packets in\n\fNo. 10-1746         Saieg v. City of Dearborn, et al.                                 Page 6\n\n\n2008, but only 500 packets in 2009 due to the remote, fixed location. Numbers from\n2010 are not in the record.\n\nB. Procedural History\n\n        On June 16, 2009, Saieg and ACP sued the City and Chief Haddad for violating\ntheir First Amendment rights to free speech, free association, and free exercise of\nreligion, in addition to violating the Equal Protection Clause. Saieg has specified that\n“this is not a facial challenge” to the leafleting restriction but “an as-applied challenge.”\nAppellant Br. at 38. Moreover, Saieg has “at no time . . . requested to engage in his\nreligious activity on Warren Avenue or Miller Road,” although he has asked to leaflet\non the sidewalks that are adjacent to those roads. Id. at 2. The plaintiffs sought\ndeclaratory and injunctive relief, attorney fees and costs, and nominal damages. Two\ndays after the plaintiffs filed their complaint, the district court denied a temporary\nrestraining order. At the 2009 Festival, the plaintiffs distributed leaflets from the\ninconveniently located booth.\n\n        The ACP was dismissed from the case after the organization dissolved. On\nJune 7, 2010, the district court denied Saieg’s motion for summary judgment and granted\nsummary judgment to the defendants. The district court held that the leafleting\nrestriction was a valid time, place, and manner restriction, relying heavily on Heffron v.\nInternational Society for Krishna Consciousness, 452 U.S. 640 (1981), and the Sixth\nCircuit’s application of Heffron in Spingola v. Village of Granville, 39 F. App’x 978 (6th\nCir. 2002) (unpublished opinion). The district court reasoned that Saieg retains\nalternative channels of communication, even though they are not his preferred channels,\nbecause he could “orally propagat[e] [his] religious views,” distribute materials from a\nbooth, and distribute materials outside of the Festival. Saieg, 720 F. Supp. 2d at 834–35.\nThe leafleting restriction is content neutral, said the district court, because permitting\nWarren Avenue businesses to have sidewalk sales “favor[s], if anyone, those with space\nalong Warren Avenue no matter who they are or what their message” is. Id. at 837. The\nleafleting restriction serves a substantial government interest “in ensuring the orderly\nflow of pedestrian traffic through the crowded Festival.” Id. at 838. Finally, the district\n\fNo. 10-1746         Saieg v. City of Dearborn, et al.                                  Page 7\n\n\ncourt found that the restriction is narrowly tailored because allowing everyone to\ndistribute leaflets in the outer perimeter area would “effectively extend the Festival\ngrounds into an area that is meant to serve as a buffer zone between the Festival and the\noutside world.” Id. at 840. Even though streets and sidewalks are traditionally public\nfora, “[f]or three days out of the year, the streets and sidewalks of the outer perimeter . . .\nare serving an entirely different role.” Id. The district court found that Saieg had\nabandoned his free exercise claim, and also disposed of the freedom of association and\nequal protection claims. Finally, the district court found that the City was not liable\nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983 because there was no constitutional violation. The four\ninstances of selective enforcement that Saieg highlighted were “insufficient to show that\nselective enforcement . . . was so widespread as to have the force of law,” and Saieg had\nnot shown that the selective enforcement stemmed from official policy. Id. at 844\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n        Saieg appealed to the Sixth Circuit and filed an emergency motion for expedited\nreview. On June 17, 2010, this court ruled that Saieg was likely to succeed on the merits\nof his claim because, although Heffron and Spignola “may support the restriction of\nleaflet distribution among the crowds within the core area of the Festival, they do not\nappear to preclude similar activity in the ‘outer perimeter’ or ‘buffer zone’ leading up\nto the core area.” Sixth Circuit 06/17/10 Order at 3. The panel therefore granted Saieg’s\nmotion for an injunction pending appeal, permitting Saieg “to distribute his religious\nliterature in the streets contained within . . . the ‘outer perimeter’ or ‘buffer zone,’” but\nnot “within the Festival itself.” Id. That order expired after the 2010 Festival. Id. The\n16th annual Festival will be held June 17–19, 2011. Arab International Festival,\nwww.americanarab.com/events-a-programs/business-development.html.\n\fNo. 10-1746         Saieg v. City of Dearborn, et al.                                 Page 8\n\n\n                                    II. DISCUSSION\n\nA. Standard of Review\n\n        When a district court denies a permanent injunction, we review the court’s legal\nconclusions de novo, its factual findings for clear error, and the scope of the injunction\nfor abuse of discretion. Worldwide Basketball & Sport Tours, Inc. v. NCAA, 388 F.3d\n955, 958 (6th Cir. 2004), cert. denied, 546 U.S. 813 (2005). “A party is entitled to a\npermanent injunction if it can establish that it suffered a constitutional violation and will\nsuffer continuing irreparable injury for which there is no adequate remedy at law.”\nWedgewood Ltd. P’ship I v. Twp. of Liberty, 610 F.3d 340, 349 (6th Cir. 2010) (internal\nquotation marks omitted), cert. denied, 131 S. Ct. 1007 (2011).\n\n        The district court granted the defendants summary judgment on the first\npoint—whether Saieg suffered a constitutional violation. That is a legal question, so the\nstandard of review coincides with the de novo standard that we apply to summary\njudgments generally. Id. “The court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows\nthat there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to\njudgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). “We review cross motions for\nsummary judgment under this standard as well, evaluating each motion on its own\nmerits.” La Quinta Corp. v. Heartland Props. LLC, 603 F.3d 327, 335 (6th Cir. 2010).\n\nB. Free Speech\n\n        Following the Supreme Court’s guidance in Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense\n& Educational Fund, Inc., 473 U.S. 788, 797 (1985), we analyze free speech claims in\nthree steps. Parks v. City of Columbus, 395 F.3d 643, 647 (6th Cir. 2005). The first step\nis to determine whether the plaintiff’s conduct is protected speech. Id. Saieg’s conduct\nis clearly protected. “‘[T]he hand distribution of religious tracts is an age-old form of\nmissionary evangelism,’ Murdock v. Pennsylvania, 319 U.S. 105, 108 (1943), and such\nactivity ‘has the same claim as [oral and written dissemination] to the guarantee[] of\nfreedom of speech . . . ,’ id. at 109.” Parks, 395 F.3d at 647.\n\fNo. 10-1746            Saieg v. City of Dearborn, et al.                                           Page 9\n\n\n         The second step is to “‘identify the nature of the forum, because the extent to\nwhich the Government may limit access depends on whether the forum is public or\nnonpublic.’” Id. (quoting Cornelius, 473 U.S. at 797). Public streets and sidewalks “are\n‘quintessential’ public forums for free speech,” Hill v. Colorado, 530 U.S. 703, 715\n(2000); see also Frisby v. Schultz, 487 U.S. 474, 480–81 (1988), although “there have\nbeen limited circumstances where public streets or sidewalks are not considered public\nfora,” Parks, 395 F.3d at 648 (mentioning sidewalks by post offices and sidewalks in\nmilitary reservations). Restrictions on speech in traditional public fora must either be\n(1) reasonable time, place, and manner regulations or (2) “narrowly drawn to accomplish\na compelling governmental interest.” United States v. Grace, 461 U.S. 171, 177 (1983).\nIn general, then, “the government’s ability to permissibly restrict expressive conduct”\non public streets and sidewalks “is very limited.” Id.\n\n         The parties disagree about whether the streets and sidewalks within the inner and\nouter perimeters were functioning as traditional public fora or limited public fora2 during\nthe Festival. Compare Parks, 395 F.3d at 652 (holding that “the streets remained a\ntraditional public forum notwithstanding the special[, non-exclusive] permit” that\nallowed a private group to operate a public Arts Festival on public streets), with\nSpingola, 39 F. App’x at 983 (holding that the “public streets” were “not serving in\nth[eir traditional] function during the festival”); see also Heffron, 452 U.S. at 651\n(explaining that the Minnesota Fair, which is “a temporary event attracting great\nnumbers of visitors,” presents problems of traffic flow and crowd control that make “any\ncomparisons to public streets . . . necessarily inexact”). This disagreement, however, is\nnot germane to the free speech issue in this case. If a rule is “content-neutral, [then] the\nappropriate test is intermediate scrutiny,” even when the rule governs speech in a\ntraditional public forum. Phelps-Roper v. Strickland, 539 F.3d 356, 361–62 (6th Cir.\n2008); see also Spingola, 39 F. App’x at 983 (“[R]egardless of whether we would\nclassify the . . . festival area as a traditional public forum or a limited public forum . . . ,\n\n         2\n           “The government may restrict speech in a limited public forum as long as the restrictions do ‘not\ndiscriminate against speech on the basis of viewpoint’ and are ‘reasonable in light of the purpose served\nby the forum.’” Miller v. City of Cincinnati, 622 F.3d 524, 535 (6th Cir. 2010) (quoting Good News Club\nv. Milford Central Sch., 533 U.S. 98, 106–07 (2001)).\n\fNo. 10-1746         Saieg v. City of Dearborn, et al.                               Page 10\n\n\nthe Ordinance is examined under the same intermediate level of scrutiny.”). As\nexplained below, the leafleting restriction is content neutral.\n\n        Therefore, it is the third step that decides this case: “whether the justifications\nfor exclusion from the relevant forum satisfy the requisite standard.” Cornelius, 473\nU.S. at 797. The requisite principle applicable to this case is that “[t]ime, place, and\nmanner restrictions may be enforced even in a traditional public forum so long as they\nare content neutral, are narrowly tailored to serve a significant government interest, and\nleave open ample alternative channels of communication.” M.A.L. ex rel. M.L. v.\nKinsland, 543 F.3d 841, 850 (6th Cir. 2008). The leafleting restriction does not satisfy\nthis standard.\n\n        1. Content Neutrality\n\n        The leafleting restriction is content neutral. Whether a restriction on speech is\ncontent neutral has substantial bearing on the constitutionality of the restriction because\n“the government is held to a very exacting and rarely satisfied standard when it disfavors\nthe discussion of particular subjects or particular viewpoints within a given subject\nmatter.” Hill, 530 U.S. at 735 (Souter, J., concurring) (internal citations omitted).\nGovernment regulations of speech are content neutral if they are “justified without\nreference to the content or viewpoint of the regulated speech.” Christian Legal Soc’y\nChapter of the Univ. of Cal., Hastings Coll. of the Law v. Martinez, --- U.S. ---, 130\nS. Ct. 2971, 2994 (2010) (internal alterations and quotation marks omitted); see also\nHill, 530 U.S. at 719 (“‘The principal inquiry . . . is whether the government has adopted\na regulation of speech because of disagreement with the message it conveys.’” (quoting\nWard v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U.S. 781, 791 (1989))). “The government’s purpose\nis the controlling consideration.” Ward, 491 U.S. at 791. “[D]ifferential impact”\nwithout more does not demonstrate that a regulation is content based. Christian Legal\nSoc’y, 130 S. Ct. at 2994.\n\n        Requiring that all literature be distributed from a stationary location is a content-\nneutral regulation. Designating “specific areas for specific things” at the Festival, R. 47-\n3 (Ex. C: Beydoun dep. at 33), “is not a ‘regulation of speech.’ Rather, it is a regulation\n\fNo. 10-1746          Saieg v. City of Dearborn, et al.                              Page 11\n\n\nof the places where some speech may occur.” Hill, 530 U.S. at 719. Supporting this\nconclusion is the fact that “the State’s interests” in crowd control and public safety “are\nunrelated to the content of [the regulated] speech.” Id. at 719–20. In addition, Saieg has\nnot produced evidence that the regulation was “adopted ‘because of disagreement with\nthe message [that his speech] conveys.’” Id. at 719 (quoting Ward, 491 U.S. at 791).\n\n          Saieg argues that the leafleting restriction is content based because it privileges\ncommercial speech over noncommercial speech. He points to the City’s practice of\nletting Warren Avenue storefronts erect sidewalk tables, whereas he cannot distribute\nmaterials from the same sidewalk. This argument misapprehends the criterion for who\ncan vend from the sidewalk. The criterion is location, not content or type (commercial\nor noncommercial) of speech. Any entity with a storefront on Warren Avenue can set\nup sidewalk table, and no one without a storefront can become a sidewalk vendor. R.\n47-3 (Ex. C: Beydoun Dep. at 64–65). The defendants do not inquire into whether the\nsidewalk vendor is commercial or noncommercial, and the defendants do not screen the\nmessages that sidewalk tables convey for content.\n\n          The AACC’s proposal for the 2009 Festival confirms that location of the\nspeakers, not the content of their speech, is the criterion for permitting sidewalk sales.\nThe AACC describes “sidewalk sales . . . by merchants on Warren Ave[nue]” as a\ncomponent of the Festival, alongside the “main stage, children’s tent, vendor tents,\nartisan’s tents,” “carnival,” and “[f]ood and entertainment.” R. 47-5 (Ex. E: Request\nfrom AACC at 1). Moreover, the 2009 proposal names “promot[ing] the Warren\nAvenue Business District” as one of two objectives for the Festival. R. 47-5 (Ex. E:\nRequest from AACC at 3). As a way of promoting the Warren Avenue Business\nDistrict, the sidewalk tables offer a “quid pro quo for stores negatively impacted by the\nFestival. In exchange for subjecting them to Festival crowds in front of their stores and\nclosed-off streets that block regular customers’ ingress and egress, the existing\nmerchants are permitted to set up tables out front to sell their wares.” 720 F. Supp. 2d\nat 837.\n\fNo. 10-1746        Saieg v. City of Dearborn, et al.                              Page 12\n\n\n       In sum, the leafleting restriction does not use location as a guise for the content\nof speech. Neither the leafleting restriction nor the interest that the defendants seek to\npromote are related to the content of the restricted speech. The restriction, then, is\ncontent neutral.\n\n       2. Substantial Governmental Interest\n\n       The leafleting restriction does not further a substantial governmental interest.\nTime, place, and manner regulations must “‘promote[] a substantial government interest\nthat would be achieved less effectively absent the regulation.’” Ward, 491 U.S. at 799\n(quoting United States v. Albertini, 472 U.S. 675, 689 (1985)). “‘The validity of time,\nplace, or manner regulations does not turn on a judge’s agreement with the responsible\ndecisionmaker concerning the most appropriate method for promoting significant\ngovernment interests’ or the degree to which those interests should be promoted.” Id.\nat 800 (quoting Albertini, 472 U.S. at 689) (internal alteration marks removed).\n\n       The defendants have named several interests that they find significant: relieving\n“pedestrian overcrowding,” enhancing “traffic flow,” minimizing “threats to public\nsafety,” and limiting “disorderliness at the Festival.” Appellee Br. at 37. In appropriate\ncontexts, each of these governmental interests can be substantial. In fact, the interests\nthat the defendants have identified closely parallel the interests that the Supreme Court\nvalidated in Heffron. In Heffron, Minnesota imposed leafleting restrictions at the state\nfair because the state was concerned with “maintain[ing] the orderly movement of the\ncrowd given the large number of exhibitors and persons attending the Fair.” 452 U.S.\nat 649–50. The Supreme Court held that “the State’s interest in confining distribution,\nselling, and fund solicitation activities to fixed locations is sufficient to satisfy the\nrequirement that a place or manner restriction must serve a substantial state interest.”\nId. at 654; see also Madsen v. Women’s Health Ctr., Inc., 512 U.S. 753, 768 (1994)\n(recognizing the state’s “strong interest in ensuring the public safety and order” and “in\npromoting the free flow of traffic on public streets and sidewalks”).\n\n       The defendants must do more, however, than “assert[] interests [that] are\nimportant in the abstract.” Turner Broad. Sys., Inc. v. F.C.C., 512 U.S. 622, 664 (1994).\n\fNo. 10-1746           Saieg v. City of Dearborn, et al.                                        Page 13\n\n\nIn the context of the Festival’s inner perimeter, the interests that the defendants have\nnamed are merely “conjectural,” as opposed to “real.” Id. Two activities that Festival\norganizers permit on sidewalks abutting Warren Avenue erode the significance of the\ngovernment’s interest in restricting leafleting on those same sidewalks. These activities\nare legally relevant because “[e]xemptions from an otherwise legitimate regulation of\na medium of speech . . . may diminish the credibility of the . . . rationale for restricting\nspeech in the first place.” City of Ladue v. Gilleo, 512 U.S. 43, 52 (1994).\n\n         First, Festival organizers keep sidewalks that are adjacent to Warren Avenue\nopen for public traffic. In Heffron, attendees paid an admission fee to enter the\nfairgrounds, 452 U.S. at 658 (Brennan, J., dissenting), which means that the fairgrounds\nwere closed to members of the public who were not attending the fair. In fact, the\nSupreme Court expressly distinguished the fairgrounds in Heffron from a public street.\n452 U.S. at 651. In contrast, Festival organizers have intentionally maintained the public\ncharacter of the sidewalks that are adjacent to the Festival attractions, keeping those\nsidewalks open for traffic that is unrelated to the Festival. R. 47-3 (Ex. C: Beydoun\nDep. at 37) (“We wanted to make sure that the sidewalks [a]re available, whether it’s for\nthe people attending the [F]estival or people [who a]re trying to get from one location\nto another to go to the businesses.”). The sidewalks may well host more traffic during\nthe Festival than they do on other days of the year. Nevertheless, the defendants have\nchosen to keep the sidewalks open for public use, showing that the interests in crowd\ncontrol and public safety are not so pressing that they justify restricting normal activity\nthat occurs on streets and sidewalks. Therefore, because Festival organizers permit\npublic traffic on the sidewalks next to Warren Avenue, the interest in curtailing First\nAmendment expression on those sidewalks is not substantial.3\n\n         Second and more importantly, Festival organizers permit sidewalk vendors on\nthe sidewalks that are adjacent to Warren Avenue, belying the significance of their\ninterest in clear sidewalks and crowd control. The sidewalk vendors have no analog in\n\n         3\n           The district court rejected this argument because Spingola applied Heffron to a two-block fair\non public streets. However, Spingola was an unpublished opinion that did not analyze the issue. To the\nextent that Spingola’s holding runs counter to our analysis, we do not find Spingola persuasive.\n\fNo. 10-1746            Saieg v. City of Dearborn, et al.                                          Page 14\n\n\nthe facts of Heffron, where the fair “confin[ed] individual exhibitors to fixed locations,\nwith the public moving to and among the booths or other attractions, using streets and\nopen spaces provided for that purpose.” 452 U.S. at 650. Leafleting is less obtrusive\nthan sidewalk tables are because “‘[t]he distribution of literature does not require that\nthe recipient stop in order to receive the message the speaker wishes to convey; instead\nthe recipient is free to read the message at a later time.’” Int’l Soc’y for Krishna\nConsciousness, Inc. v. Lee, 505 U.S. 672, 690 (1992) (O’Connor, J., concurring)\n(quoting United States v. Kokinda, 497 U.S. 720, 734 (1990)). The defendants admitted\nat oral argument that leafleters have never posed any problems of public safety or breach\nof the peace at the Festival that could make leafleters more obtrusive than sidewalk\nvendors. By permitting the more obstructive sidewalk tables in the same place where\nSaieg wishes to leaflet by foot, the defendants have undercut the credibility of the\nasserted government interests.4\n\n         The defendants respond than an interest can be substantial even if the state does\nnot promote it in every conceivable way. A restriction on speech can satisfy the time,\nplace, and manner test if the restriction “promotes a substantial government interest that\nwould be achieved less effectively absent the regulation.” Ward, 491 U.S. at 799\n(internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis added). This statement of the law is drawn\nfrom the requirement of narrow tailoring. Immediately after the quoted language, Ward\nclarifies that, “[t]o be sure, this standard [for narrow tailoring] does not mean that a time,\nplace, or manner regulation may burden substantially more speech than is necessary to\nfurther the government’s legitimate interests.” Id. (emphasis added). By analogy, even\nwhen a regulation promotes a government interest that would be achieved less\neffectively absent the regulation, the government’s interest may still be insubstantial if\nthe regulation burdens substantially less speech than is necessary to further the\n\n\n         4\n           The district court’s response to Saieg’s argument is not persuasive. According to the district\ncourt, the Sixth Circuit rejected an argument similar to Saieg’s in Spingola. In Spingola, the plaintiff\n“argue[d] that the regulation does not relieve the crowding and pedestrian flow obstructions that take place\nduring the festival regardless.” 39 F. App’x at 984. Saieg’s argument goes further than saying that the\nregulation is not a panacea for crowd control. Saieg claims that the defendants permit one activity that\nseriously harms the government’s supposed interest at the same time that they ban another activity that\nonly mildly harms that same supposed interest.\n\fNo. 10-1746         Saieg v. City of Dearborn, et al.                                Page 15\n\n\ngovernment’s interest. See City of Ladue, 512 U.S. at 51 (“[T]he notion that a regulation\nof speech may be impermissibly underinclusive is firmly grounded in basic First\nAmendment principles.”); Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co., 514 U.S. 476, 489 (1995)\n(holding that a policy violates the First Amendment because “exemptions and\ninconsistencies bring into question the purpose” of the policy, even though “the\nGovernment’s interest . . . remains a valid goal”); Florida Star v. B.J.F., 491 U.S. 524,\n540 (1989) (holding that “the facial underinclusiveness” of the state’s restriction on\nspeech “raises serious doubts about whether Florida is, in fact, serving . . . the significant\ninterests [that it has] invoke[d] in support” of the policy). In this case, the nature and\nscale of the activities that the defendants permit on the sidewalks adjacent to Warren\nAvenue show that the government’s asserted interests are not substantial in the context\nof those sidewalks.\n\n        With regard to the outer perimeter, the roads and sidewalks are open for\npedestrians in the same way as the sidewalks that are adjacent to Warren Avenue.\nConcerns about crowd control seem to be exclusively conjectural. However, Saieg\nfocuses his argument about the outer perimeter on the question of narrow tailoring. We\nfollow his lead and address the outer perimeter below.\n\n        3. Narrow Tailoring\n\n        The leafleting restriction within the outer perimeter is not narrowly tailored to\nfurther the government’s objectives. To be narrowly tailored, a regulation must not\n“burden substantially more speech than is necessary to further the government’s\nlegitimate interests.” Ward, 491 U.S. at 799. Put differently, the regulation must not be\n“substantially broader than necessary.” Id. at 800. “[W]hen a content-neutral regulation\ndoes not entirely foreclose any means of communication, it may satisfy the tailoring\nrequirement even though it is not the least restrictive or least intrusive means of serving\nthe [state’s] goal.” Hill, 530 U.S. at 726.\n\n        The parties disagree about whether the sidewalks adjacent to the Festival and the\nstreets and sidewalks within the outer perimeter area are “part of” the Festival.\nConsequently, the parties also disagree about whether Saieg seeks to participate in the\n\fNo. 10-1746        Saieg v. City of Dearborn, et al.                             Page 16\n\n\nFestival or to leaflet near the Festival, a distinction that informs their arguments about\nnarrow tailoring. This debate is a red herring. The narrow-tailoring requirement focuses\non the nexus between the regulation and the government’s interest. Grace, 461 U.S. at\n181. The government’s interests need not be coterminous with “the Festival” as a\nmonolithic area, and the government may have different interests in different areas of the\nFestival or near the Festival. As a result, whether these locations are classified as part\nof “the Festival” does not determine whether the leafleting restriction is narrowly\ntailored to accomplish the government’s interests.\n\n       Saieg has not requested to leaflet on Warren Avenue. Moreover, Saieg has not\ndisputed that the restriction on leafleting within the inner perimeter—the sidewalks\nadjacent to Warren Avenue—is narrowly tailored. Saieg, 720 F. Supp. 2d at 839\n(“Plaintiff does not mount a ‘narrow tailoring’ challenge with respect to the enforcement\nof the handbilling ban in the inner perimeter.”). As explained above, we agree with\nSaieg that the inner-perimeter restriction on leafleting does not further a substantial\ngovernment interest, making the question of narrow tailoring irrelevant.\n\n       The restriction on leafleting within the outer perimeter is substantially broader\nthan necessary to further the government’s interests, assuming that those interests are\nsubstantial. In reaching the opposite conclusion, the district court and the defendants\ncorrectly analyze the issue from the perspective of permitting everyone to leaflet, not\nonly Saieg. See Heffron, 452 U.S. at 653 (“Obviously, there would be a much larger\nthreat to the State’s interest in crowd control if all other religious, nonreligious, and\nnoncommercial organizations could likewise move freely about the fairgrounds\ndistributing and selling literature and soliciting funds at will.”). The district court,\nhowever, used that perspective to magnify an unsubstantiated fear. “[M]ere speculation\nabout danger” is not an adequate basis on which to justify a restriction of speech. Bay\nArea Peace Navy v. United States, 914 F.2d 1224, 1228 (9th Cir. 1990); see also Turner\nBroad. Sys., Inc., 512 U.S. at 664 (requiring that the government “demonstrate that the\nrecited harms are real, not merely conjectural, and that the regulation will in fact\nalleviate these harms in a direct and material way”). Although the government has an\n\fNo. 10-1746         Saieg v. City of Dearborn, et al.                                Page 17\n\n\ninterest in crowd control, the defendants “must do more than simply posit the existence\nof the disease sought to be cured.” Turner Broad. Sys., Inc., 512 U.S. at 664 (internal\nquotation marks omitted); see also Klein v. City of San Clemente, 584 F.3d 1196, 1202\n(9th Cir. 2009) (“[M]erely invoking interests is insufficient. The government must also\nshow that the proposed communicative activity endangers those interests.” (internal\nalteration marks and quotation marks omitted)), cert. denied, 130 S. Ct. 1706 (2010).\nThe district court neglected these principles by concluding that throngs of people “would\nall flock to the outer perimeter to promote their respective interests and messages,”\nthereby “extend[ing] the Festival grounds into an area that is meant to serve as a buffer\nzone between the Festival and the outside world.” Saieg, 720 F. Supp. 2d at 840. The\nweakness in the district court’s argument is that the primary justification for the outer\nperimeter is to curb vehicular traffic and provide parking, not to cabin pedestrian crowds.\nDespite the district court’s speculation, the record does not mention any existing problem\nof pedestrian traffic in the outer perimeter area. Saieg leaflets by foot. While his\nleafleting might attract pedestrian listeners who would congregate on the sidewalks, it\nis hard to imagine that leafleters, who would be competing with more interesting\nattractions on Warren Avenue, could draw crowds so large that the Festival would\nballoon outward. Attracting merely a few listeners on a sidewalk would not implicate\na substantial governmental interest in crowd control.\n\n        Beydoun’s testimony mirrors the hyperbole of the district court: “if you allowed\nsomeone to distribute literature within [the] outer area, you might as well allow the other\nstreet vendors to set up tables and start selling things in that area, too. That is the buffer\nbetween going in and going out. You [have] got to maintain a security area.” R. 47-3\n(Ex. C: Beydoun Dep. at 58). Beydoun’s worry is exaggerated. Although “[t]he\njustification for the [challenged rule] should not be measured by the disorder that would\nresult from granting an exemption solely to” the challenging party, Heffron, 452 U.S. at\n652, permitting everyone to leaflet in the outer perimeter area does not require the city\nto permit street vending or other attractions in the area defined by the outer perimeter.\nInstead, by invalidating the leafleting restriction, we hold only that the defendants must\n\fNo. 10-1746        Saieg v. City of Dearborn, et al.                              Page 18\n\n\npermit speech—including, but not limited to, archetypical First Amendment activity such\nas distributing leaflets, books, or DVDs.\n\n       The restriction on pedestrian leafleting is substantially broader than necessary\nto further the interest in vehicular traffic control and parking. In other words, the\nrestriction is not narrowly tailored because there is “an insufficient nexus” between the\ngovernment’s asserted interest and the leafleting restriction. Grace, 461 U.S. at 181.\n\n       4. Ample Alternative Channels of Communication\n\n       We do not decide whether the restriction on leafleting leaves Saieg with ample\nalternative methods of communicating to his target audience. Any time, place, and\nmanner restriction must leave open ample alternative channels by which speakers can\ncommunicate their messages, although speakers are “not entitled to [their] best means\nof communication.” Phelps-Roper, 539 F.3d at 372. “An alternative is not ample if the\nspeaker is not permitted to reach the intended audience.” Bay Area Peace Navy, 914\nF.2d at 1229 (internal quotation marks omitted). The requirements for a time, place, and\nmanner restriction are conjunctive. See, e.g., Watchtower Bible & Tract Soc’y of New\nYork, Inc. v. Village of Stratton, 536 U.S. 150, 168–69 (2002) (invalidating an ordinance\nthat served a substantial government interest because it was not narrowly\ntailored—without discussing whether ample alternative channels of communication\nexisted). Thus, the leafleting restriction is unconstitutional even if it leaves open ample\nalternative channels of communication.\n\n       5. Summary\n\n       Even though the leafleting restriction is content neutral and might provide ample\nalternative means of communication, the policy is not a reasonable time, place, and\nmanner restriction.    Within the inner perimeter, the restriction does not serve a\nsubstantial governmental interest, as evidenced by the defendants’ willingness to permit\nsidewalk vendors and ordinary pedestrian traffic on the same sidewalks where they\nprohibited Saieg from leafleting. Within the outer perimeter area, the restriction is not\n\fNo. 10-1746           Saieg v. City of Dearborn, et al.                                        Page 19\n\n\nnarrowly tailored because the government’s interest in vehicular traffic control is\nattenuated from concern about pedestrian crowds that pedestrian leafleting might draw.5\n\n         Saieg has requested, in the event that this court rules in his favor, “that the\ndecision be crafted to prevent Defendants from circumventing it by playing a game of\nshifting ‘perimeters.’” Reply Br. at 1 n.1. Our holding is not predicated on the\nboundaries of the Festival or a distinction between the inner and outer perimeters. Saieg\nand other members of the public may leaflet from any street or sidewalk that remains\nopen for typical, non-Festival pedestrian traffic, even if the street or sidewalk is\nsimultaneously used for Festival traffic. We note that, should the City’s conjectural\nharms come to pass, the City can move to modify the injunction. Deja Vu of Nashville,\nInc. v. Metro. Gov’t of Nashville & Davidson Cnty., 466 F.3d 391, 395 (6th Cir. 2006),\ncert. denied, 549 U.S. 1339 (2007).\n\n         In addition to declarative and injunctive relief, Saieg is entitled to nominal\ndamages for the violation of his constitutional rights. See Carey v. Piphus, 435 U.S. 247,\n266 (1978).\n\nC. Freedom of Association\n\n         Saieg’s freedom-of-association claim lacks merit. The freedom to associate\nprotects “choices to enter into and maintain certain intimate human relationships” as well\nas “associat[ion] for the purpose of engaging in those activities protected by the First\nAmendment.” Roberts v. United States Jaycees, 468 U.S. 609, 617–18 (1984). Unless\nthey promote compelling state interests, government actions violate the freedom of\nassociation when, for example, they “seek to impose penalties or withhold benefits from\nindividuals because of their membership in a disfavored group; . . . attempt to require\ndisclosure of the fact of membership in a group seeking anonymity; . . . [or] try to\ninterfere with the internal organization or affairs of the group.” Id. at 622–23 (internal\n\n\n\n         5\n           Although Saieg has sought to leaflet on the sidewalks adjacent to Warren Avenue and Miller\nRoad, he has repeatedly declined to request permission to leaflet on those streets themselves. Appellant\nBr. at 2. Because Saieg has not raised the issue, we have no occasion to decide whether Saieg may leaflet\non those streets.\n\fNo. 10-1746          Saieg v. City of Dearborn, et al.                               Page 20\n\n\ncitations omitted).     Even though Saieg has been deprived of one outlet for his\nassociation’s expression, his freedom to associate has not been abridged in any way\ncomparable to these examples. Saieg is free to associate even at the Festival. Only\nleafleting, not association, has been restricted.\n\nD. Free Exercise of Religion\n\n          Saieg abandoned his free exercise claim before the district court. 720 F. Supp.\n2d at 841. He has not contested the waiver on appeal. Therefore, his free exercise claim\nis not one that we must consider. Doe v. Bredesen, 507 F.3d 998, 1007 (6th Cir. 2007),\ncert. denied, 129 S. Ct. 287 (2008).\n\nE. Equal Protection\n\n          The leafleting restriction does not violate the Equal Protection Clause. Saieg\nargues that the leafleting restriction distinguishes by content between religious leaflets\nand commercial sidewalk tables. He relies on Police Department of City of Chicago v.\nMosley, 408 U.S. 92, 96 (1972), which held that “[s]elective exclusions from a public\nforum may not be based on content alone, and may not be justified by reference to\ncontent alone.” Unlike the restriction in Mosley, however, the restriction in this case\ndoes not “describe[] permissible [speech] in terms of its subject matter.” Id. at 95.\nInstead, sidewalk tables are permissible according to the location of the organization that\noperates them, not the subject matter of the message that the organization conveys. See\nsupra Section II.B.1. Therefore, the restriction does not violate the Equal Protection\nClause.\n\nF. City’s Liability\n\n          The City may be held liable for the restriction of Saieg’s free speech rights that\nthe leafleting restriction caused. A municipality is liable if a constitutional injury results\nfrom a policy or custom “made by its lawmakers or by those whose edicts or acts may\nfairly be said to represent official policy.” Monell v. Dep’t of Soc. Servs., 436 U.S. 658,\n694–95 (1978). In this case, the City approved the Festival “subject to . . . the rules and\nregulations of the Police Department.” R. 47-13 (Ex. M: Council Resolution).\n\fNo. 10-1746         Saieg v. City of Dearborn, et al.                              Page 21\n\n\nAlthough the AACC also wanted to prohibit leafleting, Chief Haddad described the\nleafleting policy as his department’s policy, subject only to the approval of the city\ncouncil and the mayor. R. 47-11 (Ex. K: Haddad Dep. at 95–96) (stating that “the\npolice department will supply the standards that must be met,” such as the “prohibition\nof individuals handing out . . . materials on the public sidewalk”). The police\ndepartment’s leafleting policy, made with the authority that the City Council delegated\nto it, fairly represents official City policy. Therefore, Saieg may hold the City liable for\nviolating his First Amendment right to free speech.\n\n        However, the City is not liable for claims of selective enforcement. Because the\nargument portion of Saieg’s appellate brief does not identify or provide citations for any\ninstances of selective enforcement, Saieg has waived the claim. Even considering the\nmerits of Saieg’s claim, the district court properly found that the incidents of supposedly\nselective enforcement were not “so widespread as to have the force of law,” Bd. of Cnty.\nComm’rs of Bryan Cnty. v. Brown, 520 U.S. 397, 403–04 (1997), and are not actions\nascribable to Chief Haddad as opposed to individual officers. 720 F. Supp. 2d at 844.\n\n                                  III.

In contrast to the\nmajority here, I am persuaded that the restrictions on leafleting imposed during the Arab\nInternational Festival did not violate the plaintiff’s First Amendment right to free speech.\nThose restrictions constituted a reasonable time, place, and manner limitation in service\nof a substantial government interest, and they were sufficiently narrowly tailored to\nfurther that substantial interest, as the district court held in a thoughtful and well-\ndocumented opinion granting summary judgment to the City of Dearborn and its Chief\nof Police. While I would normally set out an analysis to support this conclusion, there\nis no reason to delay issuance of the majority’s order in this expedited appeal, given that\nthe district court has provided a masterful explanation for judgment in the defendants’\nfavor. I therefore dissent for reasons set out in the district court’s opinion and order filed\non June 7, 2010.\n\f",

Laurie M. Ellerbrake, Dearborn, Michigan, for Appellees. ON BRIEF: Robert Joseph Muise, Thomas More Law Center, Ann Arbor, Michigan, for Appellant. Laurie M. Ellerbrake, Dearborn, Michigan, for Appellees.</p>\n<p>Before: DAUGHTREY, MOORE, and CLAY, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>MOORE, J., delivered the opinion of the court, in which CLAY, J., joined. DAUGHTREY, J. (p. 743), delivered a separate dissenting opinion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>OPINION</h2>\n<p>KAREN NELSON MOORE, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>Each summer, Plaintiff George Saieg attends the Arab International Festival (\"Festival\") in the City of Dearborn, Michigan (\"City\"). At the Festival, Saieg leads a group of Christians whose goal is to convert Muslims to Christianity. In 2009, Dearborn police instituted a leafleting restriction for the Festival. Pursuant to the restriction, no one may leaflet from the sidewalks that are directly adjacent to the Festival attractions, or on the sidewalks and roads that surround the Festival's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*730</span> core on each side by one to five city blocks. The restriction permits leafleting at the Festival only from a stationary booth and not while walking around the Festival.</p>\n<p>Saieg sued the City of Dearborn and its Chief of Police, alleging that the leafleting restriction violated his First Amendment right to free speech, as well as his freedom to associate, his free exercise of religion, and his right to equal protection. The district court denied a temporary restraining order before the 2009 Festival and granted summary judgment to the defendants in 2010. This court granted Saieg an injunction pending appeal for the 2010 Festival, permitting Saieg to distribute leaflets from the outer sidewalks and roads, but not on the sidewalks that are directly adjacent to the Festival attractions.</p>\n<p>On the free speech claim, we REVERSE the district court's grant of summary judgment to the defendants and its denial of summary judgment to the plaintiffs. We thereby invalidate the leafleting restriction within both the inner and outer perimeters of the Festival.<sup>[1]</sup> The restriction on the sidewalks that are directly adjacent to the Festival attractions does not serve a substantial government interest. The City keeps those same sidewalks open for public traffic and permits sidewalk vendors, whose activity is more obstructive to sidewalk traffic flow than pedestrian leafleting is. Moreover, the prohibition of <i>pedestrian</i> leafleting in the outer perimeter is not narrowly tailored to the goal of isolating inner areas from <i>vehicular</i> traffic. The City can be held liable because the Chief of Police, who instituted the leafleting restriction, created official municipal policy. We AFFIRM the district court's judgment for the defendants on all other claims. We REMAND to the district court for such further proceedings as are consistent with this opinion that may be warranted.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Substantive Facts</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. The Arab International Festival</h2>\n<p>The American Arab Chamber of Commerce (\"AACC\") organizes the Festival, which is free and open to the public. Each year, over 250,000 people attend the Festival, which features carnival rides, a main stage with live entertainment, international food, merchandise sales, a tent targeted at children, and tents in which artisans and other vendors display products. In 2009, forty artisan vendors, twenty-five information tables, fourteen food vendors, and seventeen sponsor booths took part in the Festival. These attractions are all located within the \"inner perimeter\" of the Festival: the eight blocks of Warren Avenue between Hartwell Street to the west and Kingsley Street to the east, as well as one block south on Miller Road, which intersects Warren Avenue. Due to the scale of the event, officers from the Dearborn Police Department supply extensive security and support the Festival from a \"[c]ommand post trailer.\" R. 47-11 (Ex. K: Haddad dep. at 52). The resolution authorizing the Festival \"subject[s]\" the Festival to \"the rules and regulations of the Police Department.\" R. 47-13 (Ex. M: Council Resolution)</p>\n<p>Businesses located along the inner perimeter on Warren Avenue can obtain permits to display and sell their goods on the sidewalks outside their storefronts. Although the City itself issued the sidewalk <span class=\"star-pagination\">*731</span> permits prior to 2009, the City now delegates authority to issue the permits to the AACC. Businesses and organizations not located on Warren Avenue can purchase an information table. In fact, if businesses or organizations wish to distribute materials, the City's police department <i>requires</i> that the distribution occur from a \"fixed location,\" which in practice means an information table located in the street, not on the sidewalk. R. 47-8 (Ex. H: Mrowka dep. at 32). \"[H]andbilling along the sidewalks that are adjacent to the [F]estival\" is not permitted. R. 47-3 (Ex. C: Beydoun dep. 35). Police officers are expected to warn anyone who distributes leaflets and, if the person continues, to arrest the offender. Dearborn Chief of Police Ronald Haddad, who assumed his position shortly before the 2009 Festival and has prior experience with crowd control in other capacities, testified that a similar policy is in place at the Michigan State Fair. The Michigan State Fair \"will not allow you to give out a paper clip unless you're stationary and at a booth. It just makes good sense, it's a good practice[,] and it's not a standard that is applied indiscriminately[;] it's across the board.\" R. 47-11 (Ex. K: Haddad Dep. at 95). Fay Beydoun, Executive Director of the AACC, testified that the leafleting policy exists \"to make sure that the sidewalks [a]re available, whether it's for the people attending the [F]estival or people [who a]re trying to get from one location to another to go to the businesses\" along Warren Avenue. R. 47-3 (Ex. C: Beydoun Dep. at 37); <i>see also</i> R. 47-11 (Ex. K: Haddad Dep. at 18) (\"[K]nowing that it [i]s going to be a very crowded situation, we ... do our very best to keep the sidewalks flowing.\").</p>\n<p>To accommodate Festival traffic, the City barricades the roads within an \"outer perimeter\" or \"buffer zone\" that surrounds the inner perimeter. Although the outer perimeter does not contain attractions, it services the Festival by \"restrict[ing] traffic,\" R. 47-8 (Ex. H: Mrowka Dep. at 15), and \"giv[ing] [vehicular] traffic some final point to turn away from the Warren Avenue destination,\" R. 47-11 (Ex. K: Haddad Dep. at 26-27). The outer perimeter also enhances \"crowd control [leading] into the [F]estival area.\" R. 47-8 (Ex. H: Mrowka Dep. at 15). Finally, the outer perimeter includes parking for Festival attendees and vendors, as well as for displaced employees of Warren Avenue businesses and any of those businesses' patrons who are not attending the Festival. R. 47-3 (Ex. C: Beydoun Dep. at 43-44). The outer perimeter stretches one block north of Warren Avenue (Morrow Circle), one block south of Warren Avenue (Blesser Avenue), five blocks west of Hartwell Street (Schaefer Road), and four blocks east of Kingsley Street (Wyoming Avenue).</p>\n<p>The restriction on leafleting applies in the outer perimeter area as well. Beydoun explained why: \"if you allowed someone to distribute literature within [the] outer area, you might as well allow the other street vendors to set up tables and start selling things in that area, too. That is the buffer between going in and going out. You [have] to maintain a security area.\" R. 47-3 (Ex. C: Beydoun Dep. at 58).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Saieg and the Arabic Christian Perspective</h2>\n<p>Saieg founded the Arabic Christian Perspective (\"ACP\"), a now-defunct \"national ministry established for the purpose of proclaiming the Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ to Muslims. As part of its outreach efforts, ACP travel[ed] around the country attending and distributing Christian literature at festivals and mosques.\" R. 13 (Amended Compl. ¶ 9). Because the City is home to a \"big Muslim community,\" the Festival provides Saieg the opportunity to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*732</span> evangelize \"thousands of Muslims in one place.\" R. 48 (Ex. A: Saieg Dep. at 42, 44). Before each Festival, the ACP operated an annual event called \"Facing the Muslim Challenge.\" In 2009, the program featured panel discussions, workshops on \"[e]ffectively witnessing to Muslims,\" debates, door-to-door outreach, and mosque tours. R. 47-2 (Ex. B: Program). The program culminated in outreach at the Festival. At each Festival from 2004 to 2008, Saieg and 90 to 120 ACP members distributed leaflets from the public sidewalks that abut Warren Avenue.</p>\n<p>In 2009, Saieg had planned for 90 ACP members to continue the practice of leafleting while roaming the Festival. However, when Saieg shared these plans with a City police sergeant, Saieg learned that the new Chief of Police, Chief Haddad, would not permit anyone to distribute leaflets while walking around the Festival. Instead, the City provided the ACP with a booth, waiving the standard fee. The booth was poorly lit and located by carnival rides, which attracted mostly children. This problem was remedied in 2010, when the ACP's booth was lit and located \"in the central area.\" <i>Saieg v. City of Dearborn,</i> 720 F.Supp.2d 817, 834-35 (E.D.Mich.2010) (describing then-upcoming plans for the 2010 festival). Saieg also faces a more basic problem with booth-based evangelism: \"[t]he penalty of leaving Islam according to Islamic books is death,\" which makes Muslims reluctant to approach a booth that is publicly \"labeled as ... Christian.\" R. 48 (Ex. A: Saieg Dep. at 75). Saieg believes that evangelism is more effective when he can roam the Festival and speak to Muslims more discreetly. The ACP distributed 37,000 packets of religious materials in 2007 and 20,000 packets in 2008, but only 500 packets in 2009 due to the remote, fixed location. Numbers from 2010 are not in the record.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Procedural History</h2>\n<p>On June 16, 2009, Saieg and ACP sued the City and Chief Haddad for violating their First Amendment rights to free speech, free association, and free exercise of religion, in addition to violating the Equal Protection Clause. Saieg has specified that \"this is not a facial challenge\" to the leafleting restriction but \"an as-applied challenge.\" Appellant Br. at 38. Moreover, Saieg has \"at <i>no</i> time ... requested to engage in his religious activity on Warren Avenue or Miller Road,\" although he has asked to leaflet on the sidewalks that are adjacent to those roads. <i>Id.</i> at 2. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, attorney fees and costs, and nominal damages. Two days after the plaintiffs filed their complaint, the district court denied a temporary restraining order. At the 2009 Festival, the plaintiffs distributed leaflets from the inconveniently located booth.</p>\n<p>The ACP was dismissed from the case after the organization dissolved. On June 7, 2010, the district court denied Saieg's motion for summary judgment and granted summary judgment to the defendants. The district court held that the leafleting restriction was a valid time, place, and manner restriction, relying heavily on <i>Heffron v. International Society for Krishna Consciousness,</i> 452 U.S. 640, 101 S.Ct. 2559, 69 L.Ed.2d 298 (1981), and the Sixth Circuit's application of <i>Heffron</i> in <i>Spingola v. Village of Granville,</i> 39 Fed.Appx. 978 (6th Cir.2002) (unpublished opinion). The district court reasoned that Saieg retains alternative channels of communication, even though they are not his preferred channels, because he could \"orally propagat[e] [his] religious views,\" distribute materials from a booth, and distribute materials outside of the Festival. <i>Saieg,</i> 720 F.Supp.2d at 834-35. The leafleting restriction is content neutral, said the district <span class=\"star-pagination\">*733</span> court, because permitting Warren Avenue businesses to have sidewalk sales \"favor[s], if anyone, those with space along Warren Avenue no matter who they are or what their message\" is. <i>Id.</i> at 837. The leafleting restriction serves a substantial government interest \"in ensuring the orderly flow of pedestrian traffic through the crowded Festival.\" <i>Id.</i> at 838. Finally, the district court found that the restriction is narrowly tailored because allowing everyone to distribute leaflets in the outer perimeter area would \"effectively extend the Festival grounds into an area that is meant to serve as a buffer zone between the Festival and the outside world.\" <i>Id.</i> at 840. Even though streets and sidewalks are traditionally public fora, \"[f]or three days out of the year, the streets and sidewalks of the outer perimeter ... are serving an entirely different role.\" <i>Id.</i> The district court found that Saieg had abandoned his free exercise claim, and also disposed of the freedom of association and equal protection claims. Finally, the district court found that the City was not liable under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 because there was no constitutional violation. The four instances of selective enforcement that Saieg highlighted were \"insufficient to show that selective enforcement ... was so widespread as to have the force of law,\" and Saieg had not shown that the selective enforcement stemmed from official policy. <i>Id.</i> at 844 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>Saieg appealed to the Sixth Circuit and filed an emergency motion for expedited review. On June 17, 2010, this court ruled that Saieg was likely to succeed on the merits of his claim because, although <i>Heffron</i> and <i>Spingola</i> \"may support the restriction of leaflet distribution among the crowds within the core area of the Festival, they do not appear to preclude similar activity in the `outer perimeter' or `buffer zone' leading up to the core area.\" Sixth Circuit 06/17/10 Order at 3. The panel therefore granted Saieg's motion for an injunction pending appeal, permitting Saieg \"to distribute his religious literature in the streets contained within ... the `outer perimeter' or `buffer zone,'\" but not \"within the Festival itself.\" <i>Id.</i> That order expired after the 2010 Festival. <i>Id.</i> The 16th annual Festival will be held June 17-19, 2011. <i>Arab International Festival,</i> www.americanarab.com/events-a-programs/business-development.html.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. DISCUSSION</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Standard of Review</h2>\n<p>When a district court denies a permanent injunction, we review the court's legal conclusions de novo, its factual findings for clear error, and the scope of the injunction for abuse of discretion. <i>Worldwide Basketball &amp; Sport Tours, Inc. v. NCAA,</i> 388 F.3d 955, 958 (6th Cir.2004), <i>cert. denied,</i> 546 U.S. 813, 126 S.Ct. 334, 163 L.Ed.2d 47 (2005). \"A party is entitled to a permanent injunction if it can establish that it suffered a constitutional violation and will suffer continuing irreparable injury for which there is no adequate remedy at law.\" <i>Wedgewood Ltd. P'ship I v. Twp. of Liberty,</i> 610 F.3d 340, 349 (6th Cir.2010) (internal quotation marks omitted), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 131 S.Ct. 1007, 178 L.Ed.2d 828 (2011).</p>\n<p>The district court granted the defendants summary judgment on the first pointwhether Saieg suffered a constitutional violation. That is a legal question, so the standard of review coincides with the de novo standard that we apply to summary judgments generally. <i>Id.</i> \"The court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). \"We review <span class=\"star-pagination\">*734</span> cross motions for summary judgment under this standard as well, evaluating each motion on its own merits.\" <i>La Quinta Corp. v. Heartland Props. LLC,</i> 603 F.3d 327, 335 (6th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Free Speech</h2>\n<p>Following the Supreme Court's guidance in <i>Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense &amp; Educational Fund, Inc.,</i> 473 U.S. 788, 797, 105 S.Ct. 3439, 87 L.Ed.2d 567 (1985), we analyze free speech claims in three steps. <i>Parks v. City of Columbus,</i> 395 F.3d 643, 647 (6th Cir.2005). The first step is to determine whether the plaintiff's conduct is protected speech. <i>Id.</i> Saieg's conduct is clearly protected. \"`[T]he hand distribution of religious tracts is an age-old form of missionary evangelism,' <i>Murdock v. Pennsylvania,</i> 319 U.S. 105, 108, 63 S.Ct. 870, 87 L.Ed. 1292 (1943), and such activity `has the same claim as [oral and written dissemination] to the guarantee[] of freedom of speech ...,' <i>id.</i> at 109, 63 S.Ct. 870.\" <i>Parks,</i> 395 F.3d at 647.</p>\n<p>The second step is to \"`identify the nature of the forum, because the extent to which the Government may limit access depends on whether the forum is public or nonpublic.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Cornelius,</i> 473 U.S. at 797, 105 S.Ct. 3439). Public streets and sidewalks \"are `quintessential' public forums for free speech,\" <i>Hill v. Colorado,</i> 530 U.S. 703, 715, 120 S.Ct. 2480, 147 L.Ed.2d 597 (2000); <i>see also </i><i>Frisby v. Schultz,</i> 487 U.S. 474, 480-81, 108 S.Ct. 2495, 101 L.Ed.2d 420 (1988), although \"there have been limited circumstances where public streets or sidewalks are not considered public fora,\" <i>Parks,</i> 395 F.3d at 648 (mentioning sidewalks by post offices and sidewalks in military reservations). Restrictions on speech in traditional public fora must either be (1) reasonable time, place, and manner regulations or (2) \"narrowly drawn to accomplish a compelling governmental interest.\" <i>United States v. Grace,</i> 461 U.S. 171, 177, 103 S.Ct. 1702, 75 L.Ed.2d 736 (1983). In general, then, \"the government's ability to permissibly restrict expressive conduct\" on public streets and sidewalks \"is very limited.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>The parties disagree about whether the streets and sidewalks within the inner and outer perimeters were functioning as traditional public fora or limited public fora<sup>[2]</sup> during the Festival. <i>Compare </i><i>Parks,</i> 395 F.3d at 652 (holding that \"the streets remained a traditional public forum notwithstanding the special[, non-exclusive] permit\" that allowed a private group to operate a public Arts Festival on public streets), <i>with </i><i>Spingola,</i> 39 Fed.Appx. at 983 (holding that the \"public streets\" were \"not serving in th[eir traditional] function during the festival\"); <i>see also </i><i>Heffron,</i> 452 U.S. at 651, 101 S.Ct. 2559 (explaining that the Minnesota Fair, which is \"a temporary event attracting great numbers of visitors,\" presents problems of traffic flow and crowd control that make \"any comparisons to public streets ... necessarily inexact\"). This disagreement, however, is not germane to the free speech issue in this case. If a rule is \"content-neutral, [then] the appropriate test is intermediate scrutiny,\" even when the rule governs speech in a traditional public forum. <i>Phelps-Roper v. Strickland,</i> 539 F.3d 356, 361-62 (6th Cir. 2008); <i>see also </i><i>Spingola,</i> 39 Fed.Appx. at 983 (\"[R]egardless of whether we would <span class=\"star-pagination\">*735</span> classify the ... festival area as a traditional public forum or a limited public forum..., the Ordinance is examined under the same intermediate level of scrutiny.\"). As explained below, the leafleting restriction is content neutral.</p>\n<p>Therefore, it is the third step that decides this case: \"whether the justifications for exclusion from the relevant forum satisfy the requisite standard.\" <i>Cornelius,</i> 473 U.S. at 797, 105 S.Ct. 3439. The requisite principle applicable to this case is that \"[t]ime, place, and manner restrictions may be enforced even in a <i>traditional public forum</i> so long as they are content neutral, are narrowly tailored to serve a significant government interest, and leave open ample alternative channels of communication.\" <i>M.A.L. ex rel. M.L. v. Kinsland,</i> 543 F.3d 841, 850 (6th Cir.2008). The leafleting restriction does not satisfy this standard.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Content Neutrality</h2>\n<p>The leafleting restriction is content neutral. Whether a restriction on speech is content neutral has substantial bearing on the constitutionality of the restriction because \"the government is held to a very exacting and rarely satisfied standard when it disfavors the discussion of particular subjects or particular viewpoints within a given subject matter.\" <i>Hill,</i> 530 U.S. at 735, 120 S.Ct. 2480 (Souter, J., concurring) (internal citations omitted). Government regulations of speech are content neutral if they are \"justified without reference to the content or viewpoint of the regulated speech.\" <i>Christian </i><i>Legal Soc'y Chapter of the Univ. of Cal., Hastings Coll. of the Law v. Martinez,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 130 S.Ct. 2971, 2994, 177 L.Ed.2d 838 (2010) (internal alterations and quotation marks omitted); <i>see also </i><i>Hill,</i> 530 U.S. at 719, 120 S.Ct. 2480 (\"`The principal inquiry ... is whether the government has adopted a regulation of speech because of disagreement with the message it conveys.'\" (quoting <i>Ward v. Rock Against Racism,</i> 491 U.S. 781, 791, 109 S.Ct. 2746, 105 L.Ed.2d 661 (1989))). \"The government's purpose is the controlling consideration.\" <i>Ward,</i> 491 U.S. at 791, 109 S.Ct. 2746. \"[D]ifferential impact\" without more does not demonstrate that a regulation is content based. <i>Christian </i><i>Legal Soc'y,</i> 130 S.Ct. at 2994.</p>\n<p>Requiring that all literature be distributed from a stationary location is a content-neutral regulation. Designating \"specific areas for specific things\" at the Festival, R. 47-3 (Ex. C: Beydoun dep. at 33), \"is not a `regulation of speech.' Rather, it is a regulation of the places where some speech may occur.\" <i>Hill,</i> 530 U.S. at 719, 120 S.Ct. 2480. Supporting this conclusion is the fact that \"the State's interests\" in crowd control and public safety \"are unrelated to the content of [the regulated] speech.\" <i>Id.</i> at 719-20, 120 S.Ct. 2480. In addition, Saieg has not produced evidence that the regulation was \"adopted `because of disagreement with the message [that his speech] conveys.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 719, 120 S.Ct. 2480 (quoting <i>Ward,</i> 491 U.S. at 791, 109 S.Ct. 2746).</p>\n<p>Saieg argues that the leafleting restriction is content based because it privileges commercial speech over noncommercial speech. He points to the City's practice of letting Warren Avenue storefronts erect sidewalk tables, whereas he cannot distribute materials from the same sidewalk. This argument misapprehends the criterion for who can vend from the sidewalk. The criterion is location, not content or type (commercial or noncommercial) of speech. Any entity with a storefront on Warren Avenue can set up sidewalk table, and no one without a storefront can become a sidewalk vendor. R. 47-3 (Ex. C: Beydoun Dep. at 64-65). The defendants do not inquire into whether the sidewalk <span class=\"star-pagination\">*736</span> vendor is commercial or noncommercial, and the defendants do not screen the messages that sidewalk tables convey for content.</p>\n<p>The AACC's proposal for the 2009 Festival confirms that location of the speakers, not the content of their speech, is the criterion for permitting sidewalk sales. The AACC describes \"sidewalk sales ... by merchants on Warren Ave[nue]\" as a component of the Festival, alongside the \"main stage, children's tent, vendor tents, artisan's tents,\" \"carnival,\" and \"[f]ood and entertainment.\" R. 47-5 (Ex. E: Request from AACC at 1). Moreover, the 2009 proposal names \"promot[ing] the Warren Avenue Business District\" as one of two objectives for the Festival. R. 47-5 (Ex. E: Request from AACC at 3). As a way of promoting the Warren Avenue Business District, the sidewalk tables offer a \"quid pro quo for stores negatively impacted by the Festival. In exchange for subjecting them to Festival crowds in front of their stores and closed-off streets that block regular customers' ingress and egress, the existing merchants are permitted to set up tables out front to sell their wares.\" 720 F.Supp.2d at 837.</p>\n<p>In sum, the leafleting restriction does not use location as a guise for the content of speech. Neither the leafleting restriction nor the interest that the defendants seek to promote are related to the content of the restricted speech. The restriction, then, is content neutral.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Substantial Governmental Interest</h2>\n<p>The leafleting restriction does not further a substantial governmental interest. Time, place, and manner regulations must \"`promote[] a substantial government interest that would be achieved less effectively absent the regulation.'\" <i>Ward,</i> 491 U.S. at 799, 109 S.Ct. 2746 (quoting <i>United States v. Albertini,</i> 472 U.S. 675, 689, 105 S.Ct. 2897, 86 L.Ed.2d 536 (1985)). \"`The validity of time, place, or manner regulations does not turn on a judge's agreement with the responsible decisionmaker concerning the most appropriate method for promoting significant government interests' or the degree to which those interests should be promoted.\" <i>Id.</i> at 800, 109 S.Ct. 2746 (quoting <i>Albertini,</i> 472 U.S. at 689, 105 S.Ct. 2897) (internal alteration marks removed).</p>\n<p>The defendants have named several interests that they find significant: relieving \"pedestrian overcrowding,\" enhancing \"traffic flow,\" minimizing \"threats to public safety,\" and limiting \"disorderliness at the Festival.\" Appellee Br. at 37. In appropriate contexts, each of these governmental interests can be substantial. In fact, the interests that the defendants have identified closely parallel the interests that the Supreme Court validated in <i>Heffron.</i> In <i>Heffron,</i> Minnesota imposed leafleting restrictions at the state fair because the state was concerned with \"maintain[ing] the orderly movement of the crowd given the large number of exhibitors and persons attending the Fair.\" 452 U.S. at 649-50, 101 S.Ct. 2559. The Supreme Court held that \"the State's interest in confining distribution, selling, and fund solicitation activities to fixed locations is sufficient to satisfy the requirement that a place or manner restriction must serve a substantial state interest.\" <i>Id.</i> at 654, 101 S.Ct. 2559; <i>see also </i><i>Madsen v. Women's Health Ctr., Inc.,</i> 512 U.S. 753, 768, 114 S.Ct. 2516, 129 L.Ed.2d 593 (1994) (recognizing the state's \"strong interest in ensuring the public safety and order\" and \"in promoting the free flow of traffic on public streets and sidewalks\").</p>\n<p>The defendants must do more, however, than \"assert[] interests [that] are important in the abstract.\" <i>Turner Broad. Sys., Inc. v. F.C.C.</i> 512 U.S. 622, 664, 114 S.Ct. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*737</span> 2445, 129 L.Ed.2d 497 (1994). In the context of the Festival's inner perimeter, the interests that the defendants have named are merely \"conjectural,\" as opposed to \"real.\" <i>Id.</i> Two activities that Festival organizers permit on sidewalks abutting Warren Avenue erode the significance of the government's interest in restricting leafleting on those same sidewalks. These activities are legally relevant because \"[e]xemptions from an otherwise legitimate regulation of a medium of speech ... may diminish the credibility of the ... rationale for restricting speech in the first place.\" <i>City of Ladue v. Gilleo,</i> 512 U.S. 43, 52, 114 S.Ct. 2038, 129 L.Ed.2d 36 (1994).</p>\n<p>First, Festival organizers keep sidewalks that are adjacent to Warren Avenue open for public traffic. In <i>Heffron,</i> attendees paid an admission fee to enter the fairgrounds, 452 U.S. at 658, 101 S.Ct. 2559 (Brennan, J., dissenting), which means that the fairgrounds were closed to members of the public who were not attending the fair. In fact, the Supreme Court expressly distinguished the fairgrounds in <i>Heffron</i> from a public street. 452 U.S. at 651, 101 S.Ct. 2559. In contrast, Festival organizers have intentionally maintained the public character of the sidewalks that are adjacent to the Festival attractions, keeping those sidewalks open for traffic that is unrelated to the Festival. R. 47-3 (Ex. C: Beydoun Dep. at 37) (\"We wanted to make sure that the sidewalks [a]re available, whether it's for the people attending the [F]estival or people [who a]re trying to get from one location to another to go to the businesses.\"). The sidewalks may well host more traffic during the Festival than they do on other days of the year. Nevertheless, the defendants have chosen to keep the sidewalks open for public use, showing that the interests in crowd control and public safety are not so pressing that they justify restricting normal activity that occurs on streets and sidewalks. Therefore, because Festival organizers permit public traffic on the sidewalks next to Warren Avenue, the interest in curtailing First Amendment expression on those sidewalks is not substantial.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>Second and more importantly, Festival organizers permit sidewalk vendors on the sidewalks that are adjacent to Warren Avenue, belying the significance of their interest in clear sidewalks and crowd control. The sidewalk vendors have no analog in the facts of <i>Heffron,</i> where the fair \"confin[ed] individual exhibitors to fixed locations, with the public moving to and among the booths or other attractions, using streets and open spaces provided for that purpose.\" 452 U.S. at 650, 101 S.Ct. 2559. Leafleting is less obtrusive than sidewalk tables are because \"`[t]he distribution of literature does not require that the recipient stop in order to receive the message the speaker wishes to convey; instead the recipient is free to read the message at a later time.'\" <i>Int'l Soc'y for Krishna Consciousness, Inc. v. Lee,</i> 505 U.S. 672, 690, 112 S.Ct. 2701, 120 L.Ed.2d 541 (1992) (O'Connor, J., concurring) (quoting <i>United States v. Kokinda,</i> 497 U.S. 720, 734, 110 S.Ct. 3115, 111 L.Ed.2d 571 (1990)). The defendants admitted at oral argument that leafleters have never posed any problems of public safety or breach of the peace at the Festival that could make leafleters more obtrusive than sidewalk vendors. By permitting the more obstructive sidewalk tables in the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*738</span> same place where Saieg wishes to leaflet by foot, the defendants have undercut the credibility of the asserted government interests.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>The defendants respond that an interest can be substantial even if the state does not promote it in every conceivable way. A restriction on speech can satisfy the time, place, and manner test if the restriction \"promotes a substantial government interest that would be achieved <i>less effectively</i> absent the regulation.\" <i>Ward,</i> 491 U.S. at 799, 109 S.Ct. 2746 (internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis added). This statement of the law is drawn from the requirement of narrow tailoring. Immediately after the quoted language, <i>Ward</i> clarifies that, \"[t]o be sure, this standard [for narrow tailoring] does not mean that a time, place, or manner regulation may burden substantially <i>more</i> speech than is necessary to further the government's legitimate interests.\" <i>Id.</i> (emphasis added). By analogy, even when a regulation promotes a government interest that would be achieved less effectively absent the regulation, the government's interest may still be insubstantial if the regulation burdens substantially <i>less</i> speech than is necessary to further the government's interest. <i>See </i><i>City of Ladue,</i> 512 U.S. at 51, 114 S.Ct. 2038 (\"[T]he notion that a regulation of speech may be impermissibly underinclusive is firmly grounded in basic First Amendment principles.\"); <i>Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co.,</i> 514 U.S. 476, 489, 115 S.Ct. 1585, 131 L.Ed.2d 532 (1995) (holding that a policy violates the First Amendment because \"exemptions and inconsistencies bring into question the purpose\" of the policy, even though \"the Government's interest... remains a valid goal\"); <i>Florida Star v. B.J.F.,</i> 491 U.S. 524, 540, 109 S.Ct. 2603, 105 L.Ed.2d 443 (1989) (holding that \"the facial underinclusiveness\" of the state's restriction on speech \"raises serious doubts about whether Florida is, in fact, serving ... the significant interests [that it has] invoke[d] in support\" of the policy). In this case, the nature and scale of the activities that the defendants permit on the sidewalks adjacent to Warren Avenue show that the government's asserted interests are not substantial in the context of those sidewalks.</p>\n<p>With regard to the outer perimeter, the roads and sidewalks are open for pedestrians in the same way as the sidewalks that are adjacent to Warren Avenue. Concerns about crowd control seem to be exclusively conjectural. However, Saieg focuses his argument about the outer perimeter on the question of narrow tailoring. We follow his lead and address the outer perimeter below.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. Narrow Tailoring</h2>\n<p>The leafleting restriction within the outer perimeter is not narrowly tailored to further the government's objectives. To be narrowly tailored, a regulation must not \"burden substantially more speech than is necessary to further the government's legitimate interests.\" <i>Ward,</i> 491 U.S. at 799, 109 S.Ct. 2746. Put differently, the regulation must not be \"substantially broader than necessary.\" <i>Id.</i> at 800, 109 S.Ct. 2746. \"[W]hen a content-neutral <span class=\"star-pagination\">*739</span> regulation does not entirely foreclose any means of communication, it may satisfy the tailoring requirement even though it is not the least restrictive or least intrusive means of serving the [state's] goal.\" <i>Hill,</i> 530 U.S. at 726, 120 S.Ct. 2480.</p>\n<p>The parties disagree about whether the sidewalks adjacent to the Festival and the streets and sidewalks within the outer perimeter area are \"part of\" the Festival. Consequently, the parties also disagree about whether Saieg seeks to participate <i>in</i> the Festival or to leaflet <i>near</i> the Festival, a distinction that informs their arguments about narrow tailoring. This debate is a red herring. The narrow-tailoring requirement focuses on the nexus between the regulation and the government's interest. <i>Grace,</i> 461 U.S. at 181, 103 S.Ct. 1702. The government's interests need not be coterminous with \"the Festival\" as a monolithic area, and the government may have different interests in different areas of the Festival or near the Festival. As a result, whether these locations are classified as part of \"the Festival\" does not determine whether the leafleting restriction is narrowly tailored to accomplish the government's interests.</p>\n<p>Saieg has not requested to leaflet <i>on</i> Warren Avenue. Moreover, Saieg has not disputed that the restriction on leafleting within the <i>inner</i> perimeterthe sidewalks adjacent to Warren Avenueis narrowly tailored. <i>Saieg,</i> 720 F.Supp.2d at 839 (\"Plaintiff does not mount a `narrow tailoring' challenge with respect to the enforcement of the handbilling ban in the inner perimeter.\"). As explained above, we agree with Saieg that the inner-perimeter restriction on leafleting does not further a substantial government interest, making the question of narrow tailoring irrelevant.</p>\n<p>The restriction on leafleting within the <i>outer</i> perimeter is substantially broader than necessary to further the government's interests, assuming that those interests are substantial. In reaching the opposite conclusion, the district court and the defendants correctly analyze the issue from the perspective of permitting everyone to leaflet, not only Saieg. <i>See </i><i>Heffron,</i> 452 U.S. at 653, 101 S.Ct. 2559 (\"Obviously, there would be a much larger threat to the State's interest in crowd control if all other religious, nonreligious, and noncommercial organizations could likewise move freely about the fairgrounds distributing and selling literature and soliciting funds at will.\"). The district court, however, used that perspective to magnify an unsubstantiated fear. \"[M]ere speculation about danger\" is not an adequate basis on which to justify a restriction of speech. <i>Bay Area Peace Navy v. United States,</i> 914 F.2d 1224, 1228 (9th Cir.1990); <i>see also </i><i>Turner Broad. Sys., Inc. v. Federal Communications Commission,</i> 512 U.S. 622, 664, 114 S.Ct. 2445, 129 L.Ed.2d 497 (1994) (requiring that the government \"demonstrate that the recited harms are real, not merely conjectural, and that the regulation will in fact alleviate these harms in a direct and material way\"). Although the government has an interest in crowd control, the defendants \"must do more than simply posit the existence of the disease sought to be cured.\" <i>Turner Broad. Sys., Inc.,</i> 512 U.S. at 664, 114 S.Ct. 2445 (internal quotation marks omitted); <i>see also </i><i>Klein v. City of San Clemente,</i> 584 F.3d 1196, 1202 (9th Cir.2009) (\"[M]erely invoking interests is insufficient. The government must also show that the proposed communicative activity endangers those interests.\" (internal alteration marks and quotation marks omitted)), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 130 S.Ct. 1706, 176 L.Ed.2d 183 (2010). The district court neglected these principles by concluding that throngs of people \"would <span class=\"star-pagination\">*740</span> all flock to the outer perimeter to promote their respective interests and messages,\" thereby \"extend[ing] the Festival grounds into an area that is meant to serve as a buffer zone between the Festival and the outside world.\" <i>Saieg,</i> 720 F.Supp.2d at 840. The weakness in the district court's argument is that the primary justification for the outer perimeter is to curb vehicular traffic and provide parking, not to cabin pedestrian crowds. Despite the district court's speculation, the record does not mention any existing problem of pedestrian traffic in the outer perimeter area. Saieg leaflets by foot. While his leafleting might attract pedestrian listeners who would congregate on the sidewalks, it is hard to imagine that leafleters, who would be competing with more interesting attractions on Warren Avenue, could draw crowds so large that the Festival would balloon outward. Attracting merely a few listeners on a sidewalk would not implicate a substantial governmental interest in crowd control.</p>\n<p>Beydoun's testimony mirrors the hyperbole of the district court: \"if you allowed someone to distribute literature within [the] outer area, you might as well allow the other street vendors to set up tables and start selling things in that area, too. That is the buffer between going in and going out. You [have] got to maintain a security area.\" R. 47-3 (Ex. C: Beydoun Dep. at 58). Beydoun's worry is exaggerated. Although \"[t]he justification for the [challenged rule] should not be measured by the disorder that would result from granting an exemption solely to\" the challenging party, <i>Heffron,</i> 452 U.S. at 652, 101 S.Ct. 2559, permitting everyone to leaflet in the outer perimeter area does not require the city to permit street vending or other attractions in the area defined by the outer perimeter. Instead, by invalidating the leafleting restriction, we hold only that the defendants must permit speechincluding, but not limited to, archetypical First Amendment activity such as distributing leaflets, books, or DVDs.</p>\n<p>The restriction on <i>pedestrian</i> leafleting is substantially broader than necessary to further the interest in <i>vehicular</i> traffic control and parking. In other words, the restriction is not narrowly tailored because there is \"an insufficient nexus\" between the government's asserted interest and the leafleting restriction. <i>Grace,</i> 461 U.S. at 181, 103 S.Ct. 1702.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>4. Ample Alternative Channels of Communication</h2>\n<p>We do not decide whether the restriction on leafleting leaves Saieg with ample alternative methods of communicating to his target audience. Any time, place, and manner restriction must leave open ample alternative channels by which speakers can communicate their messages, although speakers are \"not entitled to [their] best means of communication.\" <i>Phelps-Roper,</i> 539 F.3d at 372. \"An alternative is not ample if the speaker is not permitted to reach the intended audience.\" <i>Bay Area Peace Navy,</i> 914 F.2d at 1229 (internal quotation marks omitted). The requirements for a time, place, and manner restriction are conjunctive. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Watchtower Bible &amp; Tract Soc'y of New York, Inc. v. Village of Stratton,</i> 536 U.S. 150, 168-69, 122 S.Ct. 2080, 153 L.Ed.2d 205 (2002) (invalidating an ordinance that served a substantial government interest because it was not narrowly tailored without discussing whether ample alternative channels of communication existed). Thus, the leafleting restriction is unconstitutional even if it leaves open ample alternative channels of communication.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>5. Summary</h2>\n<p>Even though the leafleting restriction is content neutral and might provide ample <span class=\"star-pagination\">*741</span> alternative means of communication, the policy is not a reasonable time, place, and manner restriction. Within the inner perimeter, the restriction does not serve a substantial governmental interest, as evidenced by the defendants' willingness to permit sidewalk vendors and ordinary pedestrian traffic on the same sidewalks where they prohibited Saieg from leafleting. Within the outer perimeter area, the restriction is not narrowly tailored because the government's interest in vehicular traffic control is attenuated from concern about pedestrian crowds that pedestrian leafleting might draw.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>Saieg has requested, in the event that this court rules in his favor, \"that the decision be crafted to prevent Defendants from circumventing it by playing a game of shifting `perimeters.'\" Reply Br. at 1 n. 1. Our holding is not predicated on the boundaries of the Festival or a distinction between the inner and outer perimeters. Saieg and other members of the public may leaflet from any street or sidewalk that remains open for typical, non-Festival pedestrian traffic, even if the street or sidewalk is simultaneously used for Festival traffic. We note that, should the City's conjectural harms come to pass, the City can move to modify the injunction. <i>Deja Vu of Nashville, Inc. v. Metro. Gov't of Nashville &amp; Davidson Cnty.,</i> 466 F.3d 391, 395 (6th Cir.2006), <i>cert. denied,</i> 549 U.S. 1339, 127 S.Ct. 2088, 167 L.Ed.2d 765 (2007).</p>\n<p>In addition to declarative and injunctive relief, Saieg is entitled to nominal damages for the violation of his constitutional rights. <i>See </i><i>Carey v. Piphus,</i> 435 U.S. 247, 266, 98 S.Ct. 1042, 55 L.Ed.2d 252 (1978).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. Freedom of Association</h2>\n<p>Saieg's freedom-of-association claim lacks merit. The freedom to associate protects \"choices to enter into and maintain certain intimate human relationships\" as well as \"associat[ion] for the purpose of engaging in those activities protected by the First Amendment.\" <i>Roberts v. United States Jaycees,</i> 468 U.S. 609, 617-18, 104 S.Ct. 3244, 82 L.Ed.2d 462 (1984). Unless they promote compelling state interests, government actions violate the freedom of association when, for example, they \"seek to impose penalties or withhold benefits from individuals because of their membership in a disfavored group;. . . attempt to require disclosure of the fact of membership in a group seeking anonymity; . . . [or] try to interfere with the internal organization or affairs of the group.\" <i>Id.</i> at 622-23, 104 S.Ct. 3244 (internal citations omitted). Even though Saieg has been deprived of one outlet for his association's expression, his freedom to associate has not been abridged in any way comparable to these examples. Saieg is free to associate even at the Festival. Only leafleting, not association, has been restricted.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. Free Exercise of Religion</h2>\n<p>Saieg abandoned his free exercise claim before the district court. 720 F.Supp.2d at 841. He has not contested the waiver on appeal. Therefore, his free exercise claim is not one that we must consider. <i>Doe v. Bredesen,</i> 507 F.3d 998, 1007 (6th Cir. 2007), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 129 S.Ct. 287, 172 L.Ed.2d 210 (2008).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>E. Equal Protection</h2>\n<p>The leafleting restriction does not violate the Equal Protection Clause. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*742</span> Saieg argues that the leafleting restriction distinguishes by content between religious leaflets and commercial sidewalk tables. He relies on <i>Police Department of City of Chicago v. Mosley,</i> 408 U.S. 92, 96, 92 S.Ct. 2286, 33 L.Ed.2d 212 (1972), which held that \"[s]elective exclusions from a public forum may not be based on content alone, and may not be justified by reference to content alone.\" Unlike the restriction in <i>Mosley,</i> however, the restriction in this case does not \"describe[] permissible [speech] in terms of its subject matter.\" <i>Id.</i> at 95, 92 S.Ct. 2286. Instead, sidewalk tables are permissible according to the <i>location</i> of the organization that operates them, not the subject matter of the message that the organization conveys. <i>See supra</i> Section II.B.1. Therefore, the restriction does not violate the Equal Protection Clause.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>F. City's Liability</h2>\n<p>The City may be held liable for the restriction of Saieg's free speech rights that the leafleting restriction caused. A municipality is liable if a constitutional injury results from a policy or custom \"made by its lawmakers or by those whose edicts or acts may fairly be said to represent official policy.\" <i>Monell v. Dep't of Soc. Servs.,</i> 436 U.S. 658, 694-95, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978). In this case, the City approved the Festival \"subject to . . . the rules and regulations of the Police Department.\" R. 47-13 (Ex. M: Council Resolution). Although the AACC also wanted to prohibit leafleting, Chief Haddad described the leafleting policy as his department's policy, subject only to the approval of the city council and the mayor. R. 47-11 (Ex. K: Haddad Dep. at 95-96) (stating that \"the police department will supply the standards that must be met,\" such as the \"prohibition of individuals handing out . . . materials on the public sidewalk\"). The police department's leaf-leting policy, made with the authority that the City Council delegated to it, fairly represents official City policy. Therefore, Saieg may hold the City liable for violating his First Amendment right to free speech.</p>\n<p>However, the City is not liable for claims of selective enforcement. Because the argument portion of Saieg's appellate brief does not identify or provide citations for any instances of selective enforcement, Saieg has waived the claim. Even considering the merits of Saieg's claim, the district court properly found that the incidents of supposedly selective enforcement were not \"so widespread as to have the force of law,\" <i>Bd. of Cnty. Comm'rs of Bryan Cnty. v. Brown,</i> 520 U.S. 397, 403-04, 117 S.Ct. 1382, 137 L.Ed.2d 626 (1997), and are not actions ascribable to Chief Haddad as opposed to individual officers. 720 F.Supp.2d at 844.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The leafleting restriction is not a reasonable time, place, and manner restriction. In the inner perimeter, the restriction does not serve a substantial governmental interest. In the outer perimeter, the restriction is not narrowly tailored. The defendants therefore violated Saieg's First Amendment right to freedom of speech. Absent an injunction, Saieg will continue to suffer irreparable injury for which there is no adequate remedy at law. As a result, on the free-speech claim, we REVERSE both the district court's grant of summary judgment to the defendants and its denial of summary judgment to the plaintiffs. We AFFIRM the district court's judgment for the defendants on all other claims. We REMAND to the district court for such further proceedings as are consistent with this opinion that may be warranted, including the entry of such injunctive relief in favor of Saieg as may be appropriate in advance of the Festival scheduled for June 17-19, 2011.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*743</span> MARTHA CRAIG DAUGHTREY, Circuit Judge, dissenting.</p>\n<p>In contrast to the majority here, I am persuaded that the restrictions on leafleting imposed during the Arab International Festival did not violate the plaintiff's First Amendment right to free speech. Those restrictions constituted a reasonable time, place, and manner limitation in service of a substantial government interest, and they were sufficiently narrowly tailored to further that substantial interest, as the district court held in a thoughtful and well-documented opinion granting summary judgment to the City of Dearborn and its Chief of Police. While I would normally set out an analysis to support this conclusion, there is no reason to delay issuance of the majority's order in this expedited appeal, given that the district court has provided a masterful explanation for judgment in the defendants' favor. I therefore dissent for reasons set out in the district court's opinion and order filed on June 7, 2010.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Saieg has not requested the ability to leaflet on the street that contains Festival attractions. As a result, we do not pass judgment on whether a ban on leafleting on that street itself is constitutionally permissible.</p>\n<p>[2]  \"The government may restrict speech in a limited public forum as long as the restrictions do `not discriminate against speech on the basis of viewpoint' and are `reasonable in light of the purpose served by the forum.'\" <i>Miller v. City of Cincinnati,</i> 622 F.3d 524, 535 (6th Cir.2010) (quoting <i>Good News Club v. Milford Central Sch.,</i> 533 U.S. 98, 106-07, 121 S.Ct. 2093, 150 L.Ed.2d 151 (2001)).</p>\n<p>[3]  The district court rejected this argument because <i>Spingola</i> applied <i>Heffron</i> to a two-block fair on public streets. However, <i>Spingola</i> was an unpublished opinion that did not analyze the issue. To the extent that <i>Spingola's</i> holding runs counter to our analysis, we do not find <i>Spingola</i> persuasive.</p>\n<p>[4]  The district court's response to Saieg's argument is not persuasive. According to the district court, the Sixth Circuit rejected an argument similar to Saieg's in <i>Spingola.</i> In <i>Spingola,</i> the plaintiff \"argue[d] that the regulation does not relieve the crowding and pedestrian flow obstructions that take place during the festival regardless.\" 39 Fed.Appx. at 984. Saieg's argument goes further than saying that the regulation is not a panacea for crowd control. Saieg claims that the defendants permit one activity that seriously harms the government's supposed interest at the same time that they ban another activity that only mildly harms that same supposed interest.</p>\n<p>[5]  Although Saieg has sought to leaflet on the sidewalks adjacent to Warren Avenue and Miller Road, he has repeatedly declined to request permission to leaflet on those streets themselves. Appellant Br. at 2. Because Saieg has not raised the issue, we have no occasion to decide whether Saieg may leaflet on those streets.</p>\n\n</div>",

DAUGHTREY, J. (p. 743), delivered a separate dissenting opinion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>OPINION</h2>\n<p>KAREN NELSON MOORE, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>Each summer, Plaintiff George Saieg attends the Arab International Festival (\"Festival\") in the City of Dearborn, Michigan (\"City\"). At the Festival, Saieg leads a group of Christians whose goal is to convert Muslims to Christianity. In 2009, Dearborn police instituted a leafleting restriction for the Festival. Pursuant to the restriction, no one may leaflet from the sidewalks that are directly adjacent to the Festival attractions, or on the sidewalks and roads that surround the Festival's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*730</span> core on each side by one to five city blocks. The restriction permits leafleting at the Festival only from a stationary booth and not while walking around the Festival.</p>\n<p>Saieg sued the City of Dearborn and its Chief of Police, alleging that the leafleting restriction violated his First Amendment right to free speech, as well as his freedom to associate, his free exercise of religion, and his right to equal protection. The district court denied a temporary restraining order before the 2009 Festival and granted summary judgment to the defendants in 2010. This court granted Saieg an injunction pending appeal for the 2010 Festival, permitting Saieg to distribute leaflets from the outer sidewalks and roads, but not on the sidewalks that are directly adjacent to the Festival attractions.</p>\n<p>On the free speech claim, we REVERSE the district court's grant of summary judgment to the defendants and its denial of summary judgment to the plaintiffs. We thereby invalidate the leafleting restriction within both the inner and outer perimeters of the Festival.<sup>[1]</sup> The restriction on the sidewalks that are directly adjacent to the Festival attractions does not serve a substantial government interest. The City keeps those same sidewalks open for public traffic and permits sidewalk vendors, whose activity is more obstructive to sidewalk traffic flow than pedestrian leafleting is. Moreover, the prohibition of <i>pedestrian</i> leafleting in the outer perimeter is not narrowly tailored to the goal of isolating inner areas from <i>vehicular</i> traffic. The City can be held liable because the Chief of Police, who instituted the leafleting restriction, created official municipal policy. We AFFIRM the district court's judgment for the defendants on all other claims. We REMAND to the district court for such further proceedings as are consistent with this opinion that may be warranted.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Substantive Facts</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. The Arab International Festival</h2>\n<p>The American Arab Chamber of Commerce (\"AACC\") organizes the Festival, which is free and open to the public. Each year, over 250,000 people attend the Festival, which features carnival rides, a main stage with live entertainment, international food, merchandise sales, a tent targeted at children, and tents in which artisans and other vendors display products. In 2009, forty artisan vendors, twenty-five information tables, fourteen food vendors, and seventeen sponsor booths took part in the Festival. These attractions are all located within the \"inner perimeter\" of the Festival: the eight blocks of Warren Avenue between Hartwell Street to the west and Kingsley Street to the east, as well as one block south on Miller Road, which intersects Warren Avenue. Due to the scale of the event, officers from the Dearborn Police Department supply extensive security and support the Festival from a \"[c]ommand post trailer.\" R. 47-11 (Ex. K: Haddad dep. at 52). The resolution authorizing the Festival \"subject[s]\" the Festival to \"the rules and regulations of the Police Department.\" R. 47-13 (Ex. M: Council Resolution)</p>\n<p>Businesses located along the inner perimeter on Warren Avenue can obtain permits to display and sell their goods on the sidewalks outside their storefronts. Although the City itself issued the sidewalk <span class=\"star-pagination\">*731</span> permits prior to 2009, the City now delegates authority to issue the permits to the AACC. Businesses and organizations not located on Warren Avenue can purchase an information table. In fact, if businesses or organizations wish to distribute materials, the City's police department <i>requires</i> that the distribution occur from a \"fixed location,\" which in practice means an information table located in the street, not on the sidewalk. R. 47-8 (Ex. H: Mrowka dep. at 32). \"[H]andbilling along the sidewalks that are adjacent to the [F]estival\" is not permitted. R. 47-3 (Ex. C: Beydoun dep. 35). Police officers are expected to warn anyone who distributes leaflets and, if the person continues, to arrest the offender. Dearborn Chief of Police Ronald Haddad, who assumed his position shortly before the 2009 Festival and has prior experience with crowd control in other capacities, testified that a similar policy is in place at the Michigan State Fair. The Michigan State Fair \"will not allow you to give out a paper clip unless you're stationary and at a booth. It just makes good sense, it's a good practice[,] and it's not a standard that is applied indiscriminately[;] it's across the board.\" R. 47-11 (Ex. K: Haddad Dep. at 95). Fay Beydoun, Executive Director of the AACC, testified that the leafleting policy exists \"to make sure that the sidewalks [a]re available, whether it's for the people attending the [F]estival or people [who a]re trying to get from one location to another to go to the businesses\" along Warren Avenue. R. 47-3 (Ex. C: Beydoun Dep. at 37); <i>see also</i> R. 47-11 (Ex. K: Haddad Dep. at 18) (\"[K]nowing that it [i]s going to be a very crowded situation, we ... do our very best to keep the sidewalks flowing.\").</p>\n<p>To accommodate Festival traffic, the City barricades the roads within an \"outer perimeter\" or \"buffer zone\" that surrounds the inner perimeter. Although the outer perimeter does not contain attractions, it services the Festival by \"restrict[ing] traffic,\" R. 47-8 (Ex. H: Mrowka Dep. at 15), and \"giv[ing] [vehicular] traffic some final point to turn away from the Warren Avenue destination,\" R. 47-11 (Ex. K: Haddad Dep. at 26-27). The outer perimeter also enhances \"crowd control [leading] into the [F]estival area.\" R. 47-8 (Ex. H: Mrowka Dep. at 15). Finally, the outer perimeter includes parking for Festival attendees and vendors, as well as for displaced employees of Warren Avenue businesses and any of those businesses' patrons who are not attending the Festival. R. 47-3 (Ex. C: Beydoun Dep. at 43-44). The outer perimeter stretches one block north of Warren Avenue (Morrow Circle), one block south of Warren Avenue (Blesser Avenue), five blocks west of Hartwell Street (Schaefer Road), and four blocks east of Kingsley Street (Wyoming Avenue).</p>\n<p>The restriction on leafleting applies in the outer perimeter area as well. Beydoun explained why: \"if you allowed someone to distribute literature within [the] outer area, you might as well allow the other street vendors to set up tables and start selling things in that area, too. That is the buffer between going in and going out. You [have] to maintain a security area.\" R. 47-3 (Ex. C: Beydoun Dep. at 58).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Saieg and the Arabic Christian Perspective</h2>\n<p>Saieg founded the Arabic Christian Perspective (\"ACP\"), a now-defunct \"national ministry established for the purpose of proclaiming the Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ to Muslims. As part of its outreach efforts, ACP travel[ed] around the country attending and distributing Christian literature at festivals and mosques.\" R. 13 (Amended Compl. ¶ 9). Because the City is home to a \"big Muslim community,\" the Festival provides Saieg the opportunity to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*732</span> evangelize \"thousands of Muslims in one place.\" R. 48 (Ex. A: Saieg Dep. at 42, 44). Before each Festival, the ACP operated an annual event called \"Facing the Muslim Challenge.\" In 2009, the program featured panel discussions, workshops on \"[e]ffectively witnessing to Muslims,\" debates, door-to-door outreach, and mosque tours. R. 47-2 (Ex. B: Program). The program culminated in outreach at the Festival. At each Festival from 2004 to 2008, Saieg and 90 to 120 ACP members distributed leaflets from the public sidewalks that abut Warren Avenue.</p>\n<p>In 2009, Saieg had planned for 90 ACP members to continue the practice of leafleting while roaming the Festival. However, when Saieg shared these plans with a City police sergeant, Saieg learned that the new Chief of Police, Chief Haddad, would not permit anyone to distribute leaflets while walking around the Festival. Instead, the City provided the ACP with a booth, waiving the standard fee. The booth was poorly lit and located by carnival rides, which attracted mostly children. This problem was remedied in 2010, when the ACP's booth was lit and located \"in the central area.\" <i>Saieg v. City of Dearborn,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2540159\"><a href=\"/opinion/2540159/saieg-v-city-of-dearborn/\"><span class=\"volume\">720</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">817</span></a></span>, 834-35 (E.D.Mich.2010) (describing then-upcoming plans for the 2010 festival). Saieg also faces a more basic problem with booth-based evangelism: \"[t]he penalty of leaving Islam according to Islamic books is death,\" which makes Muslims reluctant to approach a booth that is publicly \"labeled as ... Christian.\" R. 48 (Ex. A: Saieg Dep. at 75). Saieg believes that evangelism is more effective when he can roam the Festival and speak to Muslims more discreetly. The ACP distributed 37,000 packets of religious materials in 2007 and 20,000 packets in 2008, but only 500 packets in 2009 due to the remote, fixed location. Numbers from 2010 are not in the record.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Procedural History</h2>\n<p>On June 16, 2009, Saieg and ACP sued the City and Chief Haddad for violating their First Amendment rights to free speech, free association, and free exercise of religion, in addition to violating the Equal Protection Clause. Saieg has specified that \"this is not a facial challenge\" to the leafleting restriction but \"an as-applied challenge.\" Appellant Br. at 38. Moreover, Saieg has \"at <i>no</i> time ... requested to engage in his religious activity on Warren Avenue or Miller Road,\" although he has asked to leaflet on the sidewalks that are adjacent to those roads. <i>Id.</i> at 2. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, attorney fees and costs, and nominal damages. Two days after the plaintiffs filed their complaint, the district court denied a temporary restraining order. At the 2009 Festival, the plaintiffs distributed leaflets from the inconveniently located booth.</p>\n<p>The ACP was dismissed from the case after the organization dissolved. On June 7, 2010, the district court denied Saieg's motion for summary judgment and granted summary judgment to the defendants. The district court held that the leafleting restriction was a valid time, place, and manner restriction, relying heavily on <i>Heffron v. International Society for Krishna Consciousness,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110532\"><a href=\"/opinion/110532/heffron-v-international-soc-for-krishna-consciousness-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">452</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">640</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110532\"><a href=\"/opinion/110532/heffron-v-international-soc-for-krishna-consciousness-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2559</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110532\"><a href=\"/opinion/110532/heffron-v-international-soc-for-krishna-consciousness-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">69</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">298</span></a></span> (1981), and the Sixth Circuit's application of <i>Heffron</i> in <i>Spingola v. Village of Granville,</i> 39 Fed.Appx. 978 (6th Cir.2002) (unpublished opinion). The district court reasoned that Saieg retains alternative channels of communication, even though they are not his preferred channels, because he could \"orally propagat[e] [his] religious views,\" distribute materials from a booth, and distribute materials outside of the Festival. <i>Saieg,</i> 720 F.Supp.2d at 834-35. The leafleting restriction is content neutral, said the district <span class=\"star-pagination\">*733</span> court, because permitting Warren Avenue businesses to have sidewalk sales \"favor[s], if anyone, those with space along Warren Avenue no matter who they are or what their message\" is. <i>Id.</i> at 837. The leafleting restriction serves a substantial government interest \"in ensuring the orderly flow of pedestrian traffic through the crowded Festival.\" <i>Id.</i> at 838. Finally, the district court found that the restriction is narrowly tailored because allowing everyone to distribute leaflets in the outer perimeter area would \"effectively extend the Festival grounds into an area that is meant to serve as a buffer zone between the Festival and the outside world.\" <i>Id.</i> at 840. Even though streets and sidewalks are traditionally public fora, \"[f]or three days out of the year, the streets and sidewalks of the outer perimeter ... are serving an entirely different role.\" <i>Id.</i> The district court found that Saieg had abandoned his free exercise claim, and also disposed of the freedom of association and equal protection claims. Finally, the district court found that the City was not liable under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 because there was no constitutional violation. The four instances of selective enforcement that Saieg highlighted were \"insufficient to show that selective enforcement ... was so widespread as to have the force of law,\" and Saieg had not shown that the selective enforcement stemmed from official policy. <i>Id.</i> at 844 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>Saieg appealed to the Sixth Circuit and filed an emergency motion for expedited review. On June 17, 2010, this court ruled that Saieg was likely to succeed on the merits of his claim because, although <i>Heffron</i> and <i>Spingola</i> \"may support the restriction of leaflet distribution among the crowds within the core area of the Festival, they do not appear to preclude similar activity in the `outer perimeter' or `buffer zone' leading up to the core area.\" Sixth Circuit 06/17/10 Order at 3. The panel therefore granted Saieg's motion for an injunction pending appeal, permitting Saieg \"to distribute his religious literature in the streets contained within ... the `outer perimeter' or `buffer zone,'\" but not \"within the Festival itself.\" <i>Id.</i> That order expired after the 2010 Festival. <i>Id.</i> The 16th annual Festival will be held June 17-19, 2011. <i>Arab International Festival,</i> www.americanarab.com/events-a-programs/business-development.html.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. DISCUSSION</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Standard of Review</h2>\n<p>When a district court denies a permanent injunction, we review the court's legal conclusions de novo, its factual findings for clear error, and the scope of the injunction for abuse of discretion. <i>Worldwide Basketball &amp; Sport Tours, Inc. v.

The first step is to determine whether the plaintiff's conduct is protected speech. <i>Id.</i> Saieg's conduct is clearly protected. \"`[T]he hand distribution of religious tracts is an age-old form of missionary evangelism,' <i>Murdock v.

In general, then, \"the government's ability to permissibly restrict expressive conduct\" on public streets and sidewalks \"is very limited.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>The parties disagree about whether the streets and sidewalks within the inner and outer perimeters were functioning as traditional public fora or limited public fora<sup>[2]</sup> during the Festival. <i>Compare </i><i>Parks,</i> 395 F.3d at 652 (holding that \"the streets remained a traditional public forum notwithstanding the special[, non-exclusive] permit\" that allowed a private group to operate a public Arts Festival on public streets), <i>with </i><i>Spingola,</i> 39 Fed.Appx. at 983 (holding that the \"public streets\" were \"not serving in th[eir traditional] function during the festival\"); <i>see also </i><i>Heffron,</i> 452 U.S. at 651, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110532\"><a href=\"/opinion/110532/heffron-v-international-soc-for-krishna-consciousness-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

This disagreement, however, is not germane to the free speech issue in this case.

He points to the City's practice of letting Warren Avenue storefronts erect sidewalk tables, whereas he cannot distribute materials from the same sidewalk. This argument misapprehends the criterion for who can vend from the sidewalk. The criterion is location, not content or type (commercial or noncommercial) of speech. Any entity with a storefront on Warren Avenue can set up sidewalk table, and no one without a storefront can become a sidewalk vendor. R. 47-3 (Ex. C: Beydoun Dep. at 64-65). The defendants do not inquire into whether the sidewalk <span class=\"star-pagination\">*736</span> vendor is commercial or noncommercial, and the defendants do not screen the messages that sidewalk tables convey for content.</p>\n<p>The AACC's proposal for the 2009 Festival confirms that location of the speakers, not the content of their speech, is the criterion for permitting sidewalk sales. The AACC describes \"sidewalk sales ... by merchants on Warren Ave[nue]\" as a component of the Festival, alongside the \"main stage, children's tent, vendor tents, artisan's tents,\" \"carnival,\" and \"[f]ood and entertainment.\" R. 47-5 (Ex. E: Request from AACC at 1). Moreover, the 2009 proposal names \"promot[ing] the Warren Avenue Business District\" as one of two objectives for the Festival. R. 47-5 (Ex. E: Request from AACC at 3). As a way of promoting the Warren Avenue Business District, the sidewalk tables offer a \"quid pro quo for stores negatively impacted by the Festival. In exchange for subjecting them to Festival crowds in front of their stores and closed-off streets that block regular customers' ingress and egress, the existing merchants are permitted to set up tables out front to sell their wares.\" 720 F.Supp.2d at 837.</p>\n<p>In sum, the leafleting restriction does not use location as a guise for the content of speech. Neither the leafleting restriction nor the interest that the defendants seek to promote are related to the content of the restricted speech.

In the context of the Festival's inner perimeter, the interests that the defendants have named are merely \"conjectural,\" as opposed to \"real.\" <i>Id.</i> Two activities that Festival organizers permit on sidewalks abutting Warren Avenue erode the significance of the government's interest in restricting leafleting on those same sidewalks. These activities are legally relevant because \"[e]xemptions from an otherwise legitimate regulation of a medium of speech ... may diminish the credibility of the ... rationale for restricting speech in the first place.\" <i>City of Ladue v.

In <i>Heffron,</i> attendees paid an admission fee to enter the fairgrounds, 452 U.S. at 658, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110532\"><a href=\"/opinion/110532/heffron-v-international-soc-for-krishna-consciousness-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2559</span></a></span> (Brennan, J., dissenting), which means that the fairgrounds were closed to members of the public who were not attending the fair. In fact, the Supreme Court expressly distinguished the fairgrounds in <i>Heffron</i> from a public street. 452 U.S. at 651, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110532\"><a href=\"/opinion/110532/heffron-v-international-soc-for-krishna-consciousness-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2559</span></a></span>. In contrast, Festival organizers have intentionally maintained the public character of the sidewalks that are adjacent to the Festival attractions, keeping those sidewalks open for traffic that is unrelated to the Festival. R. 47-3 (Ex. C: Beydoun Dep. at 37) (\"We wanted to make sure that the sidewalks [a]re available, whether it's for the people attending the [F]estival or people [who a]re trying to get from one location to another to go to the businesses.\"). The sidewalks may well host more traffic during the Festival than they do on other days of the year. Nevertheless, the defendants have chosen to keep the sidewalks open for public use, showing that the interests in crowd control and public safety are not so pressing that they justify restricting normal activity that occurs on streets and sidewalks. Therefore, because Festival organizers permit public traffic on the sidewalks next to Warren Avenue, the interest in curtailing First Amendment expression on those sidewalks is not substantial.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>Second and more importantly, Festival organizers permit sidewalk vendors on the sidewalks that are adjacent to Warren Avenue, belying the significance of their interest in clear sidewalks and crowd control. The sidewalk vendors have no analog in the facts of <i>Heffron,</i> where the fair \"confin[ed] individual exhibitors to fixed locations, with the public moving to and among the booths or other attractions, using streets and open spaces provided for that purpose.\" 452 U.S. at 650, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110532\"><a href=\"/opinion/110532/heffron-v-international-soc-for-krishna-consciousness-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The defendants admitted at oral argument that leafleters have never posed any problems of public safety or breach of the peace at the Festival that could make leafleters more obtrusive than sidewalk vendors. By permitting the more obstructive sidewalk tables in the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*738</span> same place where Saieg wishes to leaflet by foot, the defendants have undercut the credibility of the asserted government interests.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>The defendants respond that an interest can be substantial even if the state does not promote it in every conceivable way. A restriction on speech can satisfy the time, place, and manner test if the restriction \"promotes a substantial government interest that would be achieved <i>less effectively</i> absent the regulation.\" <i>Ward,</i> 491 U.S. at 799, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112315\"><a href=\"/opinion/112315/ward-v-rock-against-racism/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In this case, the nature and scale of the activities that the defendants permit on the sidewalks adjacent to Warren Avenue show that the government's asserted interests are not substantial in the context of those sidewalks.</p>\n<p>With regard to the outer perimeter, the roads and sidewalks are open for pedestrians in the same way as the sidewalks that are adjacent to Warren Avenue. Concerns about crowd control seem to be exclusively conjectural. However, Saieg focuses his argument about the outer perimeter on the question of narrow tailoring. We follow his lead and address the outer perimeter below.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. Narrow Tailoring</h2>\n<p>The leafleting restriction within the outer perimeter is not narrowly tailored to further the government's objectives. To be narrowly tailored, a regulation must not \"burden substantially more speech than is necessary to further the government's legitimate interests.\" <i>Ward,</i> 491 U.S. at 799, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112315\"><a href=\"/opinion/112315/ward-v-rock-against-racism/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2746</span></a></span>. \"[W]hen a content-neutral <span class=\"star-pagination\">*739</span> regulation does not entirely foreclose any means of communication, it may satisfy the tailoring requirement even though it is not the least restrictive or least intrusive means of serving the [state's] goal.\" <i>Hill,</i> 530 U.S. at 726, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118385\"><a href=\"/opinion/118385/hill-v-colorado/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2480</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>The parties disagree about whether the sidewalks adjacent to the Festival and the streets and sidewalks within the outer perimeter area are \"part of\" the Festival. Consequently, the parties also disagree about whether Saieg seeks to participate <i>in</i> the Festival or to leaflet <i>near</i> the Festival, a distinction that informs their arguments about narrow tailoring. This debate is a red herring. The narrow-tailoring requirement focuses on the nexus between the regulation and the government's interest. <i>Grace,</i> 461 U.S. at 181, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110918\"><a href=\"/opinion/110918/united-states-v-grace/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1702</span></a></span>. The government's interests need not be coterminous with \"the Festival\" as a monolithic area, and the government may have different interests in different areas of the Festival or near the Festival. As a result, whether these locations are classified as part of \"the Festival\" does not determine whether the leafleting restriction is narrowly tailored to accomplish the government's interests.</p>\n<p>Saieg has not requested to leaflet <i>on</i> Warren Avenue. Moreover, Saieg has not disputed that the restriction on leafleting within the <i>inner</i> perimeterthe sidewalks adjacent to Warren Avenueis narrowly tailored. <i>Saieg,</i> 720 F.Supp.2d at 839 (\"Plaintiff does not mount a `narrow tailoring' challenge with respect to the enforcement of the handbilling ban in the inner perimeter.\"). As explained above, we agree with Saieg that the inner-perimeter restriction on leafleting does not further a substantial government interest, making the question of narrow tailoring irrelevant.</p>\n<p>The restriction on leafleting within the <i>outer</i> perimeter is substantially broader than necessary to further the government's interests, assuming that those interests are substantial. In reaching the opposite conclusion, the district court and the defendants correctly analyze the issue from the perspective of permitting everyone to leaflet, not only Saieg. <i>See </i><i>Heffron,</i> 452 U.S. at 653, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110532\"><a href=\"/opinion/110532/heffron-v-international-soc-for-krishna-consciousness-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The district court neglected these principles by concluding that throngs of people \"would <span class=\"star-pagination\">*740</span> all flock to the outer perimeter to promote their respective interests and messages,\" thereby \"extend[ing] the Festival grounds into an area that is meant to serve as a buffer zone between the Festival and the outside world.\" <i>Saieg,</i> 720 F.Supp.2d at 840. The weakness in the district court's argument is that the primary justification for the outer perimeter is to curb vehicular traffic and provide parking, not to cabin pedestrian crowds. Despite the district court's speculation, the record does not mention any existing problem of pedestrian traffic in the outer perimeter area. Saieg leaflets by foot. While his leafleting might attract pedestrian listeners who would congregate on the sidewalks, it is hard to imagine that leafleters, who would be competing with more interesting attractions on Warren Avenue, could draw crowds so large that the Festival would balloon outward. Attracting merely a few listeners on a sidewalk would not implicate a substantial governmental interest in crowd control.</p>\n<p>Beydoun's testimony mirrors the hyperbole of the district court: \"if you allowed someone to distribute literature within [the] outer area, you might as well allow the other street vendors to set up tables and start selling things in that area, too. That is the buffer between going in and going out. You [have] got to maintain a security area.\" R. 47-3 (Ex. C: Beydoun Dep. at 58). Beydoun's worry is exaggerated. Although \"[t]he justification for the [challenged rule] should not be measured by the disorder that would result from granting an exemption solely to\" the challenging party, <i>Heffron,</i> 452 U.S. at 652, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110532\"><a href=\"/opinion/110532/heffron-v-international-soc-for-krishna-consciousness-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2559</span></a></span>, permitting everyone to leaflet in the outer perimeter area does not require the city to permit street vending or other attractions in the area defined by the outer perimeter. Instead, by invalidating the leafleting restriction, we hold only that the defendants must permit speechincluding, but not limited to, archetypical First Amendment activity such as distributing leaflets, books, or DVDs.</p>\n<p>The restriction on <i>pedestrian</i> leafleting is substantially broader than necessary to further the interest in <i>vehicular</i> traffic control and parking. In other words, the restriction is not narrowly tailored because there is \"an insufficient nexus\" between the government's asserted interest and the leafleting restriction. <i>Grace,</i> 461 U.S. at 181, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110918\"><a href=\"/opinion/110918/united-states-v-grace/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1702</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>4. Ample Alternative Channels of Communication</h2>\n<p>We do not decide whether the restriction on leafleting leaves Saieg with ample alternative methods of communicating to his target audience. Any time, place, and manner restriction must leave open ample alternative channels by which speakers can communicate their messages, although speakers are \"not entitled to [their] best means of communication.\" <i>Phelps-Roper,</i> 539 F.3d at 372. \"An alternative is not ample if the speaker is not permitted to reach the intended audience.\" <i>Bay Area Peace Navy,</i> 914 F.2d at 1229 (internal quotation marks omitted). The requirements for a time, place, and manner restriction are conjunctive. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Watchtower Bible &amp; Tract Soc'y of New York, Inc. v. Village of Stratton,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121151\"><a href=\"/opinion/121151/watchtower-bible-tract-soc-of-ny-inc-v-village-of-stratton/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">150</span></a></span>, 168-69, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121151\"><a href=\"/opinion/121151/watchtower-bible-tract-soc-of-ny-inc-v-village-of-stratton/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">205</span></a></span> (2002) (invalidating an ordinance that served a substantial government interest because it was not narrowly tailored without discussing whether ample alternative channels of communication existed). Thus, the leafleting restriction is unconstitutional even if it leaves open ample alternative channels of communication.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>5. Summary</h2>\n<p>Even though the leafleting restriction is content neutral and might provide ample <span class=\"star-pagination\">*741</span> alternative means of communication, the policy is not a reasonable time, place, and manner restriction. Within the inner perimeter, the restriction does not serve a substantial governmental interest, as evidenced by the defendants' willingness to permit sidewalk vendors and ordinary pedestrian traffic on the same sidewalks where they prohibited Saieg from leafleting. Within the outer perimeter area, the restriction is not narrowly tailored because the government's interest in vehicular traffic control is attenuated from concern about pedestrian crowds that pedestrian leafleting might draw.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>Saieg has requested, in the event that this court rules in his favor, \"that the decision be crafted to prevent Defendants from circumventing it by playing a game of shifting `perimeters.'\" Reply Br. at 1 n. 1. Our holding is not predicated on the boundaries of the Festival or a distinction between the inner and outer perimeters. Saieg and other members of the public may leaflet from any street or sidewalk that remains open for typical, non-Festival pedestrian traffic, even if the street or sidewalk is simultaneously used for Festival traffic. We note that, should the City's conjectural harms come to pass, the City can move to modify the injunction. <i>Deja Vu of Nashville, Inc. v. Metro.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">252</span></a></span> (1978).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. Freedom of Association</h2>\n<p>Saieg's freedom-of-association claim lacks merit. The freedom to associate protects \"choices to enter into and maintain certain intimate human relationships\" as well as \"associat[ion] for the purpose of engaging in those activities protected by the First Amendment.\" <i>Roberts v. United States Jaycees,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111255\"><a href=\"/opinion/111255/roberts-v-united-states-jaycees/\"><span class=\"volume\">468</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">609</span></a></span>, 617-18, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111255\"><a href=\"/opinion/111255/roberts-v-united-states-jaycees/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">462</span></a></span> (1984). Unless they promote compelling state interests, government actions violate the freedom of association when, for example, they \"seek to impose penalties or withhold benefits from individuals because of their membership in a disfavored group;. . . attempt to require disclosure of the fact of membership in a group seeking anonymity; . . . [or] try to interfere with the internal organization or affairs of the group.\" <i>Id.</i> at 622-23, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111255\"><a href=\"/opinion/111255/roberts-v-united-states-jaycees/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">3244</span></a></span> (internal citations omitted). Even though Saieg has been deprived of one outlet for his association's expression, his freedom to associate has not been abridged in any way comparable to these examples. Saieg is free to associate even at the Festival. Only leafleting, not association, has been restricted.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. Free Exercise of Religion</h2>\n<p>Saieg abandoned his free exercise claim before the district court. 720 F.Supp.2d at 841. He has not contested the waiver on appeal. Therefore, his free exercise claim is not one that we must consider. <i>Doe v. Bredesen,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1435229\"><a href=\"/opinion/1435229/doe-v-bredesen/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">998</span></a></span>, 1007 (6th Cir. 2007), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">210</span></span> (2008).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>E. Equal Protection</h2>\n<p>The leafleting restriction does not violate the Equal Protection Clause. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*742</span> Saieg argues that the leafleting restriction distinguishes by content between religious leaflets and commercial sidewalk tables. He relies on <i>Police Department of City of Chicago v. Mosley,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108597\"><a href=\"/opinion/108597/police-dept-of-chicago-v-mosley/\"><span class=\"volume\">408</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">92</span></a></span>, 96, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108597\"><a href=\"/opinion/108597/police-dept-of-chicago-v-mosley/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2286</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108597\"><a href=\"/opinion/108597/police-dept-of-chicago-v-mosley/\"><span class=\"volume\">33</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">212</span></a></span> (1972), which held that \"[s]elective exclusions from a public forum may not be based on content alone, and may not be justified by reference to content alone.\" Unlike the restriction in <i>Mosley,</i> however, the restriction in this case does not \"describe[] permissible [speech] in terms of its subject matter.\" <i>Id.</i> at 95, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108597\"><a href=\"/opinion/108597/police-dept-of-chicago-v-mosley/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2286</span></a></span>. Instead, sidewalk tables are permissible according to the <i>location</i> of the organization that operates them, not the subject matter of the message that the organization conveys. <i>See supra</i> Section II.B.1. Therefore, the restriction does not violate the Equal Protection Clause.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>F. City's Liability</h2>\n<p>The City may be held liable for the restriction of Saieg's free speech rights that the leafleting restriction caused. A municipality is liable if a constitutional injury results from a policy or custom \"made by its lawmakers or by those whose edicts or acts may fairly be said to represent official policy.\" <i>Monell v. Dep't of Soc. Servs.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109881\"><a href=\"/opinion/109881/monell-v-new-york-city-dept-of-social-servs/\"><span class=\"volume\">436</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">658</span></a></span>, 694-95, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109881\"><a href=\"/opinion/109881/monell-v-new-york-city-dept-of-social-servs/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">611</span></a></span> (1978). In this case, the City approved the Festival \"subject to . . . the rules and regulations of the Police Department.\" R. 47-13 (Ex. M: Council Resolution). Although the AACC also wanted to prohibit leafleting, Chief Haddad described the leafleting policy as his department's policy, subject only to the approval of the city council and the mayor. R. 47-11 (Ex. K: Haddad Dep. at 95-96) (stating that \"the police department will supply the standards that must be met,\" such as the \"prohibition of individuals handing out . . . materials on the public sidewalk\"). The police department's leaf-leting policy, made with the authority that the City Council delegated to it, fairly represents official City policy. Therefore, Saieg may hold the City liable for violating his First Amendment right to free speech.</p>\n<p>However, the City is not liable for claims of selective enforcement. Because the argument portion of Saieg's appellate brief does not identify or provide citations for any instances of selective enforcement, Saieg has waived the claim. Even considering the merits of Saieg's claim, the district court properly found that the incidents of supposedly selective enforcement were not \"so widespread as to have the force of law,\" <i>Bd. of Cnty. Comm'rs of Bryan Cnty. v. Brown,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118104\"><a href=\"/opinion/118104/board-of-commrs-of-bryan-cty-v-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">520</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">397</span></a></span>, 403-04, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118104\"><a href=\"/opinion/118104/board-of-commrs-of-bryan-cty-v-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The leafleting restriction is not a reasonable time, place, and manner restriction. In the inner perimeter, the restriction does not serve a substantial governmental interest. In the outer perimeter, the restriction is not narrowly tailored. The defendants therefore violated Saieg's First Amendment right to freedom of speech. Absent an injunction, Saieg will continue to suffer irreparable injury for which there is no adequate remedy at law. As a result, on the free-speech claim, we REVERSE both the district court's grant of summary judgment to the defendants and its denial of summary judgment to the plaintiffs. We AFFIRM the district court's judgment for the defendants on all other claims. We REMAND to the district court for such further proceedings as are consistent with this opinion that may be warranted, including the entry of such injunctive relief in favor of Saieg as may be appropriate in advance of the Festival scheduled for June 17-19, 2011.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*743</span> MARTHA CRAIG DAUGHTREY, Circuit Judge, dissenting.</p>\n<p>In contrast to the majority here, I am persuaded that the restrictions on leafleting imposed during the Arab International Festival did not violate the plaintiff's First Amendment right to free speech. Those restrictions constituted a reasonable time, place, and manner limitation in service of a substantial government interest, and they were sufficiently narrowly tailored to further that substantial interest, as the district court held in a thoughtful and well-documented opinion granting summary judgment to the City of Dearborn and its Chief of Police. While I would normally set out an analysis to support this conclusion, there is no reason to delay issuance of the majority's order in this expedited appeal, given that the district court has provided a masterful explanation for judgment in the defendants' favor. I therefore dissent for reasons set out in the district court's opinion and order filed on June 7, 2010.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Saieg has not requested the ability to leaflet on the street that contains Festival attractions. As a result, we do not pass judgment on whether a ban on leafleting on that street itself is constitutionally permissible.</p>\n<p>[2]  \"The government may restrict speech in a limited public forum as long as the restrictions do `not discriminate against speech on the basis of viewpoint' and are `reasonable in light of the purpose served by the forum.'\" <i>Miller v. City of Cincinnati,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"175875\"><a href=\"/opinion/175875/miller-v-city-of-cincinnati/\"><span class=\"volume\">622</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">524</span></a></span>, 535 (6th Cir.2010) (quoting <i>Good News Club v. Milford Central Sch.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118446\"><a href=\"/opinion/118446/good-news-club-v-milford-central-school/\"><span class=\"volume\">533</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">98</span></a></span>, 106-07, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118446\"><a href=\"/opinion/118446/good-news-club-v-milford-central-school/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">151</span></a></span> (2001)).</p>\n<p>[3]  The district court rejected this argument because <i>Spingola</i> applied <i>Heffron</i> to a two-block fair on public streets. However, <i>Spingola</i> was an unpublished opinion that did not analyze the issue. To the extent that <i>Spingola's</i> holding runs counter to our analysis, we do not find <i>Spingola</i> persuasive.</p>\n<p>[4]  The district court's response to Saieg's argument is not persuasive. According to the district court, the Sixth Circuit rejected an argument similar to Saieg's in <i>Spingola.</i> In <i>Spingola,</i> the plaintiff \"argue[d] that the regulation does not relieve the crowding and pedestrian flow obstructions that take place during the festival regardless.\" 39 Fed.Appx. at 984. Saieg's argument goes further than saying that the regulation is not a panacea for crowd control. Saieg claims that the defendants permit one activity that seriously harms the government's supposed interest at the same time that they ban another activity that only mildly harms that same supposed interest.</p>\n<p>[5]  Although Saieg has sought to leaflet on the sidewalks adjacent to Warren Avenue and Miller Road, he has repeatedly declined to request permission to leaflet on those streets themselves. Appellant Br. at 2. Because Saieg has not raised the issue, we have no occasion to decide whether Saieg may leaflet on those streets.</p>\n\n</div>",
