Defendant Martino Moore, a four-time convicted\nfelon, possessed a firearm one night in 2007. That event carried with it serious\n\n\n        *\n        The Honorable Amul R. Thapar, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of\nKentucky, sitting by designation.\n\n\n                                              1\n\fNo. 09-5935          United States v. Moore                                                 Page 2\n\n\nramifications. It meant as an Armed Career Criminal he was subject to a mandatory\nminimum penalty of 180 months’ imprisonment. Moore argues on appeal that the\nimposition of this mandatory minimum sentence, as applied to him, violates the Eighth\nAmendment. We disagree and thus affirm.\n\n                                                 I.\n\n        On March 9, 2007, Memphis police responded to a call about an assault. At the\nscene, police interviewed Precious Jackson. She claimed that her boyfriend Moore beat\nher, pointed a firearm at her, and threatened to kill her. Two witnesses informed the\nofficers that they had seen Moore beat Jackson and that he had a firearm. But neither\nwitness saw Moore point the gun at Jackson. The police located Moore near the scene\nwith the firearm, an AMT .22 caliber semi-automatic pistol, still in his possession. They\narrested him without incident.\n\n        Moore explained that the fight erupted when Jackson took his cell phone. He\nclaimed that he took the gun away from her during the fight, but he denied hitting or\npointing the gun at her.\n\n        On February 15, 2008, a federal grand jury in the Western District of Tennessee\nindicted Moore for being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C.\n§ 922(g). Moore’s attorney requested that Moore undergo a competency evaluation. On\nJune 3, 2008, doctors at the Federal Medical Center in Kentucky diagnosed Moore with\nmild mental retardation1 but concluded that he was nevertheless competent to stand trial.\nThe doctors found that Moore had a factual and rational understanding of the\nproceedings against him and retained the ability to consult with his attorney. Moore did\nnot challenge these findings and later pleaded guilty under a written plea agreement.\n\n        Moore’s Presentence Report listed two violent felonies and two serious drug\nfelonies: (1) a 1994 conviction for aggravated burglary; (2) a 1997 conviction for\ncriminal attempt to commit aggravated burglary; (3) a 2000 conviction for possession\n\n\n        1\n          Like the briefs and doctors, we use the term “mental retardation” in order to be medically\nprecise. We mean no disrespect by using the term.\n\fNo. 09-5935         United States v. Moore                                           Page 3\n\n\nof crack cocaine with intent to manufacture, deliver, or sell; and (4) another 2000\nconviction for possession of crack cocaine with intent to manufacture, deliver, or sell.\nPSR, ¶¶ 25, 26, 28, 30. As a result, he qualified as an “Armed Career Criminal” under\nU.S.S.G. § 4B1.4(b)(3)(A) and 18 U.S.C. § 924(e). He also received a four-level\nenhancement for being a felon in possession of a firearm in connection with another\nfelony offense—aggravated assault. His guideline range was 188-235 months, with a\nstatutory minimum of 180 months under § 924(e).\n\n        Moore objected to the four-level enhancement at the sentencing hearing.\nBecause the United States could not locate Ms. Jackson to confirm whether Moore had\nin fact pointed the gun at her or hit her with the gun, it agreed that Moore’s offense level\nshould be reduced, with a new corresponding guideline range of 151-188 months. But\nunder § 924(e), the mandatory minimum sentence still stood at 180 months. Moore’s\nattorney told the court that he knew of no grounds permitting the court to go below the\n180-month minimum. The district court judge remarked that, if he had the authority to\ndo so, he would consider imposing a sentence below the statutory minimum due to the\ncircumstances of the offense and Moore’s mental deficiencies. R. 49 at 32. He\nnevertheless acknowledged that he did not possess that authority and proceeded to\nsentence Moore to 180 months’ imprisonment. Moore filed a timely appeal.\n\n                                             II.\n\n        Moore argues that his mandated minimum sentence of fifteen years’\nimprisonment violates the Eighth Amendment’s ban on cruel and unusual punishment.\nAt the heart of his argument is the belief that a unique mitigating factor—his reduced\nculpability resulting from mental retardation—transforms an otherwise constitutional\nsentence into an unconstitutional one. In United States v. Tucker, we held that\n“[i]mposing a mandatory minimum sentence on a defendant with limited mental\ncapabilities does not violate the Eighth Amendment ban against cruel and unusual\npunishment.” 204 F. App’x 518, 521 (6th Cir. 2006). We see no reason to depart from\nTucker. Further, all of the circumstances of this case, including Moore’s mildly\n\fNo. 09-5935        United States v. Moore                                          Page 4\n\n\ndiminished mental capacity, convince us that the district court’s sentence was not grossly\ndisproportionate to the crime committed.\n\n                                            A.\n\n       As an initial matter, “[a] constitutional challenge to a sentence is a question of\nlaw and reviewed de novo.” United States v. Jones, 569 F.3d 569, 573 (6th Cir. 2009)\n(quoting United States v. Marks, 209 F.3d 577, 583 (6th Cir. 2000)). While it appears\nthat Moore may not have raised this issue below, we need not decide whether plain error\nreview is appropriate because his argument fails even under de novo review.\n\n                                            B.\n\n       The Eighth Amendment provides: “Excessive bail shall not be required, nor\nexcessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.” U.S. Const.\namend. VIII. Moore is correct that the Supreme Court has interpreted the Eighth\nAmendment to contain a “narrow proportionality principle.” Harmelin v. Michigan, 501\nU.S. 957, 996 (1991) (Kennedy, J., concurring); United States v. Layne, 324 F.3d 464,\n474 (6th Cir. 2003). But that interpretation “does not require strict proportionality\nbetween crime and sentence.” Harmelin, 501 U.S. at 1001 (Kennedy, J., concurring)\n(citing Solem v. Helm, 463 U.S. 277, 288 (1983)); see also Rummel v. Estelle, 445 U.S.\n263, 271 (1980) (Eighth Amendment “prohibits imposition of a sentence that is grossly\ndisproportionate to the severity of the crime”); Coker v. Georgia, 433 U.S. 584, 592\n(1977) (Eighth Amendment prohibits “grossly disproportionate” sentences); Weems v.\nUnited States, 217 U.S. 349, 371 (1910) (Eighth Amendment prohibits “greatly\ndisproportioned” sentences (quoting O’Neil v. Vermont, 144 U.S. 323, 340 (1892) (Field,\nJ., dissenting)). Nor does it require consideration of a defendant’s mitigating factors.\nHarmelin, 501 U.S. at 995. Rather, “only an extreme disparity between crime and\nsentence offends the Eighth Amendment.” Layne, 324 F.3d at 474 (quoting Marks, 209\nF.3d at 583).\n\n       While we have traditionally not engaged in proportionality review when the\nsentence is a term of years, see United States v. Thomas, 49 F.3d 253, 261 (6th Cir.\n\fNo. 09-5935         United States v. Moore                                           Page 5\n\n\n1995), Justice Kennedy’s concurrence in Harmelin has slightly opened the door to such\nanalysis, see United States v. Hughes, 632 F.3d 956, 960 n.2 (6th Cir. 2011). This\nanalysis begins with a comparison of the gravity of the offense and the severity of the\nsentence. Harmelin, 501 U.S. at 1005 (Kennedy, J., concurring). The comparison here\nsimply does not lead to an inference of gross disproportionality. Moore’s prior\nqualifying sentences included two violent felonies involving aggravated burglary and\ntwo involving distribution of crack cocaine. On the night of his arrest in the present\nmatter, witnesses reported seeing Moore beat his girlfriend while holding a firearm. His\nwere not victimless, nonviolent crimes. Despite all this, Moore actually received the\nminimum sentence under the statute. And “[a] sentence within the statutory maximum\nset by statute generally does not constitute ‘cruel and unusual punishment.’” Layne, 324\nF.3d at 474 (quoting Austin v. Jackson, 213 F.3d 298, 302 (6th Cir. 2000)).\n\n        Contrary to Moore’s claim, this sentence did account for his mental retardation.\nEven though the guidelines authorized a sentence up to 188 months, the statute imposed\nno such cap. See Custis v. United States, 511 U.S. 485, 487 (1994) (noting that § 924(e)\nauthorizes the imposition of a life sentence). Here, the district court sentenced him at\nthe very bottom of the guideline range, expressly noting Moore’s condition while\npronouncing his sentence. R. 49 at 31-32. But even if the district court had not taken\naccount of his mental retardation, the imposition of a mandatory sentence without\nconsidering mitigating factors does not, as Moore claims, run afoul of the Eighth\nAmendment. In Harmelin v. Michigan, the Supreme Court upheld a mandatory life\nsentence for the possession of 650 grams of cocaine even where the state court gave no\nconsideration to the defendant’s felony-free record. 501 U.S. at 995. The Court\nspecifically rejected the petitioner’s “required mitigation” claim, refusing to extend the\n“individualized capital-sentencing doctrine” to a mandatory sentence of life in prison\nwithout parole. Id. The argument for requiring consideration of the defendant’s\nmitigating factors is no stronger here.\n\n        The acknowledgment in Atkins v. Virginia that mentally retarded defendants are\n“categorically” less culpable than average criminals likewise fails to render this statutory\n\fNo. 09-5935         United States v. Moore                                         Page 6\n\n\npenalty unconstitutional. 536 U.S. 304, 316 (2002). As this Court recognized in Tucker,\nAtkins dealt specifically with the death penalty. Tucker, 204 F. App’x at 521-22. And,\nas this and many other courts have held, death is simply different. Getsy v. Mitchell, 495\nF.3d 295, 306 (6th Cir. 2007) (en banc) (“It is now also well settled that the penalty of\ndeath is different in kind from any other punishment imposed under our system of\njustice.”). The death penalty is “unique in its total irrevocability,” “its rejection of\nrehabilitation of the convict as a basic purpose of criminal justice,” and “its absolute\nrenunciation of all that is embodied in our concept of humanity.” Harmelin, 501 U.S.\nat 995-96 (quoting Furman v. Georgia, 408 U.S. 238, 306 (1972) (Stewart, J.,\nconcurring)). The same cannot be said of a statutorily-mandated sentence of fifteen\nyears.\n\n         Further, Atkins did not offer a blanket exemption from ordinary punishments to\nthe mentally handicapped or cast aside mandatory minimum sentences. Rather, the\nCourt recognized that mentally retarded defendants face a special risk of wrongful\nexecution because they may have difficulties assisting their counsel, they are often poor\nwitnesses, and their demeanor may convey an “unwarranted impression of lack of\nremorse for their crimes.” Atkins, 536 U.S. at 320-21. Also, concerns about culpability\nwere uniquely acute in the context of death. Evidence showed that mentally retarded\nindividuals often act on impulse rather than with premeditation. Id. at 318. But these\ndeficiencies did not warrant their exemption from punishment. Id. Justice Stevens’s\nintroductory line in Atkins resolved any doubt on this question: “Those mentally\nretarded persons who meet the law’s requirements for criminal responsibility should be\ntried and punished when they commit crimes.” Id. at 306.\n\n         This does not mean that a defendant’s culpability is irrelevant in non-capital\ncases. In considering whether a punishment is grossly disproportionate, culpability plays\na role. Solem, 463 U.S. at 293. For example, a murder-by-contract may be viewed more\nseriously than other types of murder. Id. at 293-94. A juvenile’s reduced culpability\nmost certainly played a role in Graham v. Florida, 130 S. Ct. 2011, 2026 (2010). And\neven here, Moore’s diminished culpability played a role in the district court’s decision\n\fNo. 09-5935        United States v. Moore                                          Page 7\n\n\nto impose the minimum penalty under the statute. Still, we cannot say Moore’s mildly\ndiminished mental capacity warrants a finding of gross disproportionality.\n\n       Fifteen years is by any measure a considerable amount of time. But while\n“[s]evere, mandatory penalties may be cruel, . . . they are not unusual in the\nconstitutional sense, having been employed in various forms throughout our Nation’s\nhistory.” Harmelin, 501 U.S. at 994-95. In general, Eighth Amendment jurisprudence\ngrants “substantial deference” to the legislatures who determine the types and limits of\npunishments. Id. at 999 (Kennedy, J., concurring). It is settled that legislatures may\ndefine criminal punishments without giving courts sentencing discretion. Id. at 1006\n(citing Chapman v. United States, 500 U.S. 453, 467 (1991)). In fact, this Court has\npreviously held that the very punishment Moore received—fifteen years under the\nArmed Career Criminal Act—withstands Eighth Amendment review as applied to the\nfacts of those cases. United States v. Warren, 973 F.2d 1304, 1311 (6th Cir. 1992);\nUnited States v. Pedigo, 879 F.2d 1315, 1320 (6th Cir. 1989). Other courts of appeals\nhave reached the same conclusion. See, e.g., United States v. Cardoza, 129 F.3d 6, 18\n(1st Cir. 1997); United States v. Presley, 52 F.3d 64, 68 (4th Cir. 1995); United States\nv. Hayes, 919 F.2d 1262, 1266 (7th Cir. 1990); United States v. Baker, 850 F.2d 1365,\n1372 (9th Cir. 1988); United States v. Reynolds, 215 F.3d 1210, 1214 (11th Cir.\n2000). And we are aware of no court of appeals decision that has struck down the\nArmed Career Criminal Act as violative of the Eighth Amendment.\n\n       Because a “threshold comparison” of the gravity of Moore’s offense and the\nseverity of his sentence does not reveal an inference of gross disproportionality, we need\nnot engage in the second step of the proportionality analysis by comparing his sentence\nwith those of offenders in this and other jurisdictions. Harmelin, 501 U.S. at 1005\n(Kennedy, J., concurring).\n\n                                            C.\n\n       Moore’s suggestion that his sentence is rendered unconstitutional by the decision\nin Graham v. Florida, 130 S. Ct. 2011, 2021 (2010), is also unavailing. The Graham\n\fNo. 09-5935         United States v. Moore                                            Page 8\n\n\nCourt’s holding was narrow: The Eighth Amendment prohibits the sentence of life\nwithout parole for juvenile offenders who do not commit homicide. Id. at 2030. In\nadopting a categorical approach, the Court drew a line exempting a specific class of\noffender (juveniles who do not commit homicide) from a specific punishment (life\nwithout the possibility of parole). But this approach does not apply in every Eighth\nAmendment challenge.\n\n        To begin, the penalty was unusually grave. Along with death sentences,\nsentences of life without the possibility of parole are unique in their severity. Id. at 2027\n(citing Harmelin, 501 U.S. at 1001). And that grave penalty carried with it unique\nconsequences for the particular defendant—a juvenile offender. Id. at 2028. His young\nage meant that he would spend longer behind bars than similar adult offenders sentenced\nto life. Id. What’s more, the penological theories underlying the imposition of life-\nwithout-parole      sentences—retribution,         deterrence,      incapacitation,     and\nrehabilitation—did not hold up as applied to Graham. Id. Such a sentence would in\nessence require the sentencing court to conclude that the juvenile offender had no\npossibility of rehabilitation. While defendants like Graham deserve to be separated from\nsociety for some time, “it does not follow that [they will] be a risk to society for the rest\nof [their lives].” Id. at 2029.\n\n        The unique concerns that prompted the Supreme Court to closely scrutinize the\nsentence in Graham are not present here. Most significantly, Moore’s fifteen-year\nsentence is vastly lighter. Unlike a juvenile non-homicide offender sentenced to life\nwithout parole, Moore will likely see the outside of a prison. He has hope for eventual\nrelease in a way that Graham did not. Also, the rehabilitation opportunities not available\nto juvenile non-homicide offenders sentenced to life without parole will be available to\nMoore. Moore can take advantage of the rehabilitative services of which the Court\nspoke in Graham. Id. at 2030.\n\n        Further, Moore is an adult. The Graham Court noted that real differences exist\nbetween juvenile and adult minds. Id. at 2026. It recognized that juveniles possess the\nability to change, with their actions less likely revealing “evidence of ‘irretrievably\n\fNo. 09-5935        United States v. Moore                                           Page 9\n\n\ndepraved character’ than . . . the actions of adults.” Id. (citing Roper, 543 U.S. at 570).\nLike a juvenile, a mentally retarded defendant may not have the same mental capabilities\nas those of a fully functioning adult. But the real concern in Graham went beyond the\nbasic differences in juvenile and adult minds. The concern was that a sentence of life\nwithout parole could not account for the possibility that the juvenile’s mind would grow\nand change over time. A term-of-years sentence such as Moore’s would not present this\nsame dilemma.\n\n       Thus, the Supreme Court’s concerns in Graham are simply not present here.\n\n                                            III.\n\n       Moore’s Eighth Amendment challenge to his sentence fails even under a de novo\nstandard of review. We therefore AFFIRM the sentence of the district court.\n\f",

They arrested him without incident.</p>\n<p>Moore explained that the fight erupted when Jackson took his cell phone. He claimed that he took the gun away from her during the fight, but he denied hitting or pointing the gun at her.</p>\n<p>On February 15, 2008, a federal grand jury in the Western District of Tennessee indicted Moore for being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g). Moore's attorney requested that Moore undergo a competency evaluation. On June 3, 2008, doctors at the Federal Medical Center in Kentucky diagnosed Moore with mild mental retardation<sup>[1]</sup> but concluded that he was nevertheless competent to stand trial. The doctors found that Moore had a factual and rational understanding of the proceedings against him and retained the ability to consult with his attorney. Moore did not challenge these findings and later pleaded guilty under a written plea agreement.</p>\n<p>Moore's Presentence Report listed two violent felonies and two serious drug felonies: (1) a 1994 conviction for aggravated burglary; (2) a 1997 conviction for criminal attempt to commit aggravated burglary; (3) a 2000 conviction for possession of crack cocaine with intent to manufacture, deliver, or sell; and (4) another 2000 conviction for possession of crack cocaine with intent to manufacture, deliver, or sell. PSR, ¶¶ 25, 26, 28, 30. As a result, he qualified as an \"Armed Career Criminal\" under U.S.S.G. § 4B1.4(b)(3)(A) and 18 U.S.C. § 924(e). He also received a four-level enhancement for being a felon in possession of a firearm in connection with another felony offenseaggravated assault. His guideline range was 188-235 months, with a statutory minimum of 180 months under § 924(e).</p>\n<p>Moore objected to the four-level enhancement at the sentencing hearing. Because the United States could not locate Ms. Jackson to confirm whether Moore had in fact pointed the gun at her or hit her with the gun, it agreed that Moore's offense level should be reduced, with a new corresponding guideline range of 151-188 months. But under § 924(e), the mandatory minimum sentence still stood at 180 months. Moore's attorney told the court that he knew of no grounds permitting the court to go below the 180-month minimum. The district court judge remarked that, if he had the authority to do so, he <span class=\"star-pagination\">*454</span> would consider imposing a sentence below the statutory minimum due to the circumstances of the offense and Moore's mental deficiencies. R. 49 at 32. He nevertheless acknowledged that he did not possess that authority and proceeded to sentence Moore to 180 months' imprisonment. Moore filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>Moore argues that his mandated minimum sentence of fifteen years' imprisonment violates the Eighth Amendment's ban on cruel and unusual punishment. At the heart of his argument is the belief that a unique mitigating factorhis reduced culpability resulting from mental retardationtransforms an otherwise constitutional sentence into an unconstitutional one. In <i>United States v. Tucker,</i> we held that \"[i]mposing a mandatory minimum sentence on a defendant with limited mental capabilities does not violate the Eighth Amendment ban against cruel and unusual punishment.\" 204 Fed.Appx. 518, 521 (6th Cir.2006). We see no reason to depart from <i>Tucker.</i> Further, all of the circumstances of this case, including Moore's mildly diminished mental capacity, convince us that the district court's sentence was not grossly disproportionate to the crime committed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A.</h2>\n<p>As an initial matter, \"[a] constitutional challenge to a sentence is a question of law and reviewed <i>de novo.</i>\" <i>United States v. Jones,</i> 569 F.3d 569, 573 (6th Cir.2009) (quoting <i>United States v. Marks,</i> 209 F.3d 577, 583 (6th Cir.2000)). While it appears that Moore may not have raised this issue below, we need not decide whether plain error review is appropriate because his argument fails even under <i>de novo</i> review.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B.</h2>\n<p>The Eighth Amendment provides: \"Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.\" U.S. Const. amend. VIII. Moore is correct that the Supreme Court has interpreted the Eighth Amendment to contain a \"narrow proportionality principle.\" <i>Harmelin v. Michigan,</i> 501 U.S. 957, 996, 111 S.Ct. 2680, 115 L.Ed.2d 836 (1991) (Kennedy, J., concurring); <i>United States v. Layne,</i> 324 F.3d 464, 474 (6th Cir.2003). But that interpretation \"does not require strict proportionality between crime and sentence.\" <i>Harmelin,</i> 501 U.S. at 1001, 111 S.Ct. 2680 (Kennedy, J., concurring) (citing <i>Solem v. Helm,</i> 463 U.S. 277, 288, 103 S.Ct. 3001, 77 L.Ed.2d 637 (1983)); <i>see also </i><i>Rummel v. Estelle,</i> 445 U.S. 263, 271, 100 S.Ct. 1133, 63 L.Ed.2d 382 (1980) (Eighth Amendment \"prohibits imposition of a sentence that is grossly disproportionate to the severity of the crime\"); <i>Coker v. Georgia,</i> 433 U.S. 584, 592, 97 S.Ct. 2861, 53 L.Ed.2d 982 (1977) (Eighth Amendment prohibits \"grossly disproportionate\" sentences); <i>Weems v. United States,</i> 217 U.S. 349, 371, 30 S.Ct. 544, 54 L.Ed. 793 (1910) (Eighth Amendment prohibits \"greatly disproportioned\" sentences) (quoting <i>O'Neil v. Vermont,</i> 144 U.S. 323, 340, 12 S.Ct. 693, 36 L.Ed. 450 (1892) (Field, J., dissenting)). Nor does it require consideration of a defendant's mitigating factors. <i>Harmelin,</i> 501 U.S. at 995, 111 S.Ct. 2680. Rather, \"only an extreme disparity between crime and sentence offends the Eighth Amendment.\" <i>Layne,</i> 324 F.3d at 474 (quoting <i>Marks,</i> 209 F.3d at 583).</p>\n<p>While we have traditionally not engaged in proportionality review when the sentence is a term of years, <i>see </i><i>United States v. Thomas,</i> 49 F.3d 253, 261 (6th Cir.1995), Justice Kennedy's concurrence <span class=\"star-pagination\">*455</span> in <i>Harmelin</i> has slightly opened the door to such analysis, <i>see </i><i>United States v. Hughes,</i> 632 F.3d 956, 960 n. 2 (6th Cir. 2011). This analysis begins with a comparison of the gravity of the offense and the severity of the sentence. <i>Harmelin,</i> 501 U.S. at 1005, 111 S.Ct. 2680 (Kennedy, J., concurring). The comparison here simply does not lead to an inference of gross disproportionality. Moore's prior qualifying sentences included two violent felonies involving aggravated burglary and two involving distribution of crack cocaine. On the night of his arrest in the present matter, witnesses reported seeing Moore beat his girlfriend while holding a firearm. His were not victimless, nonviolent crimes. Despite all this, Moore actually received the <i>minimum</i> sentence under the statute. And \"[a] sentence within the statutory maximum set by statute generally does not constitute `cruel and unusual punishment.'\" <i>Layne,</i> 324 F.3d at 474 (quoting <i>Austin v. Jackson,</i> 213 F.3d 298, 302 (6th Cir.2000)).</p>\n<p>Contrary to Moore's claim, this sentence <i>did</i> account for his mental retardation. Even though the guidelines authorized a sentence up to 188 months, the statute imposed no such cap. <i>See </i><i>Custis v. United States,</i> 511 U.S. 485, 487, 114 S.Ct. 1732, 128 L.Ed.2d 517 (1994) (noting that § 924(e) authorizes the imposition of a life sentence). Here, the district court sentenced him at the very bottom of the guideline range, expressly noting Moore's condition while pronouncing his sentence. R. 49 at 31-32. But even if the district court had not taken account of his mental retardation, the imposition of a mandatory sentence without considering mitigating factors does not, as Moore claims, run afoul of the Eighth Amendment. In <i>Harmelin v. Michigan</i><i>,</i> the Supreme Court upheld a mandatory life sentence for the possession of 650 grams of cocaine even where the state court gave no consideration to the defendant's felony-free record. 501 U.S. at 995, 111 S.Ct. 2680. The Court specifically rejected the petitioner's \"required mitigation\" claim, refusing to extend the \"individualized capital-sentencing doctrine\" to a mandatory sentence of life in prison without parole. <i>Id.</i> The argument for requiring consideration of the defendant's mitigating factors is no stronger here.</p>\n<p>The acknowledgment in <i>Atkins v. Virginia</i> that mentally retarded defendants are \"categorically\" less culpable than average criminals likewise fails to render this statutory penalty unconstitutional. 536 U.S. 304, 316, 122 S.Ct. 2242, 153 L.Ed.2d 335 (2002). As this Court recognized in <i>Tucker, Atkins</i> dealt specifically with the death penalty. <i>Tucker,</i> 204 Fed.Appx. at 521-22. And, as this and many other courts have held, death is simply different. <i>Getsy v. Mitchell,</i> 495 F.3d 295, 306 (6th Cir.2007) (en banc) (\"It is now also well settled that the penalty of death is different in kind from any other punishment imposed under our system of justice.\"). The death penalty is \"unique in its total irrevocability,\" \"its rejection of rehabilitation of the convict as a basic purpose of criminal justice,\" and \"its absolute renunciation of all that is embodied in our concept of humanity.\" <i>Harmelin,</i> 501 U.S. at 995-96, 111 S.Ct. 2680 (quoting <i>Furman v. Georgia,</i> 408 U.S. 238, 306, 92 S.Ct. 2726, 33 L.Ed.2d 346 (1972) (Stewart, J., concurring)). The same cannot be said of a statutorily-mandated sentence of fifteen years.</p>\n<p>Further, <i>Atkins</i> did not offer a blanket exemption from ordinary punishments to the mentally handicapped or cast aside mandatory minimum sentences. Rather, the Court recognized that mentally retarded defendants face a special risk of wrongful execution because they may have difficulties assisting their counsel, they are <span class=\"star-pagination\">*456</span> often poor witnesses, and their demeanor may convey an \"unwarranted impression of lack of remorse for their crimes.\" <i>Atkins,</i> 536 U.S. at 320-21, 122 S.Ct. 2242. Also, concerns about culpability were uniquely acute in the context of death. Evidence showed that mentally retarded individuals often act on impulse rather than with premeditation. <i>Id.</i> at 318, 122 S.Ct. 2242. But these deficiencies did not warrant their exemption from punishment. <i>Id.</i> Justice Stevens's introductory line in <i>Atkins</i> resolved any doubt on this question: \"Those mentally retarded persons who meet the law's requirements for criminal responsibility should be tried and punished when they commit crimes.\" <i>Id.</i> at 306, 122 S.Ct. 2242.</p>\n<p>This does not mean that a defendant's culpability is irrelevant in non-capital cases. In considering whether a punishment is grossly disproportionate, culpability plays a role. <i>Solem,</i> 463 U.S. at 293, 103 S.Ct. 3001. For example, a murder-by-contract may be viewed more seriously than other types of murder. <i>Id.</i> at 293-94, 103 S.Ct. 3001. A juvenile's reduced culpability most certainly played a role in <i>Graham v. Florida,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 130 S.Ct. 2011, 2026, 176 L.Ed.2d 825 (2010). And even here, Moore's diminished culpability played a role in the district court's decision to impose the minimum penalty under the statute. Still, we cannot say Moore's mildly diminished mental capacity warrants a finding of gross disproportionality.</p>\n<p>Fifteen years is by any measure a considerable amount of time. But while \"[s]evere, mandatory penalties may be cruel,. . . they are not unusual in the constitutional sense, having been employed in various forms throughout our Nation's history.\" <i>Harmelin,</i> 501 U.S. at 994-95, 111 S.Ct. 2680. In general, Eighth Amendment jurisprudence grants \"substantial deference\" to the legislatures who determine the types and limits of punishments. <i>Id.</i> at 999, 111 S.Ct. 2680 (Kennedy, J., concurring). It is settled that legislatures may define criminal punishments without giving courts sentencing discretion. <i>Id.</i> at 1006, 111 S.Ct. 2680 (citing <i>Chapman v. United States,</i> 500 U.S. 453, 467, 111 S.Ct. 1919, 114 L.Ed.2d 524 (1991)). In fact, this Court has previously held that the very punishment Moore receivedfifteen years under the Armed Career Criminal Actwithstands Eighth Amendment review as applied to the facts of those cases. <i>United States v. Warren,</i> 973 F.2d 1304, 1311 (6th Cir.1992); <i>United States v. Pedigo,</i> 879 F.2d 1315, 1320 (6th Cir.1989). Other courts of appeals have reached the same conclusion. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Cardoza,</i> 129 F.3d 6, 18 (1st Cir.1997); <i>United States v. Presley,</i> 52 F.3d 64, 68 (4th Cir.1995); <i>United States v. Hayes,</i> 919 F.2d 1262, 1266 (7th Cir.1990); <i>United States v. Baker,</i> 850 F.2d 1365, 1372 (9th Cir.1988); <i>United States v. Reynolds,</i> 215 F.3d 1210, 1214 (11th Cir.2000). And we are aware of no court of appeals decision that has struck down the Armed Career Criminal Act as violative of the Eighth Amendment.</p>\n<p>Because a \"threshold comparison\" of the gravity of Moore's offense and the severity of his sentence does not reveal an inference of gross disproportionality, we need not engage in the second step of the proportionality analysis by comparing his sentence with those of offenders in this and other jurisdictions. <i>Harmelin,</i> 501 U.S. at 1005, 111 S.Ct. 2680 (Kennedy, J., concurring).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C.</h2>\n<p>Moore's suggestion that his sentence is rendered unconstitutional by the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*457</span> decision in <i>Graham v. Florida,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 130 S.Ct. 2011, 2021, 176 L.Ed.2d 825 (2010), is also unavailing. The <i>Graham</i> Court's holding was narrow: The Eighth Amendment prohibits the sentence of life without parole for juvenile offenders who do not commit homicide. <i>Id.</i> at 2030. In adopting a categorical approach, the Court drew a line exempting a specific class of offender (juveniles who do not commit homicide) from a specific punishment (life without the possibility of parole). But this approach does not apply in every Eighth Amendment challenge.</p>\n<p>To begin, the penalty was unusually grave. Along with death sentences, sentences of life without the possibility of parole are unique in their severity. <i>Id.</i> at 2027 (citing <i>Harmelin,</i> 501 U.S. at 1001, 111 S.Ct. 2680). And that grave penalty carried with it unique consequences for the particular defendanta juvenile offender. <i>Id.</i> at 2028. His young age meant that he would spend longer behind bars than similar adult offenders sentenced to life. <i>Id.</i> What's more, the penological theories underlying the imposition of life-without-parole sentencesretribution, deterrence, incapacitation, and rehabilitationdid not hold up as applied to Graham. <i>Id.</i> Such a sentence would in essence require the sentencing court to conclude that the juvenile offender had no possibility of rehabilitation. While defendants like Graham deserve to be separated from society for some time, \"it does not follow that [they will] be a risk to society for the rest of [their lives].\" <i>Id.</i> at 2029.</p>\n<p>The unique concerns that prompted the Supreme Court to closely scrutinize the sentence in <i>Graham</i> are not present here. Most significantly, Moore's fifteen-year sentence is vastly lighter. Unlike a juvenile non-homicide offender sentenced to life without parole, Moore will likely see the outside of a prison. He has hope for eventual release in a way that Graham did not. Also, the rehabilitation opportunities not available to juvenile non-homicide offenders sentenced to life without parole will be available to Moore. Moore can take advantage of the rehabilitative services of which the Court spoke in <i>Graham. Id.</i> at 2030.</p>\n<p>Further, Moore is an adult. The <i>Graham</i> Court noted that real differences exist between juvenile and adult minds. <i>Id.</i> at 2026. It recognized that juveniles possess the ability to change, with their actions less likely revealing \"evidence of `irretrievably depraved character' than . . . the actions of adults.\" <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>Roper v. Simmons,</i> 543 U.S. 551, 570, 125 S.Ct. 1183, 161 L.Ed.2d 1 (2005)). Like a juvenile, a mentally retarded defendant may not have the same mental capabilities as those of a fully functioning adult. But the real concern in <i>Graham</i> went beyond the basic differences in juvenile and adult minds. The concern was that a sentence of life without parole could not account for the possibility that the juvenile's mind would grow and change over time. A term-of-years sentence such as Moore's would not present this same dilemma.</p>\n<p>Thus, the Supreme Court's concerns in <i>Graham</i> are simply not present here.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>Moore's Eighth Amendment challenge to his sentence fails even under a <i>de novo</i> standard of review. We therefore AFFIRM the sentence of the district court.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  The Honorable Amul R.

Moore argues on appeal that the imposition of this mandatory minimum sentence, as applied to him, violates the Eighth Amendment. We disagree and thus affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>On March 9, 2007, Memphis police responded to a call about an assault. At the scene, police interviewed Precious Jackson. She claimed that her boyfriend Moore beat her, pointed a firearm at her, and threatened to kill her.

This analysis begins with a comparison of the gravity of the offense and the severity of the sentence. <i>Harmelin,</i> 501 U.S. at 1005, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112646\"><a href=\"/opinion/112646/harmelin-v-michigan/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2680</span></a></span> (Kennedy, J., concurring). The comparison here simply does not lead to an inference of gross disproportionality. Moore's prior qualifying sentences included two violent felonies involving aggravated burglary and two involving distribution of crack cocaine. On the night of his arrest in the present matter, witnesses reported seeing Moore beat his girlfriend while holding a firearm. His were not victimless, nonviolent crimes. Despite all this, Moore actually received the <i>minimum</i> sentence under the statute. And \"[a] sentence within the statutory maximum set by statute generally does not constitute `cruel and unusual punishment.'\" <i>Layne,</i> 324 F.3d at 474 (quoting <i>Austin v. Jackson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"768800\"><a href=\"/opinion/768800/john-austin-v-andrew-jackson-warden-huron-valley-mens-facility/\"><span class=\"volume\">213</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">298</span></a></span>, 302 (6th Cir.2000)).</p>\n<p>Contrary to Moore's claim, this sentence <i>did</i> account for his mental retardation. Even though the guidelines authorized a sentence up to 188 months, the statute imposed no such cap. <i>See </i><i>Custis v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087955\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087955/custis-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">485</span></a></span>, 487, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087955\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087955/custis-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">517</span></a></span> (1994) (noting that § 924(e) authorizes the imposition of a life sentence). Here, the district court sentenced him at the very bottom of the guideline range, expressly noting Moore's condition while pronouncing his sentence. R. 49 at 31-32. But even if the district court had not taken account of his mental retardation, the imposition of a mandatory sentence without considering mitigating factors does not, as Moore claims, run afoul of the Eighth Amendment. In <i>Harmelin v. Michigan</i><i>,</i> the Supreme Court upheld a mandatory life sentence for the possession of 650 grams of cocaine even where the state court gave no consideration to the defendant's felony-free record. 501 U.S. at 995, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112646\"><a href=\"/opinion/112646/harmelin-v-michigan/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2680</span></a></span>. The Court specifically rejected the petitioner's \"required mitigation\" claim, refusing to extend the \"individualized capital-sentencing doctrine\" to a mandatory sentence of life in prison without parole. <i>Id.</i> The argument for requiring consideration of the defendant's mitigating factors is no stronger here.</p>\n<p>The acknowledgment in <i>Atkins v. Virginia</i> that mentally retarded defendants are \"categorically\" less culpable than average criminals likewise fails to render this statutory penalty unconstitutional. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121158\"><a href=\"/opinion/121158/atkins-v-virginia/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">304</span></a></span>, 316, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121158\"><a href=\"/opinion/121158/atkins-v-virginia/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

And, as this and many other courts have held, death is simply different. <i>Getsy v.

The death penalty is \"unique in its total irrevocability,\" \"its rejection of rehabilitation of the convict as a basic purpose of criminal justice,\" and \"its absolute renunciation of all that is embodied in our concept of humanity.\" <i>Harmelin,</i> 501 U.S. at 995-96, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112646\"><a href=\"/opinion/112646/harmelin-v-michigan/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The same cannot be said of a statutorily-mandated sentence of fifteen years.</p>\n<p>Further, <i>Atkins</i> did not offer a blanket exemption from ordinary punishments to the mentally handicapped or cast aside mandatory minimum sentences. Rather, the Court recognized that mentally retarded defendants face a special risk of wrongful execution because they may have difficulties assisting their counsel, they are <span class=\"star-pagination\">*456</span> often poor witnesses, and their demeanor may convey an \"unwarranted impression of lack of remorse for their crimes.\" <i>Atkins,</i> 536 U.S. at 320-21, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121158\"><a href=\"/opinion/121158/atkins-v-virginia/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2242</span></a></span>. Also, concerns about culpability were uniquely acute in the context of death. Evidence showed that mentally retarded individuals often act on impulse rather than with premeditation. <i>Id.</i> at 318, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121158\"><a href=\"/opinion/121158/atkins-v-virginia/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2242</span></a></span>. But these deficiencies did not warrant their exemption from punishment. <i>Id.</i> Justice Stevens's introductory line in <i>Atkins</i> resolved any doubt on this question: \"Those mentally retarded persons who meet the law's requirements for criminal responsibility should be tried and punished when they commit crimes.\" <i>Id.</i> at 306, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121158\"><a href=\"/opinion/121158/atkins-v-virginia/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2242</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>This does not mean that a defendant's culpability is irrelevant in non-capital cases. In considering whether a punishment is grossly disproportionate, culpability plays a role. <i>Solem,</i> 463 U.S. at 293, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111000\"><a href=\"/opinion/111000/solem-v-helm/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">3001</span></a></span>. For example, a murder-by-contract may be viewed more seriously than other types of murder. <i>Id.</i> at 293-94, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111000\"><a href=\"/opinion/111000/solem-v-helm/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">3001</span></a></span>. A juvenile's reduced culpability most certainly played a role in <i>Graham v. Florida,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"150543\"><a href=\"/opinion/150543/graham-v-florida/\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">825</span></a></span> (2010). And even here, Moore's diminished culpability played a role in the district court's decision to impose the minimum penalty under the statute. Still, we cannot say Moore's mildly diminished mental capacity warrants a finding of gross disproportionality.</p>\n<p>Fifteen years is by any measure a considerable amount of time. But while \"[s]evere, mandatory penalties may be cruel,. . . they are not unusual in the constitutional sense, having been employed in various forms throughout our Nation's history.\" <i>Harmelin,</i> 501 U.S. at 994-95, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112646\"><a href=\"/opinion/112646/harmelin-v-michigan/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

And we are aware of no court of appeals decision that has struck down the Armed Career Criminal Act as violative of the Eighth Amendment.</p>\n<p>Because a \"threshold comparison\" of the gravity of Moore's offense and the severity of his sentence does not reveal an inference of gross disproportionality, we need not engage in the second step of the proportionality analysis by comparing his sentence with those of offenders in this and other jurisdictions. <i>Harmelin,</i> 501 U.S. at 1005, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112646\"><a href=\"/opinion/112646/harmelin-v-michigan/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2680</span></a></span> (Kennedy, J., concurring).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C.</h2>\n<p>Moore's suggestion that his sentence is rendered unconstitutional by the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*457</span> decision in <i>Graham v. Florida,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"150543\"><a href=\"/opinion/150543/graham-v-florida/\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">825</span></a></span> (2010), is also unavailing. The <i>Graham</i> Court's holding was narrow: The Eighth Amendment prohibits the sentence of life without parole for juvenile offenders who do not commit homicide. <i>Id.</i> at 2030. In adopting a categorical approach, the Court drew a line exempting a specific class of offender (juveniles who do not commit homicide) from a specific punishment (life without the possibility of parole). But this approach does not apply in every Eighth Amendment challenge.</p>\n<p>To begin, the penalty was unusually grave. Along with death sentences, sentences of life without the possibility of parole are unique in their severity. <i>Id.</i> at 2027 (citing <i>Harmelin,</i> 501 U.S. at 1001, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112646\"><a href=\"/opinion/112646/harmelin-v-michigan/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2680</span></a></span>). And that grave penalty carried with it unique consequences for the particular defendanta juvenile offender. <i>Id.</i> at 2028. His young age meant that he would spend longer behind bars than similar adult offenders sentenced to life. <i>Id.</i> What's more, the penological theories underlying the imposition of life-without-parole sentencesretribution, deterrence, incapacitation, and rehabilitationdid not hold up as applied to Graham. <i>Id.</i> Such a sentence would in essence require the sentencing court to conclude that the juvenile offender had no possibility of rehabilitation. While defendants like Graham deserve to be separated from society for some time, \"it does not follow that [they will] be a risk to society for the rest of [their lives].\" <i>Id.</i> at 2029.</p>\n<p>The unique concerns that prompted the Supreme Court to closely scrutinize the sentence in <i>Graham</i> are not present here. Most significantly, Moore's fifteen-year sentence is vastly lighter. Unlike a juvenile non-homicide offender sentenced to life without parole, Moore will likely see the outside of a prison. He has hope for eventual release in a way that Graham did not. Also, the rehabilitation opportunities not available to juvenile non-homicide offenders sentenced to life without parole will be available to Moore. Moore can take advantage of the rehabilitative services of which the Court spoke in <i>Graham. Id.</i> at 2030.</p>\n<p>Further, Moore is an adult. The <i>Graham</i> Court noted that real differences exist between juvenile and adult minds. <i>Id.</i> at 2026. It recognized that juveniles possess the ability to change, with their actions less likely revealing \"evidence of `irretrievably depraved character' than . . . the actions of adults.\" <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>Roper v. Simmons,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"137749\"><a href=\"/opinion/137749/roper-v-simmons/\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">551</span></a></span>, 570, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"137749\"><a href=\"/opinion/137749/roper-v-simmons/\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span> (2005)). Like a juvenile, a mentally retarded defendant may not have the same mental capabilities as those of a fully functioning adult. But the real concern in <i>Graham</i> went beyond the basic differences in juvenile and adult minds. The concern was that a sentence of life without parole could not account for the possibility that the juvenile's mind would grow and change over time. A term-of-years sentence such as Moore's would not present this same dilemma.</p>\n<p>Thus, the Supreme Court's concerns in <i>Graham</i> are simply not present here.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>Moore's Eighth Amendment challenge to his sentence fails even under a <i>de novo</i> standard of review. We therefore AFFIRM the sentence of the district court.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  The Honorable Amul R.
