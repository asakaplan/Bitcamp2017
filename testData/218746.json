In this petition for a writ of mandamus, David Sutton, Jr., seeks\nan order directing the Commissioner of Social Security to exercise his discretion to\nreopen proceedings and reinstate a 1985 decision that awarded him disability benefits.\nThe Commissioner has responded that Sutton is barred by the doctrine of res judicata\nand, alternatively, that Sutton’s petition should fail on the merits. Neither of these\narguments needs to be addressed, however, because the petition is not properly before\nthis court.\n\n        Sutton was awarded disability insurance benefits for a period beginning in June\n1983. In 2002, however, the Social Security Administration produced evidence that\nSutton had engaged in substantial gainful employment during the years that Sutton\nclaimed to have been disabled. The Appeals Council accordingly reopened the\n\n\n\n        *\n        The Honorable Karl S.

Sutton sought judicial review. The district court\naffirmed. Sutton v. Comm’r of Soc. Sec., No. 2:05-cv-70207 (E.D. Mich. Jul. 24, 2006).\nOn appeal, this court affirmed. Sutton v. Comm’r of Soc. Sec., No. 06-2100 (6th Cir.\nMar. 22, 2007) (order).\n\n       Sutton then sought supplemental security income benefits. His application was\ndenied, and on his request for judicial review, the district court affirmed. Sutton v.\nComm’r of Soc. Sec., No. 2:08-cv-13182 (E.D. Mich. Sept. 25, 2009). On appeal, this\ncourt affirmed. Sutton v. Comm’r of Soc. Sec., No. 09-2288 (6th Cir. Apr. 5, 2011)\n(order).\n\n       Sutton now petitions for a writ of mandamus, asking this court to order the\nCommissioner of Social Security to reinstate Sutton’s disability benefits. The court of\nappeals lacks jurisdiction to issue a writ of mandamus directly to the Commissioner of\nSocial Security.\n\n       Direct review of agency action has been placed in the courts of appeals only on\nan agency-by-agency basis in the particular organic acts of selected agencies. So-called\n“nonstatutory” judicial review, based on the Administrative Procedure Act and a general\ngrant of jurisdiction such as 28 U.S.C. § 1331, when available, is in the district court.\nSee Note, Jurisdiction to Review Federal Administrative Action: District Court or Court\nof Appeals, 88 Harv. L. Rev. 980, 981 (1975).\n\n       Moreover, in the case of Social Security Act cases, judicial review is in the\ndistrict court and is exclusively through 42 U.S.C. § 405(g). Shalala v. Illinois Council\non Long Term Care, Inc., 529 U.S. 1, 10 (2000); Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 327\n(1976); Weinberger v. Salfi, 422 U.S. 749, 757 (1975). Other district court jurisdictional\nbases are explicitly precluded in 42 U.S.C. § 405(h). The Supreme Court has reserved\nwithout deciding whether a district court would ever have jurisdiction to review a\ndecision of the Commissioner under the district court mandamus statute, 28 U.S.C.\n\fNo. 11-1511            In re David Sutton, Jr.                                                     Page 3\n\n\n§ 1361, in light of 42 U.S.C. § 405(h).1 In any event, §1361 obviously does not give any\nmandamus jurisdiction to appellate courts.\n\n         To be sure, this court has jurisdiction under the All Writs Act to issue writs,\nincluding writs of mandamus, in aid of our jurisdiction. 28 U.S.C. § 1651. Thus we may\nissue a writ of mandamus to a lower court in appropriate circumstances. See In re\nChimenti, 79 F.3d 534, 540 (6th Cir. 1996); McClellan v. Young, 421 F.2d 690, 691 (6th\nCir. 1970). Such writs are in aid of our appellate jurisdiction. See Blay v. Young, 509\nF.2d 650, 651 (6th Cir. 2004). A mandamus directed at a federal official in a suit\nbrought directly in our court, in contrast, would be an exercise of original jurisdiction,\nas explained in Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 175 (1803). We lack such\njurisdiction in the Social Security context.\n\n         The petition for a writ of mandamus is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.\n\n\n\n\n         1\n          While several circuits have allowed for mandamus jurisdiction in social security cases, see, e.g.,\nRandall D.
