This matter is before the court upon consideration of Jose Angel\nGaytan-Garza’s response to this court’s order directing him to show cause why his\nappeal should not be dismissed on the basis of a late notice of appeal. The district court\nentered Gaytan-Garza’s judgment of conviction on June 14, 2006. Gaytan-Garza filed\nhis notice of appeal on December 6, 2010, over four years late. Dismissal is proper in\nthis case under Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure 4(b) and 26(a).\n\n        In his response to the show-cause order, Gaytan-Garza implicitly recognizes this\ncourt’s established position that the time period set forth in Rule 4(b) is “jurisdictional.”\nSee United States v. Dotz, 455 F.3d 644, 647 (6th Cir. 2006). However, he argues that\n“the failure to file the Notice of Appeal is no longer a jurisdictional defect precluding\nthis court from retaining jurisdiction,” in light of United States v. Martinez, 496 F.3d\n\n\n        *\n        The Honorable Karl S. Forester, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of\nKentucky, sitting by designation.\n\n\n                                               1\n\fNo. 10-4615        United States v. Gaytan-Garza                                    Page 2\n\n\n387, 388-89 (5th Cir. 2007). Although Martinez is not binding on this court, its\nconclusion that Rule 4(b) is not jurisdictional is based on clear Supreme Court precedent\nthat undermines our prior understanding of the rule. Three Supreme Court decisions\nhave explained that a jurisdictional time period is established by statute and that a time\nperiod established only by a rule is merely a non-jurisdictional claim-processing rule.\nBowles v. Russell, 551 U.S. 205, 210-13 (2007), held that the time period set forth in\nFederal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(6) is jurisdictional based on 28 U.S.C.\n§ 2107(c). Eberhart v. United States, 546 U.S. 12, 15-16 (2005), held that the time\nperiod provided for filing a Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33 motion for a new trial\nis not jurisdictional, but a claim-processing rule. Kontrick v. Ryan, 540 U.S. 443, 454\n(2004), held that the time period provided by Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure\n4004 is not jurisdictional, but a claim-processing rule.\n\n       Rule 4(b), unlike Rule 4(a), is not established by statute, and it is now clear that\nRule 4(b) is not jurisdictional. This is consistent with the holdings and reasoning of\nseveral of our sister circuits. See United States v. Watson, 623 F.3d 542, 544 (8th Cir.\n2010); Virgin Islands v. Martinez, 620 F.3d 321, 327-28 (3d Cir. 2010); United States\nv. Neff, 598 F.3d 320, 323 (7th Cir. 2010); United States v. Urutyan, 564 F.3d 679, 685\n(4th Cir. 2009); United States v. Lopez, 562 F.3d 1309, 1311-13 (11th Cir. 2009); United\nStates v. Byfield, 522 F.3d 400, 403 n.2 (D.C. Cir. 2008); United States v. Frias, 521\nF.3d 229, 232-34 (2d Cir. 2008); United States v. Garduno, 506 F.3d 1287, 1291 (10th\nCir. 2007); Martinez, 496 F.3d at 388-89; United States v. Sadler, 480 F.3d 932, 939-40\n(9th Cir. 2007). Therefore, we are not required to dismiss late-filed criminal appeals\nunless the government has raised the issue, which it can do by motion or in its briefing.\nSee Byfield, 522 F.3d at 403; Garduno, 506 F.3d at 1292 n.7.\n\n       While we are not required to dismiss as a jurisdictional matter, this holding does\nnot preclude sua sponte dismissal of late-filed criminal appeals. See United States v.\nMitchell, 518 F.3d 740, 751 (10th Cir. 2008); Fed. R. App. P. 26(b)(1). Such dismissal\nis appropriate here, as Gaytan-Garza’s delay of over four years in filing his appeal\n\fNo. 10-4615       United States v. Gaytan-Garza                              Page 3\n\n\nimplicates the important judicial interests of finality of convictions and efficient\nadministration of claim processing.\n\n       The appeal is dismissed as untimely.\n\f",
