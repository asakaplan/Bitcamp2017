Federal prisoner Darrell Walker challenges the\nsubstantive reasonableness of his thirty-six-month sentence for escape. Finding that the\ndistrict court impermissibly lengthened Walker’s sentence to promote his rehabilitation,\nwe vacate his sentence and remand for resentencing.\n\n\n\n\n                                           1\n\fNo. 09-6498        United States v. Walker                                           Page 2\n\n\n                                             I.\n\n       Walker’s history of chronic drug abuse and mental illness has resulted in\nnumerous criminal charges.      His current conviction stems from an escape from\nsupervised release, an action he partially attributes to issues with his medication. The\ndistrict court summarized the uncontroverted facts surrounding the offense:\n\n               On or about September 15,[] 2005, Darrell Walker was sentenced\n       by United States District Judge R. Allen Edgar to a term of 36 months for\n       two felonious counts of credit card fraud . . . . On or about January 23,\n       2009, Walker was assigned to the Salvation Army Halfway House in\n       Chattanooga, Tennessee. While at the Salvation Army Halfway House\n       in Chattanooga, Tennessee, Walker was lawfully confined at the\n       direction of the Attorney General and thereby remained in the custody of\n       the Attorney General by virtue of the above described felony convictions.\n       On or about January 29, 2009,Walker signed himself out of the Salvation\n       Army Halfway House in Chattanooga, Tennessee and knowingly and\n       willfully failed to return by 5:00 p[.]m. Walker’s failure to return by\n       5:00 p.m. was a willful failure to remain within the extended limits of his\n       confinement and constituted an escape. Walker wil[l]fully remained\n       outside the extended limits of his confinement until he was apprehended\n       on February 19, 2009.\n\nOnce in custody, Walker pleaded guilty without the benefit of a plea agreement.\n\n       Walker’s presentence investigation report started with a base offense level of\nthirteen, but applied two reductions—four levels for escape from non-secure custody and\ntwo levels for acceptance of responsibility—to arrive at a total offense level of seven.\nHis twenty-three criminal history points yielded a criminal history score of VI.\nTogether, these figures gave rise to an advisory guidelines range of fifteen to twenty-one\nmonths’ imprisonment.\n\n       Prior to sentencing, Walker moved for an additional downward departure or\nvariance, citing his diminished mental capacity and cooperation with law enforcement.\nThe court, however, noted that it was considering an above-guidelines sentence in light\nof Walker’s record (which included twenty-nine prior convictions—all but two for drug-\nrelated offenses), the nature of the offense, and Walker’s need for drug treatment\nspanning longer than the guidelines’ recommended sentence. During its colloquy, the\n\fNo. 09-6498        United States v. Walker                                         Page 3\n\n\ncourt reasoned that a longer incarceration would best serve both Walker and society by\nensuring that he received “the benefit of all that the government can offer” in terms of\ntreatment. Following this explanation, the court announced a thirty-six-month sentence.\nWalker now appeals.\n\n                                             II.\n\n       We review a district court’s sentencing decision under a two-part test, ensuring\nfirst “that the district court committed no significant procedural error,” and second that\nthe sentence imposed was substantively reasonable. Gall v. United States, 552 U.S. 38,\n51 (2007); see also United States v. Webb, 403 F.3d 373, 385 (6th Cir. 2005) (providing\nexamples of substantive unreasonableness such as “selecting the sentence arbitrarily,\nbasing the sentence on impermissible factors, failing to consider pertinent § 3553(a)\nfactors, or giving an unreasonable amount of weight to any pertinent factor” (footnote\nomitted)). Neither party raises procedural challenges, and our own parsing of the\nsentencing-hearing transcript reveals no evidence of such error. We therefore move\ndirectly to substantive reasonableness, which we review “under a deferential abuse-of-\ndiscretion standard.” Gall, 552 U.S. at 41.\n\n       Walker attacks his sentence on two grounds: first, the sentence “is greater than\nnecessary to fulfill the requirements of 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a),” and second, the court\nimproperly rooted its upward variance in concerns for Walker’s psychiatric and\nrehabilitative needs.\n\n       We reject Walker’s first argument, which conflates the district court’s sentencing\nmandate with the appellate court’s scope of review. While § 3553(a) requires that the\ndistrict court “impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary” to comply\nwith its purposes, 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a), “[r]easonableness[—not parsimony—]is the\nstandard appellate courts use to evaluate the district court’s accomplishment of its\nsentencing task,” United States v. Bolds, 511 F.3d 568, 578 (6th Cir. 2007). “The fact\nthat the district court did not give the defendant the exact sentence he sought is not a\ncognizable basis to appeal, particularly where the district court followed the mandate of\n§ 3553(a) in all relevant respects.” United States v. Dexta, 470 F.3d 612, 616 (6th Cir.\n\fNo. 09-6498         United States v. Walker                                      Page 4\n\n\n2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); see also United States v. Trejo-\nMartinez, 481 F.3d 409, 413 (6th Cir. 2007) (“The mere fact that [a defendant] desired\na more lenient sentence, without more, is insufficient to justify our disturbing the\nreasoned judgment of the district court.”). Walker’s primary contention thus provides\nno independent grounds upon which to dispute the reasonableness of his sentence on\nappeal.\n\n          We move to Walker’s second challenge—that, in deciding to sentence above the\nguidelines, the court improperly relied upon Walker’s need for rehabilitation and\npsychiatric treatment. Although § 3553(a)(2)(D) requires that sentencing courts consider\na defendant’s need for “educational or vocational training, medical care, or other\ncorrectional treatment,” § 3582(a) cautions “that imprisonment is not an appropriate\nmeans of promoting correction and rehabilitation.” The Supreme Court recently\nresolved any potential conflict between these provisions, holding that “a court may not\nimpose or lengthen a prison sentence to enable an offender to complete a treatment\nprogram or otherwise promote rehabilitation.” Tapia v. United States, No. 10-5400,\n2011 WL 2369395, at *9 (June 16, 2011) (emphasis added). And, upon reviewing\nWalker’s sentencing transcript, we find that the court did precisely what Tapia forbids.\nIn light of this intervening precedent, we conclude that the district court “bas[ed] the\nsentence on impermissible factors,” see Webb, 403 F.3d at 385, thus rendering its\ndecision substantively unreasonable.\n\n                                              III.\n\n          We accordingly vacate Walker’s sentence and remand his case for resentencing\nconsistent with this opinion.\n\f",

Walker's primary contention thus provides no independent grounds upon which to dispute the reasonableness of his sentence on appeal.</p>\n<p>We move to Walker's second challengethat, in deciding to sentence above the guidelines, the court improperly relied upon Walker's need for rehabilitation and psychiatric treatment. Although § 3553(a)(2)(D) requires that sentencing courts consider a defendant's need for \"educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment,\" § 3582(a) cautions \"that imprisonment is not an appropriate means of promoting correction and rehabilitation.\" The Supreme Court recently resolved any potential conflict between these provisions, holding that \"a court may not <i>impose or lengthen</i> a prison sentence to enable an offender to complete a treatment program or otherwise promote rehabilitation.\" <i>Tapia v. United States,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"218921\"><a href=\"/opinion/218921/tapia-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">131</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">357</span></a></span> (2011) (emphasis added). And, upon reviewing Walker's sentencing transcript, we find that the court did precisely what <i>Tapia</i> forbids. In light of this intervening precedent, we conclude that the district court <span class=\"star-pagination\">*514</span> \"bas[ed] the sentence on impermissible factors,\" <i>see </i><i>Webb,</i> 403 F.3d at 385, thus rendering its decision substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>We accordingly vacate Walker's sentence and remand his case for resentencing consistent with this opinion.</p>\n</div>",
