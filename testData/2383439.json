Goff elaborates in his petition that <i>Beck v. Alabama,</i> 447 U.S. 625, 100 S.Ct. 2382, 65 L.Ed.2d 392 (1980), outlaws the type of jury instruction before us in this case. Where the petitioner's reasoning attacks the same jury instructions on similar constitutional grounds, I would not hold that the argument presented in a petition to rehear has been waived or procedurally defaulted in a death penalty case. The Court's ruling means that Goff has not been allowed to present his <i>Beck</i> argument and will be executed without allowing its presentation and consideration by any court. It may be that in other types of cases this might not make too much of a difference; but I believe strongly, as pointed out in many cases, that \"death is different.\" I would not cut off this man's right to present his argument now.</p>\n</div>",
