MAYS, JR., District Judge. Defendant Metropolitan Government\nof Nashville and Davidson County, Tennessee (“Metropolitan Government”) and\nindividual Defendants Rod Manuel, Fran Perry, Mary Chambers, Alvin Jones, and Ralph\nThompson (“Individual Defendants”) (collectively, “Defendants”) appeal the order of\nthe district court denying their motions to dismiss Plaintiff Christian Heyne’s (“Heyne”)\nAmended Complaint. In the Amended Complaint, Heyne seeks relief under 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1983, alleging that Defendants violated his right to procedural due process and equal\nprotection when he was suspended from his high school for ten days. For the following\nreasons, we AFFIRM IN PART and REVERSE IN PART the district court’s order.\n\n\n\n\n        *\n        The Honorable Samuel H. Mays, Jr., United States District Judge for the Western District of\nTennessee, sitting by designation.\n\fNos. 09-6383/6464                 Heyne, et al. v. Metropolitan Nashville                   Page 3\n                                  Public Schools, et al.\n\n\n                                                 I.\n\n        This dispute stems from Heyne’s dissatisfaction with a ten-day suspension he\nreceived from Defendant Metropolitan Nashville Public Schools (“MNPS”).1 Heyne,\na Caucasian, was a senior at Hillsboro High School (“Hillsboro”) in Nashville,\nTennessee, and played on Hillsboro’s football team. On Friday, September 5, 2008,\nafter football practice, Heyne and other players congregated in the narrow parking lot\nbehind the locker room without adult supervision. D.A., an African-American student\nwho played on the football team, stood with other players in the road leading to the exit\nfrom the parking lot. Heyne got into his car and drove along the road toward the exit.\nAll of the students standing in the road except D.A. moved out of the way as Heyne\napproached. Heyne believed D.A. was standing far enough to the side of the road to\nallow him to continue driving. As Heyne approached the exit, the left front tire of his\ncar made contact with D.A.’s foot, causing D.A. to fall backward and suffer, at most, a\nbruised or sprained ankle. Heyne put his car in reverse, got out, and apologized to D.A.\nIn response, D.A. threatened to kill him.\n\n        The MNPS Code of Conduct (“Code of Conduct”) governs student conduct and\ndiscipline at Hillsboro. MNPS maintains statistics on student discipline, including the\nrace of students subject to discipline. Before the incident between Heyne and D.A., Rod\nManuel (“Manuel”), the Principal at Hillsboro, had instructed the staff at a meeting to\nbe more lenient in enforcing the Code of Conduct against African-American students\nbecause too many African-American students were serving in-school suspensions.\n\n        After the incident, D.A. and some of his friends immediately walked to Manuel’s\noffice to report what had happened. After meeting with D.A. and his friends, Manuel\ndid not meet with any other witnesses and did not visit the scene of the incident.\nAlthough the Code of Conduct prohibits threats by students, Manuel did not discipline\nD.A. for threatening Heyne’s life. Soon afterward, D.A.’s parents threatened to sue\n\n\n        1\n           The following fact summary is based on the allegations of the Amended Complaint, which we\naccept as true in reviewing the district court’s ruling on Defendants’ motions to dismiss.\n\fNos. 09-6383/6464              Heyne, et al. v. Metropolitan Nashville          Page 4\n                               Public Schools, et al.\n\n\nHillsboro and demanded compensation from Heyne, his parents, and their insurance\ncarrier. At some point, Manuel admitted that he decided to suspend Heyne to “cover”\nhimself and Hillsboro, presumably from liability for the incident.\n\n       Heyne returned to school on Monday, September 8, 2008. His only restriction\nwas that he was not permitted to operate a car on campus. On the afternoon of Tuesday,\nSeptember 9, Manuel charged Heyne with reckless endangerment under the Code of\nConduct and summarily suspended him for two days. Fran Perry (“Perry”), the\nDiscipline Coordinator for MNPS, and Alvin Jones            (“Jones”), the Director of\nAttendance and Discipline for MNPS, allegedly directed Manuel to suspend Heyne. On\nThursday, September 11, Manuel, allegedly at the direction of Perry and Jones, charged\nHeyne with two additional Code of Conduct violations, using an object in an assaultive\nmanner and cruelty to a student, increased his suspension to ten days, and referred the\nmatter to the Disciplinary Hearing Board of MNPS. The Amended Complaint does not\nstate whether, before suspending Heyne initially for two days or increasing his\nsuspension to ten days, Manuel explained the evidence against Heyne or offered him the\nopportunity to present his side of the story.\n\n       Before the hearing, Heyne submitted written materials, including witness\nstatements, for consideration by the Disciplinary Hearing Board. Those materials were\nnot provided to Disciplinary Hearing Board panelists until they arrived at the hearing.\nIn the notice of the hearing, MNPS implied that Heyne could be represented by an\nattorney at the proceeding if he followed certain steps, and Heyne hired an attorney.\nNevertheless, Perry informed Heyne’s attorney immediately before the hearing that he\ncould not participate beyond passing notes to Heyne and his parents. Heyne was not\nallowed to present witnesses on his own behalf, although several MNPS employees had\nplanned to testify for him. They were informed by Manuel that they would lose their\njobs if they attended the hearing. The Amended Complaint does not state whether they\nattended.\n\fNos. 09-6383/6464            Heyne, et al. v. Metropolitan Nashville           Page 5\n                             Public Schools, et al.\n\n\n       The Disciplinary Hearing Board met on September 23, 2008, to review the\ncharges against Heyne.     By then, he had served his ten-day suspension.       Perry\nparticipated in the Disciplinary Hearing Board’s deliberations, which were closed to\nHeyne, his parents, and his attorney. Perry was not a member of the Disciplinary\nHearing Board, and the Code of Conduct provides that non-members cannot attend the\nBoard’s deliberations. The Disciplinary Hearing Board sustained the charge of reckless\nendangerment against Heyne and affirmed his suspension for ten days, allowing it to\nremain part of his permanent school record. Before affirming that charge, the Board\nrefused to allow Heyne’s counsel to explain the elements of reckless endangerment. The\ncharges for using an object in an assaultive manner and cruelty to a student were\ndismissed. At some point during the hearing, the Disciplinary Hearing Board stated on\nthe record that Heyne did not intend to hit D.A. and did not intend any act of cruelty\ntoward a fellow student.\n\n       The Code of Conduct allowed Heyne to appeal the Disciplinary Hearing Board’s\ndecision to the Director of MNPS, and he did so. The Code of Conduct permitted the\nDirector of MNPS to delegate responsibility for deciding appeals. Chris Henson, the\nInterim Director of MNPS, designated Mary Chambers (“Chambers”), an employee in\nthe Disciplinary Office of MNPS, to hear Heyne’s appeal. Chambers worked in the\nsame chain of command as Perry. In deciding Heyne’s appeal, Chambers refused to\nconsider an affidavit submitted on Heyne’s behalf by the Hillsboro football team’s\northopedic physician stating that D.A.’s injuries were minor and that Heyne had not\nendangered D.A. Chambers consulted with Ralph Thompson (“Thompson”), the\nAssistant Superintendent for Student Services for MNPS, Perry, Manuel, and an attorney\nfor MNPS. Chambers ultimately denied the appeal. Pursuant to the Code of Conduct,\nHeyne appealed to the MNPS Board of Public Education, which had discretion to hear\nhis appeal. The Board declined Heyne’s request for a hearing and affirmed the\nsuspension.\n\n       Heyne graduated from Hillsboro in 2009. Before his suspension, several college\nrecruiters had approached him about playing football on scholarship, and Congressman\n\fNos. 09-6383/6464              Heyne, et al. v. Metropolitan Nashville              Page 6\n                               Public Schools, et al.\n\n\nJim Cooper had offered him a congressional appointment, the first step required to attend\none of the United States military service academies. Because of the suspension, Heyne\nallegedly lost the opportunity to receive a scholarship because he missed two football\ngames and his suspension was listed on his permanent school record. He also allegedly\nlost the opportunity to apply to the United States military service academies.\n\n       On September 4, 2009, Heyne filed a complaint against MNPS, Manuel, Perry,\nChambers, Jones, and Thompson in the Chancery Court of Tennessee for the 20th\nJudicial District at Nashville, Tennessee. Heyne amended his Complaint on September\n10, 2009, adding the Metropolitan Government and the MNPS Board of Public\nEducation as defendants. In the Amended Complaint, Heyne sought relief under\n42 U.S.C. § 1983 for (1) procedural due process violations by Defendants,\n(2) substantive due process violations by Defendants, (3) equal protection violations by\nDefendants, and (4) failure to train and supervise by the Metropolitan Government.\nHeyne also sought relief for state law negligence. Defendants subsequently removed the\ncase to the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee under\n28 U.S.C. § 1441. The Individual Defendants, the Metropolitan Government, and the\nMetropolitan Board of Public Education filed motions to dismiss. The district court\ngranted their motions in part and dismissed Heyne’s claims for substantive due process\nviolations, failure to train, and negligence. The district court also dismissed Heyne’s\nparents’ claims, his claims against Individual Defendants in their official capacities, and\nhis claims against MNPS and the Metropolitan Board of Public Education.\n\n       The Metropolitan Government and the Individual Defendants appeal the district\ncourt’s conclusions on the remaining parts of their motions to dismiss. The Individual\nDefendants assert that Heyne failed to state a § 1983 claim on which relief can be\ngranted because they are entitled to qualified immunity. The Metropolitan Government\nasserts that Heyne has failed to plead facts stating a plausible claim for violation of his\nconstitutional rights. The district court rejected those assertions. The district court\nconcluded that Heyne had stated a claim for violation of his procedural due process and\n\fNos. 09-6383/6464               Heyne, et al. v. Metropolitan Nashville               Page 7\n                                Public Schools, et al.\n\n\nequal protection rights and that the Individual Defendants were not entitled to qualified\nimmunity.\n\n                                             II.\n\n        Because Heyne brings suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and alleges that Defendants\nviolated his constitutional rights, the district court had original jurisdiction and removal\nwas proper. See 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1441; Hadix v. Johnson, 322 F.3d 895, 896 (6th Cir.\n2003); Dorsey v. City of Detroit, 858 F.2d 338, 340-41 (6th Cir. 1988). We have\njurisdiction over the district court’s denial of Individual Defendants’ motion to dismiss\nbased on qualified immunity. See Behrens v. Pelletier, 516 U.S. 299, 308 (1996);\nMitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 527, 530 (1985); Hudson v. Hudson, 475 F.3d 741,\n743 (6th Cir. 2007). We have pendent appellate jurisdiction over the portion of the\nMetropolitan Government’s appeal asking us to consider whether Heyne plausibly\ndemonstrated a violation of his constitutional rights by state officials. See Davenport v.\nCausey, 521 F.3d 544, 554 (6th Cir. 2008); Meals v. City of Memphis, 493 F.3d 720, 727\n(6th Cir. 2007); Tucker v. City of Richmond, 388 F.3d 216, 224 (6th Cir. 2004).\n\n        “To state a claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, a plaintiff must set forth facts that,\nwhen construed favorably, establish (1) the deprivation of a right secured by the\nConstitution or laws of the United States (2) caused by a person acting under the color\nof state law.” Marvin v. City of Taylor, 509 F.3d 234, 243 (6th Cir. 2007) (quoting\nSigley v. City of Parma Heights, 437 F.3d 527, 533 (6th Cir. 2006)). Qualified immunity\nshields government officials performing discretionary functions from liability if they\nhave violated an individual’s constitutional right, but that right was not “clearly\nestablished” when the officials acted. Id. (citation omitted). Thus, a two-part test\ndetermines whether qualified immunity applies: “(1) whether, considering the allegations\nin a light most favorable to the party injured, a constitutional right has been violated, and\n(2) whether that right was clearly established.” Colvin v. Caruso, 605 F.3d 282, 290 (6th\nCir. 2010) (quoting Estate of Carter v. City of Detroit, 408 F.3d 305, 310 (6th Cir.\n2005)). “We are ‘free to consider [the two-part test] in whatever order is appropriate in\n\fNos. 09-6383/6464                Heyne, et al. v. Metropolitan Nashville               Page 8\n                                 Public Schools, et al.\n\n\nlight of the issues before us’” and may begin with the second step. Id. (quoting Jones\nv. Byrnes, 585 F.3d 971, 975 (6th Cir. 2009)); see Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223,\n236 (2009).\n\n        When a defendant appeals the denial of a motion to dismiss based on qualified\nimmunity, we review de novo whether the complaint alleges violation of a clearly\nestablished constitutional right. See Hardy v. Jefferson Cmty. Coll., 260 F.3d 671, 677\n(6th Cir. 2001); see also May v. Franklin Cnty. Bd. of Comm’rs, 59 F. App’x 786, 790\n(6th Cir. 2003). No heightened pleading requirement applies. See Back v. Hall, 537\nF.3d 552, 556 (6th Cir. 2008) (stating that “nothing about the defense of qualified\nimmunity alters th[e] modest pleading requirement” of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n8(a)). “Just as we gauge other pleading-stage dismissals to determine only whether the\ncomplaint states a claim upon which relief can be granted, . . . so we review an assertion\nof qualified immunity to determine only whether the complaint ‘adequately alleges the\ncommission of acts that violated clearly established law.’” Id. at 555 (quoting Mitchell,\n472 U.S. at 526). We apply the ordinary standard used in reviewing motions to dismiss,\naccepting well-pled factual allegations as true. See id. at 554-56; Hardy, 260 F.3d at\n677. The test is whether, reading the complaint in the light most favorable to the\nplaintiff, it is plausible that an official’s acts violated the plaintiff’s clearly established\nconstitutional right. See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 1949 (2009); In re NM\nHoldings Co., 622 F.3d 613, 618 (6th Cir. 2010); Colvin, 605 F.3d at 290.\n\n        This appeal presents three issues: first, whether we should ascribe the acts of all\nIndividual Defendants to each defendant in determining whether the Individual\nDefendants are entitled to qualified immunity; second, whether the district court\ncommitted reversible error when it concluded that Heyne had stated a plausible claim\nfor violation of his procedural due process rights under § 1983 and that the Individual\nDefendants were not entitled to qualified immunity on that claim; and third, whether the\ndistrict court committed reversible error when it concluded that Heyne had stated a\nplausible claim for violation of his equal protection rights under § 1983 and that the\nIndividual Defendants were not entitled to qualified immunity on that claim.\n\fNos. 09-6383/6464              Heyne, et al. v. Metropolitan Nashville               Page 9\n                               Public Schools, et al.\n\n\n                                           A.\n\n       Heyne argues that the Amended Complaint alleges the Individual Defendants\nviolated his constitutional rights as part of a conspiracy and, therefore, that the acts,\nknowledge, and intentions of each individual defendant are attributable to all Individual\nDefendants.    Heyne argues that this Court must consider all of the Individual\nDefendants’ acts in determining whether he alleges constitutional violations sufficiently.\nThe Individual Defendants and the Metropolitan Government argue that the Amended\nComplaint does not plead a conspiracy claim sufficiently and that each individual\ndefendant’s assertion of qualified immunity must be considered separately.\n\n       In Spadafore v. Gardner, 330 F.3d 849 (6th Cir. 2003), we stated the standard\ngoverning a § 1983 conspiracy claim:\n\n       A civil conspiracy is an agreement between two or more persons to injure\n       another by unlawful action. Express agreement among all the\n       conspirators is not necessary to find the existence of a civil conspiracy.\n       Each conspirator need not have known all of the details of the illegal plan\n       or all of the participants involved. All that must be shown is that there\n       was a single plan, that the alleged coconspirator shared in the general\n       conspiratorial objective, and that an overt act was committed in\n       furtherance of the conspiracy that caused injury to the complainant.\n\n330 F.3d at 854 (quoting Hooks v. Hooks, 771 F.2d 935, 943-44 (6th Cir. 1985)).\nAlthough circumstantial evidence may prove a conspiracy, “[i]t is well-settled that\nconspiracy claims must be pled with some degree of specificity and that vague and\nconclusory allegations unsupported by material facts will not be sufficient to state such\na claim under § 1983.” Id. (quoting Gutierrez v. Lynch, 826 F.2d 1534, 1538 (6th Cir.\n1987)); accord Farhat v. Jopke, 370 F.3d 580, 599 (6th Cir. 2004). That pleading\nstandard is “relatively strict.” Fieger v. Cox, 524 F.3d 770, 776 (6th Cir. 2008).\n\n       Here, the Amended Complaint does not contain a separate count for conspiracy\nto violate Heyne’s constitutional rights. The only paragraph in which Heyne discusses\nconspiracy is vague and consists primarily of legal conclusions: “Defendants have\nconspired among themselves and with others unnamed in the [MNPS] system to\n\fNos. 09-6383/6464               Heyne, et al. v. Metropolitan Nashville             Page 10\n                                Public Schools, et al.\n\n\nknowingly and intentionally deny [Heyne]’s constitutional rights. They have also\nconspired with D.A.’s parents to support D.A.’s claim against the Heynes’ insurance\ncarrier for compensation.” We need not accept these legal conclusions as true, and we\ndecline to do so. See Jones v. City of Cincinnati, 521 F.3d 555, 559 (6th Cir. 2008).\nLegal conclusions that are “masquerading as factual allegations” will not suffice. Terry\nv. Tyson Farms, Inc., 604 F.3d 272, 276 (6th Cir. 2010) (quoting Tam Travel, Inc. v.\nDelta Airlines, Inc., 583 F.3d 896, 903 (6th Cir. 2009)). The Amended Complaint\ncontains other allegations about the Individual Defendants’ conferring with one another\nat different points in Heyne’s disciplinary process, but it does not contain any more\nspecific allegations of a plan or agreement to violate his constitutional rights.\n\n        Heyne’s factual allegations of a conspiracy are no more specific than other\nallegations we have deemed insufficient. See Moldowan v. City of Warren, 578 F.3d\n351, 394-95 (6th Cir. 2009); Gutierrez, 826 F.2d at 1538-39; cf. Spadafore, 330 F.3d at\n854 (affirming summary judgment on plaintiffs’ § 1983 conspiracy claim where they did\nnot submit any evidence suggesting that defendants had a single plan when they\nallegedly made false statements). Heyne’s failure to plead a plan or agreement to violate\nhis constitutional rights is fatal to his conspiracy claim. See Mettetal v. Vanderbilt Univ.,\nLegal Dep’t, 147 F. App’x 577, 585 (6th Cir. 2005) (concluding that a district court\ncorrectly dismissed certain conspiracy claims for failure to allege that the parties had\nentered into an agreement or formed a single plan). Heyne has not plausibly stated a\nconspiracy claim.\n\n        “This Court has consistently held that damage claims against government\nofficials arising from alleged violations of constitutional rights must allege, with\nparticularity, facts that demonstrate what each defendant did to violate the asserted\nconstitutional right.” Lanman v. Hinson, 529 F.3d 673, 684 (6th Cir. 2008) (citing\nTerrance v. Northville Reg’l Psychiatric Hosp., 286 F.3d 834, 842 (6th Cir. 2002)). We\nmust analyze separately whether Heyne has stated a plausible constitutional violation by\neach individual defendant, and we cannot ascribe the acts of all Individual Defendants\nto each individual defendant. See id. at 684-88; Hull v. Cuyahoga Valley Joint\n\fNos. 09-6383/6464             Heyne, et al. v. Metropolitan Nashville            Page 11\n                              Public Schools, et al.\n\n\nVocational Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ., 926 F.2d 505, 512-15 (6th Cir. 1991); see also\nColvin, 605 F.3d at 292 (“Allegations of respondeat superior do not sustain a § 1983\nclaim against state employees in their individual capacities, meaning that officials are\npersonally liable for damages under that statute ‘only for their own unconstitutional\nbehavior.’” (quoting Leach v. Shelby Cnty. Sheriff, 891 F.2d 1241, 1246 (6th Cir.\n1989))).\n\n                                           B.\n\n       The starting point for analyzing alleged violations of students’ procedural due\nprocess rights in school suspension cases is Goss v. Lopez, 419 U.S. 565 (1975). See\nLaney v. Farley, 501 F.3d 577, 581 (6th Cir. 2007); Webb v. McCullough, 828 F.2d\n1151, 1159 (6th Cir. 1987). In Goss, the Supreme Court concluded that students facing\nsuspensions of ten days or fewer have a property interest in educational benefits and a\nliberty interest in their reputations that qualify them for protection against arbitrary\nsuspensions under the Due Process Clause. See Goss, 419 U.S. at 576 (“A 10-day\nsuspension from school is not de minimis in our view and may not be imposed in\ncomplete disregard of the Due Process Clause. . . . Neither the property interest in\neducational benefits temporarily denied nor the liberty interest in reputation, which is\nalso implicated, is so insubstantial that suspensions may constitutionally be imposed by\nany procedure the school chooses, no matter how arbitrary.”); see also id. at 579 (“The\nstudent’s interest is to avoid unfair or mistaken exclusion from the educational process,\nwith all of its unfortunate consequences.”).\n\n        A school official must follow certain procedures before he may constitutionally\nsuspend a student for ten days or fewer:\n\n       Students facing temporary suspension have interests qualifying for\n       protection of the Due Process Clause, and due process requires, in\n       connection with a suspension of 10 days or less, that the student be given\n       oral or written notice of the charges against him and, if he denies them,\n       an explanation of the evidence the authorities have and an opportunity to\n       present his side of the story. The Clause requires at least these\n\fNos. 09-6383/6464              Heyne, et al. v. Metropolitan Nashville              Page 12\n                               Public Schools, et al.\n\n\n       rudimentary precautions against unfair or mistaken findings of\n       misconduct and arbitrary exclusion from school.\n\nId. at 581. “Having chosen to extend the right to an education to people of [students’]\nclass generally, [a state] may not withdraw that right on grounds of misconduct, absent\nfundamentally fair procedures to determine whether the misconduct has occurred.” Id.\nat 574 (citations omitted).\n\n       The Due Process Clause does not require that hearings in connection with\nsuspensions of ten days or fewer follow trial-type procedures. See id. at 583. Due\nprocess does not give students the right to be represented by counsel, to confront and\ncross-examine witnesses against them, or to call their own witnesses. See id. It requires\nonly minimal procedural protections:\n\n       There need be no delay between the time “notice” is given and the time\n       of the hearing. In the great majority of cases the disciplinarian may\n       informally discuss the alleged misconduct with the student minutes after\n       it has occurred. We hold only that, in being given an opportunity to\n       explain his version of the facts at this discussion, the student first be told\n       what he is accused of doing and what the basis of the accusation is.\n\nId. at 582. “[A]n informal give-and-take between student and disciplinarian, preferably\nprior to the suspension” satisfies due process. Id. at 584. When a student’s “presence\nposes a continuing danger to persons or property or an ongoing threat of disrupting the\nacademic process,” the student may be immediately removed from school without an\ninformal give-and-take exchange. Id. at 582; see Buchanan v. City of Bolivar, 99 F.3d\n1352, 1359 (6th Cir. 1996) (citations omitted). In that event, “the necessary notice and\nrudimentary hearing should follow as soon as practicable[.]” Goss, 419 U.S. at 582-83.\n\n       We require no more process in the context of school suspensions of ten days or\nfewer than Goss demands. See Williams ex rel. Allen v. Cambridge Bd. of Educ., 370\nF.3d 630, 642 (6th Cir. 2004); see also Buchanan, 99 F.3d at 1359 (noting that “once\nschool administrators tell a student what they heard or saw, ask why they heard or saw\nit, and allow a brief response, a student has received all the process that the Fourteenth\n\fNos. 09-6383/6464              Heyne, et al. v. Metropolitan Nashville            Page 13\n                               Public Schools, et al.\n\n\nAmendment demands[.]” (quoting C.B. by Breeding v. Driscoll, 82 F.3d 383, 386 (11th\nCir. 1996))). We have consistently rejected arguments that students are entitled to\ngreater process under the Due Process Clause. See, e.g., Williams ex rel. Allen, 370 F.3d\nat 641-42 (rejecting a student’s argument that his due process rights were violated\nbecause he did not receive written notice of his suspension as required by state law);\nParedes by Koppenhoefer v. Curtis, 864 F.2d 426, 429 (6th Cir. 1988) (rejecting a\nstudent’s argument that he was entitled to cross-examine an anonymous student\ninformant and be told that student’s identity); Webb, 828 F.2d at 1159-60 (stating that,\nwhere a student argued that she was denied due process by her principal’s failure to refer\nan incident to the school board as required by Tennessee law and the record was silent\non whether the referral occurred, the student received all the process to which she was\nentitled under Goss, and affirming summary judgment on the student’s due process\nclaim).\n\n          Here, Heyne argues that the Amended Complaint sufficiently alleges that the\nIndividual Defendants violated his procedural due process rights because of their bias\nthroughout the disciplinary process. The Metropolitan Government and the Individual\nDefendants disagree, arguing that he received sufficient process under Goss.\n\n          The Amended Complaint does not state clearly when Heyne first received an\nexplanation of the evidence against him and an opportunity to explain his version of the\nfacts about the incident with D.A. According to the Amended Complaint, Manuel\ncharged Heyne with reckless endangerment and summarily suspended him for two days\non Tuesday, September 9, 2008. After the summary suspension, Manuel charged Heyne\nwith using an object in an assaultive manner and cruelty to a student, increased Heyne’s\nsuspension to ten days, and referred the matter to the Disciplinary Hearing Board of\nMNPS. The Amended Complaint does not state whether, before suspending Heyne\ninitially for two days or increasing his suspension to ten days, Manuel explained the\nevidence against Heyne or offered him the opportunity to present his side of the story.\nEven construing the Amended Complaint in the light most favorable to Heyne, Heyne\n\fNos. 09-6383/6464              Heyne, et al. v. Metropolitan Nashville            Page 14\n                               Public Schools, et al.\n\n\ndoes not allege that his first opportunity to present his side of the story occurred when\nhe appeared before the Disciplinary Hearing Board.\n\n       Heyne asserts in the Amended Complaint that five school officials—Manuel,\nPerry, Jones, Chambers, and Thompson—violated his procedural due process rights.\nThe first issue is whether Heyne has stated a plausible procedural due process claim\nagainst the school officials who allegedly played a role in the decision to suspend him:\nManuel, Perry, and Jones. The second is whether Heyne has stated a plausible\nprocedural due process claim against the school officials who participated in the process\nthat occurred after Heyne had been suspended: Chambers and Thompson.\n\n                                            1.\n\n       Procedural due process is not satisfied when a person has a protected interest\nunder the Due Process Clause and the individual responsible for deciding whether to\ndeprive that person of his interest is biased. See Withrow v. Larkin, 421 U.S. 35, 47\n(1975) (stating that “a biased decisionmaker [is] constitutionally unacceptable”);\nMcKinney v. Pate, 20 F.3d 1550, 1561 (11th Cir. 1994) (“It is axiomatic that, in general,\nthe Constitution requires that the state provide fair procedures and an impartial\ndecisionmaker before infringing on a person’s interest in life, liberty, or property.”);\nNasierowski Bros. Inv. Co. v. City of Sterling Heights, 949 F.2d 890, 897 n.8 (6th Cir.\n1991) (“[I]t is a hallmark of procedural due process that ‘a biased decisionmaker is\nconstitutionally unacceptable . . . .’” (quoting Withrow, 421 U.S. at 47)); cf. Mathews v.\nEldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 333 (1976) (“The fundamental requirement of due process is the\nopportunity to be heard ‘at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.’” (quoting\nArmstrong v. Manzo, 380 U.S. 545, 552 (1965))).\n\n       Consistent with that principle, the Supreme Court recognized in Goss that\nstudents have interests under the Due Process Clause qualifying them for protection\n“against unfair or mistaken findings of misconduct and arbitrary exclusion from school”\nin the context of school suspensions of ten days or fewer. Goss, 419 U.S. at 581. A\nconcern for fairness pervades Goss. See, e.g., id. at 579-80 (“The student’s interest is\n\fNos. 09-6383/6464              Heyne, et al. v. Metropolitan Nashville            Page 15\n                               Public Schools, et al.\n\n\nto avoid unfair or mistaken exclusion from the educational process, with all of its\nunfortunate consequences.      The Due Process Clause will not shield him from\nsuspensions properly imposed, but it disserves both his interest and the interest of the\nState if his suspension is in fact unwarranted. The concern would be mostly academic\nif the disciplinary process were a totally accurate, unerring process, never mistaken and\nnever unfair. Unfortunately, that is not the case, and no one suggests that it is.”)\n(emphasis added); id. at 581 (stating that the Due Process Clause requires certain\nprecautions against unfair findings of misconduct); id. at 583 (explaining that “we have\nimposed requirements which are, if anything, less than a fair-minded school principal\nwould impose upon himself in order to avoid unfair suspensions[.]”) (emphasis added).\n\n       Based on its concern for fairness and its recognition that students have protected\ninterests under the Due Process Clause, the Supreme Court concluded in Goss that due\nprocess requires a school to provide “fundamentally fair procedures” before suspending\na student for ten days or fewer. See id. at 574 (citations omitted). To insure\n“fundamentally fair procedures,” school officials responsible for deciding whether to\nexclude a student from school must be impartial. See Newsome v. Batavia Local Sch.\nDist., 842 F.2d 920, 927 (6th Cir. 1988) (rejecting procedural due process claim that\nschool official’s dual role rendered him impermissibly biased, but acknowledging that\nevidence of pre-existing animus or actual bias could require disqualification); see also\nMurray v. W. Baton Rouge Parish Sch. Bd., 472 F.2d 438, 443 (5th Cir. 1973) (“Due\nprocess in the schools does not require that a court of law be convened to hear every\nsuspension, and we find that a hearing before the superintendent is, at least\npresumptively, adequate to meet the requirements for a fair, impartial hearing. This is\nnot to say that if it can be clearly shown that the superintendent was biased or in any way\nunable to function fairly as a trier of fact, that a violation of due process cannot be\nshown.”). To hold otherwise would require process solely for the sake of process in\nschool suspension cases, a position we reject.\n\n       The impartiality demanded by due process does not preclude many common\nschool disciplinary practices. For example, the Fifth and Seventh Circuits have\n\fNos. 09-6383/6464               Heyne, et al. v. Metropolitan Nashville             Page 16\n                                Public Schools, et al.\n\n\nconcluded that due process is not necessarily violated when the school official who\ninitiates, investigates, or prosecutes charges against a student plays a role in the decision\nto suspend the student. See Lamb v. Panhandle Cmty. Unit Sch. Dist. No. 2, 826 F.2d\n526, 529-30 (7th Cir. 1987); Brewer by Dreyfus v. Austin Indep. Sch. Dist., 779 F.2d\n260, 264 (5th Cir. 1985). The Supreme Court has implied that due process does not\nnecessarily bar a school official who witnesses student misconduct from deciding to\nsuspend the student. See Goss, 419 U.S. at 584 (stating that a school official who\nwitnesses student misconduct may suspend the student so long as “an informal give-and-\ntake” occurs between the student and the school official); Schaill by Kross v. Tippecanoe\nCnty. Sch. Corp., 864 F.2d 1309, 1324 (7th Cir. 1988) (stating that “we note that the\nSupreme Court in Goss specifically contemplated that a school official with personal\nknowledge of the grounds for discipline might serve as the hearing officer, consistent\nwith the requirements of due process[.]”). The Eleventh Circuit has stated that “[i]n the\nschool context, it is both impossible and undesirable for administrators involved in\nincidents of misbehavior always to be precluded from acting as decisionmakers” and has\nconcluded as a matter of law that no violation of a student’s procedural due process\nrights occurred when a student had injured the principal who decided to suspend her.\nSee C.B. by Breeding, 82 F.3d at 385, 387 n.3. The Eighth Circuit has concluded that\nthe mere fact that students have sued a principal does not preclude the principal from\nlater suspending the students where no personal involvement or animus by the principal\nwas implicated, the principal began investigating the students’ misconduct before the\nlawsuit, the suspensions were unrelated to the lawsuit, and the suspensions were based\non a published, longstanding school policy. See Jennings v. Wentzville R-IV Sch. Dist.,\n397 F.3d 1118, 1125 (8th Cir. 2005).\n\n        Here, we are presented with factual allegations plausibly suggesting that Manuel\nwas not an impartial decision-maker. Before the incident between Heyne, a Caucasian,\nand D.A., an African-American, Manuel allegedly instructed the staff at Hillsboro to be\nmore lenient in enforcing the Code of Conduct against African-American students. At\nsome point Manuel also allegedly admitted that he decided to suspend Heyne to “cover”\n\fNos. 09-6383/6464               Heyne, et al. v. Metropolitan Nashville              Page 17\n                                Public Schools, et al.\n\n\nhimself and Hillsboro, presumably from liability for the incident in the face of a\nthreatened lawsuit by D.A.’s parents. Manuel did not discipline D.A. for his threat to\nHeyne although the Code of Conduct prohibits threats by students. Before suspending\nHeyne, Manuel was aware that MNPS maintained statistics on student discipline,\nincluding the race of students subject to discipline.\n\n        Taken as a whole, the Amended Complaint’s factual allegations, which we must\naccept as true, plausibly suggest that Manuel’s ability to impartially determine the\nappropriate discipline in relation to the September 5, 2008 incident had been manifestly\ncompromised—by virtue of his knowledge of and expressed concern about student\ndiscipline statistics, his instructions to faculty and staff concerning discipline of African-\nAmerican students, and his reaction to communications with the parents of D.A. These\nare the kinds of specific facts, indicating the presence of pre-existing bias, that this Court\nhas recognized could give rise to a valid claim for infringement of the due process right\nto an impartial decisionmaker in the context of student discipline. Newsome, 842 F.2d\nat 927, n.5. Viewing the allegations in the light most favorable to plaintiff Heyne, as we\nmust, we conclude that a reasonable school official in Manuel’s alleged position should\nhave known that his impartiality was compromised and that his participation in the\ndiscipline decision-making process was not permissible. The impropriety of Manuel’s\nalleged conduct in failing to disqualify himself should have been apparent based on\nGoss, Newsome, and other precedent directly on point. See, e.g., Goss, 419 U.S. at 579-\n84; Remer v. Burlington Area Sch. Dist., 286 F.3d 1007, 1013 (7th Cir. 2002); Newsome,\n842 F.2d at 927; Lamb, 826 F.2d at 530; Brewer by Dreyfus, 779 F.2d at 264; Sullivan\nv. Houston Independent Sch. Dist., 475 F.2d 1071, 1077 (5th Cir. 1973) (identifying\nparticular facts that impermissibly compromised decisionmaker’s impartiality); Murray,\n472 F.2d at 443; cf. Gonzales v. McEuen, 435 F. Supp. 460, 464 (C.D. Cal. 1977)\n(noting in 1977 that “[n]o one doubts that a student charged with misconduct has a right\nto an impartial tribunal”). Heyne’s right to an unbiased decisionmaker was thus clearly\nestablished when Manuel acted. See Holzemer v. City of Memphis, 621 F.3d 512, 527\n(6th Cir. 2010) (defining contours of “clearly established”). Therefore, we hold that\n\fNos. 09-6383/6464              Heyne, et al. v. Metropolitan Nashville           Page 18\n                               Public Schools, et al.\n\n\nHeyne has stated a facially valid claim against Manuel under § 1983 for violating his\nright to procedural due process. The district court’s denial of Manuel’s motion to\ndismiss based on qualified immunity is AFFIRMED.\n\n       Reading the Amended Complaint in the light most favorable to Heyne, Perry and\nJones directed Manuel to enhance both the charges against and the discipline imposed\non Heyne. Perry and Jones did so although they knew Heyne posed no danger to persons\nor property and was not disrupting the academic process, as evidenced by his returning\nto school nearly two days before Manuel suspended him. Like Manuel, they were aware\nthat MNPS maintained statistics on student discipline, including the race of students\nsubject to discipline. Perry and Jones were integrally involved in the decision-making\nprocess and ostensibly share responsibility with Manuel. Although the Amended\nComplaint is devoid of specific allegations of their personal bias against Heyne, their\nalleged integral involvement in the decision-making process is sufficient at this stage to\nmake out a colorable claim against them. The Amended Complaint permits the\nconclusion that their impartiality, like Manuel’s, was compromised.\n\n       Taken as a whole and read in the light most favorable to Heyne, the Amended\nComplaint’s factual allegations plausibly suggest that Perry and Jones were not\nimpartial. For the reasons discussed above, the unlawfulness of their conduct at the time\nthey acted was apparent, Heyne’s right to procedural due process was clearly established\nat the time they acted, and reasonable officials in their alleged positions would have\nunderstood that their actions violated that right. See, e.g., Goss, 419 U.S. at 579-84;\nNewsome, 842 F.2d at 927; Lamb, 826 F.2d at 530; Brewer by Dreyfus, 779 F.2d at 264;\nMurray, 472 F.2d at 443; Gonzales, 435 F. Supp. at 464. Therefore, we hold that Heyne\nhas stated a claim against Perry and Jones under § 1983 for violating his right to\nprocedural due process. The district court’s denial of Perry’s and Jones’ motion to\ndismiss based on qualified immunity is AFFIRMED.\n\fNos. 09-6383/6464              Heyne, et al. v. Metropolitan Nashville            Page 19\n                               Public Schools, et al.\n\n\n                                            2.\n\n       “The Due Process Clause . . . sets only the floor or lowest level of procedures\nacceptable.” Flaim v. Med. Coll. of Ohio, 418 F.3d 629, 636 (6th Cir. 2005). Students\nhave no constitutional right to appeal the decision of school officials to suspend them for\nten days or fewer. See Williams ex rel. Allen, 370 F.3d at 640-41; Maimonis v.\nUrbanski, 143 F. App’x 699, 703 (7th Cir. 2005); Smith ex rel. Smith v. Severn, 129 F.3d\n419, 428-29 (7th Cir. 1997); Brewer by Dreyfus, 779 F.2d at 263; cf. Flaim, 418 F.3d at\n642 (“Courts have consistently held that there is no right to an appeal from an academic\ndisciplinary hearing [in public universities] that satisfies due process.”) (citations\nomitted). Any greater process provided by a state, such as review by a school board, is\n“completely gratuitous.” Smith ex rel. Smith, 129 F.3d at 429; see Laney, 501 F.3d at\n580 n.2; Williams ex rel. Allen, 370 F.3d at 640-41. Any such additional procedural\nprotections are not required by due process nor do they give rise to any due process\nrights. See Laney, 501 F.3d at 580 n.2; Williams ex rel. Allen, 370 F.3d at 640-42; Smith\nex rel. Smith, 129 F.3d at 429; Gonzales, 435 F. Supp. at 463; cf. Webb, 828 F.2d at 1159\n(stating that, even if a principal violated sections of the high school’s student-parent\nhandbook and Tennessee statutes in suspending a student, “the violations would not\npresent an issue cognizable in federal court[.]”).\n\n       Here, Heyne had no procedural due process right to appeal his suspension. See\nMaimonis, 143 F. App’x at 703; Williams ex rel. Allen, 370 F.3d at 640-41; Smith ex rel.\nSmith, 129 F.3d at 429. School officials’ alleged acts during Heyne’s appeals of his\nsuspension did not implicate and could not violate Heyne’s right to procedural due\nprocess even if contrary to school policies and procedures or Tennessee law. See Laney,\n501 F.3d at 580 n.2; Williams ex rel. Allen, 370 F.3d at 640-42; Smith ex rel. Smith, 129\nF.3d at 429; Gonzales, 435 F. Supp. at 463; cf. White v. Salisbury Twp. Sch. Dist., 588\nF. Supp. 608, 614 (E.D. Pa. 1984) (“[W]here a state has issued regulations requiring\nschool districts to promulgate and publish specific procedural rules and safeguards\ngoverning suspensions, a failure to comply with those regulations would violate state\nlaw only and would not rise to the level of a constitutional violation.”).\n\fNos. 09-6383/6464              Heyne, et al. v. Metropolitan Nashville            Page 20\n                               Public Schools, et al.\n\n\n       Goss supports these principles. In Goss, the Supreme Court stated that greater\nprocess for students than the procedures expressly identified was undesirable:\n\n       Brief disciplinary suspensions are almost countless. To impose in each\n       such case even truncated trial-type procedures might well overwhelm\n       administrative facilities in many places and, by diverting resources, cost\n       more than it would save in educational effectiveness. Moreover, further\n       formalizing the suspension process and escalating its formality and\n       adversary nature may not only make it too costly as a regular disciplinary\n       tool but also destroy its effectiveness as part of the teaching process.\n\nGoss, 419 U.S. at 583. Allowing students to state claims for procedural due process\nviolations against officials participating in the type of process the Constitution does not\nrequire would further formalize the suspension process and increase its adversarial\nnature, two undesirable outcomes. See id.\n\n       The Amended Complaint alleges that Chambers and Thompson became involved\nin Heyne’s disciplinary process only after the Disciplinary Hearing Board had affirmed\nHeyne’s suspension. Heyne had no constitutional right to Disciplinary Hearing Board\nreview of Manuel’s decision and no constitutional right to appeal the Disciplinary\nHearing Board’s decision. See Williams ex rel. Allen, 370 F.3d at 640-41; Smith ex rel.\nSmith, 129 F.3d at 429. Chambers’ and Thompson’s actions did not implicate and,\ntherefore, could not have violated Heyne’s right to procedural due process. See Laney,\n501 F.3d at 580 n.2; Williams ex rel. Allen, 370 F.3d at 640-42; Smith ex rel. Smith,\n129 F.3d at 429. Therefore, we hold that Heyne has failed to state a claim against\nChambers and Thompson under § 1983 for violating his right to procedural due process.\nThe district court’s denial of Chambers’ and Thompson’s motion to dismiss based on\nqualified immunity is REVERSED.\n\n                                            C.\n\n       “The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits a state\nfrom denying to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.” S.S.\nv. E. Ky. Univ., 532 F.3d 445, 457 (6th Cir. 2008). “The Equal Protection Clause does\n\fNos. 09-6383/6464              Heyne, et al. v.

It simply keeps governmental decisionmakers from treating\ndifferently persons who are in all relevant respects alike.” Id. (quoting Nordlinger v.\nHahn, 505 U.S. 1, 10 (1992)); accord Buchanan, 99 F.3d at 1360 (“The Equal Protection\nClause requires public institutions to ‘treat similarly situated individuals in a similar\nmanner.’” (quoting Gutzwiller v. Fenik, 860 F.2d 1317, 1328 (6th Cir. 1988))).\n\n       School officials violate the Equal Protection Clause when they punish a student\nmore severely for his conduct than other students because of the student’s race.\nBuchanan, 99 F.3d at 1360 (stating in context of an Equal Protection claim alleging\ndifference in discipline based on race that “[t]he Equal Protection Clause requires public\ninstitutions to ‘treat similarly situated individuals in a similar manner.’” (quoting\nGutzwiller, 860 F.2d at 1328)); see also Billings v. Madison Metro. Sch. Dist., 259 F.3d\n807, 812-15 (7th Cir. 2001) (discussing the suspect nature of racial classifications in the\nschool context); Reese v. Jefferson Sch. Dist. No. 14J, 208 F.3d 736, 740 (9th Cir. 2000)\n(stating in the context of plaintiff’s § 1983 claim of disparate punishment on the basis\nof gender that “[t]o succeed on a § 1983 equal protection claim, the plaintiffs must prove\nthat the defendants acted in a discriminatory manner and that the discrimination was\nintentional.”). Direct or circumstantial evidence that a student’s race motivated school\nofficials’ actions may establish an Equal Protection Clause violation. See Vill. of\nArlington Heights v. Metro. Hous. Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 266 (1977); see also\nWeberg v.

Heyne alleges that, before the incident with\nD.A., Manuel instructed the staff at Hillsboro to be more lenient in enforcing the Code\nof Conduct against African-American students. When Manuel gave that instruction, he\n\fNos. 09-6383/6464              Heyne, et al. v. Metropolitan Nashville            Page 22\n                               Public Schools, et al.\n\n\nwas aware that MNPS maintained statistics on student discipline, including the race of\nstudents subject to discipline. Although Manuel was allegedly aware that D.A. had\nthreatened Heyne’s life in violation of the Code of Conduct, Manuel did not discipline\nD.A. Manuel increased Heyne’s suspension from two days to ten days although Manuel\nknew that Heyne posed no danger to persons or property and was not disrupting the\nacademic process, as evidenced by Heyne’s returning to school nearly two days before\nthe initial two-day suspension. Manuel allegedly admitted that he decided to suspend\nHeyne to “cover” himself and Hillsboro.\n\n       Read in the light most favorable to Heyne, the Amended Complaint contains\nwell-pled factual allegations we must accept as true suggesting that Manuel suspended\nHeyne for ten days based in part on Heyne’s race. Heyne’s factual allegations state a\nplausible claim against Manuel for violation of his right to equal protection. See\nMcLaurin v. Okla. State Regents for Higher Educ., 339 U.S. 637, 642 (1950); Buchanan,\n99 F.3d at 1360. Heyne’s right not to be disciplined based on his race was clearly\nestablished at the time of Manuel’s actions. See McLaurin, 339 U.S. at 642; Buchanan,\n99 F.3d at 1360. Therefore, we hold that Heyne has stated a claim against Manuel under\n§ 1983 for violating his right to equal protection. The district court’s denial of Manuel’s\nmotion to dismiss based on qualified immunity is AFFIRMED.\n\n       Heyne alleges that Perry and Jones directed Manuel to suspend him. As\nevidenced by Heyne’s returning to school nearly two days before Manuel suspended\nhim, Perry and Jones acted although they knew Heyne posed no danger to persons or\nproperty and was not disrupting the academic process. MNPS maintained statistics\nabout the race of students involved in disciplinary incidents, and Manuel punished\nHeyne but did not punish D.A., contrary to the Code of Conduct. Perry’s and Jones’\norder to suspend Heyne affected the racial statistics MNPS maintained.\n\n       Reading the Amended Complaint in the light most favorable to Heyne and\ndrawing reasonable inferences in his favor, Perry and Jones ordered Manuel to punish\nHeyne in part because of Heyne’s race. Heyne’s factual allegations state a plausible\n\fNos. 09-6383/6464             Heyne, et al. v. Metropolitan Nashville            Page 23\n                              Public Schools, et al.\n\n\nclaim against Perry and Jones for violation of his right to equal protection. See\nMcLaurin, 339 U.S. at 642; Buchanan, 99 F.3d at 1360. Heyne’s right not to be\ndisciplined based on his race was clearly established when Perry and Jones acted. See\nMcLaurin, 339 U.S. at 642; Buchanan, 99 F.3d at 1360. Therefore, we hold that Heyne\nhas stated a claim against Perry and Jones under § 1983 for violating his right to equal\nprotection. See McLaurin, 339 U.S. at 642; Buchanan, 99 F.3d at 1360. The district\ncourt’s denial of Perry’s and Jones’ motion to dismiss based on qualified immunity is\nAFFIRMED.\n\n       Heyne has offered no well-pled factual allegations that Chambers or Thompson\nconsidered Heyne’s race. He alleges that they participated in the unfair denial of\nHeyne’s appeal of the Disciplinary Hearing Board’s decision. Even if true, Heyne has\nnot alleged that his race motivated their actions. None of his allegations constitutes\ndirect or circumstantial evidence that Chambers or Thompson discriminated or intended\nto discriminate against Heyne because of his race. Heyne does assert that Chambers and\nThompson violated his equal protection rights. That allegation is a legal conclusion that\nwe need not accept as true. See Jones, 521 F.3d at 559. We hold that Heyne has failed\nto state a claim against Chambers and Thompson under § 1983 for violating his right to\nequal protection. The district court’s denial of Chambers’ and Thompson’s motion to\ndismiss based on qualified immunity is REVERSED.\n\n                                          III.\n\n       The Metropolitan Government argues on appeal that Heyne has failed to state a\nplausible procedural due process or equal protection claim. Based on the prior analysis,\nthe Metropolitan Government’s argument is not well-taken as to Manuel, Perry, and\nJones. The district court’s denial of the Metropolitan Government’s motion to dismiss\nHeyne’s procedural due process and equal protection claims based on the conduct of\nManuel, Perry, and Jones is AFFIRMED. However, the Metropolitan Government’s\nargument is well-taken as to Chambers and Thompson based on the prior analysis. The\ndistrict court’s denial of the Metropolitan Government’s motion to dismiss Heyne’s\n\fNos. 09-6383/6464            Heyne, et al. v.

We REVERSE the\ndistrict court’s denial of Chambers’ and Thompson’s motion to dismiss based on\nqualified immunity.\n\n       We AFFIRM the district court’s denial of the Metropolitan Government’s motion\nto dismiss Heyne’s procedural due process and equal protection claims based on the\nconduct of Manuel, Perry, and Jones. We REVERSE the district court’s denial of the\nMetropolitan Government’s motion to dismiss Heyne’s procedural due process and equal\nprotection claims based on the conduct of Chambers and Thompson.\n\n       We REMAND for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\f",

Elbert, Neal &amp; Harwell, Nashville, Tennessee, for Appellees.</p>\n<p>Before: McKEAGUE and STRANCH, Circuit Judges; MAYS, District Judge.<sup>[*]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>OPINION</h2>\n<p>SAMUEL H. MAYS, JR., District Judge.</p>\n<p>Defendant Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County, Tennessee (\"Metropolitan Government\") and individual Defendants Rod Manuel, Fran Perry, Mary Chambers, Alvin Jones, and Ralph Thompson (\"Individual Defendants\") (collectively, \"Defendants\") appeal the order of the district court denying their motions to dismiss Plaintiff Christian Heyne's (\"Heyne\") Amended Complaint. In the Amended Complaint, Heyne seeks relief under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging that Defendants violated his right to procedural due process and equal protection when he was suspended from his high school for ten days. For the following reasons, we AFFIRM IN PART and REVERSE IN PART the district court's order.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>This dispute stems from Heyne's dissatisfaction with a ten-day suspension he received from Defendant Metropolitan Nashville Public Schools (\"MNPS\").<sup>[1]</sup> Heyne, a Caucasian, was a senior at Hillsboro High School (\"Hillsboro\") in Nashville, Tennessee, and played on Hillsboro's football team. On Friday, September 5, 2008, after football practice, Heyne and other players congregated in the narrow parking lot behind the locker room without adult supervision. D.A., an African-American student who played on the football team, stood with other players in the road leading to the exit from the parking lot. Heyne got into his car and drove along the road toward the exit. All of the students standing in the road except D.A. moved out of the way as Heyne approached. Heyne believed D.A. was standing far enough to the side of the road to allow him to continue driving. As Heyne approached the exit, the left front tire of his car made contact with D.A.'s foot, causing D.A. to fall backward and suffer, at most, a bruised or sprained ankle. Heyne put his car in reverse, got out, and apologized to D.A. In response, D.A. threatened to kill him.</p>\n<p>The MNPS Code of Conduct (\"Code of Conduct\") governs student conduct and discipline at Hillsboro. MNPS maintains statistics on student discipline, including the race of students subject to discipline. Before the incident between Heyne and D.A., Rod Manuel (\"Manuel\"), the Principal <span class=\"star-pagination\">*560</span> at Hillsboro, had instructed the staff at a meeting to be more lenient in enforcing the Code of Conduct against African-American students because too many African-American students were serving in-school suspensions.</p>\n<p>After the incident, D.A. and some of his friends immediately walked to Manuel's office to report what had happened. After meeting with D.A. and his friends, Manuel did not meet with any other witnesses and did not visit the scene of the incident. Although the Code of Conduct prohibits threats by students, Manuel did not discipline D.A. for threatening Heyne's life. Soon afterward, D.A.'s parents threatened to sue Hillsboro and demanded compensation from Heyne, his parents, and their insurance carrier. At some point, Manuel admitted that he decided to suspend Heyne to \"cover\" himself and Hillsboro, presumably from liability for the incident.</p>\n<p>Heyne returned to school on Monday, September 8, 2008. His only restriction was that he was not permitted to operate a car on campus. On the afternoon of Tuesday, September 9, Manuel charged Heyne with reckless endangerment under the Code of Conduct and summarily suspended him for two days. Fran Perry (\"Perry\"), the Discipline Coordinator for MNPS, and Alvin Jones (\"Jones\"), the Director of Attendance and Discipline for MNPS, allegedly directed Manuel to suspend Heyne. On Thursday, September 11, Manuel, allegedly at the direction of Perry and Jones, charged Heyne with two additional Code of Conduct violations, using an object in an assaultive manner and cruelty to a student, increased his suspension to ten days, and referred the matter to the Disciplinary Hearing Board of MNPS. The Amended Complaint does not state whether, before suspending Heyne initially for two days or increasing his suspension to ten days, Manuel explained the evidence against Heyne or offered him the opportunity to present his side of the story.</p>\n<p>Before the hearing, Heyne submitted written materials, including witness statements, for consideration by the Disciplinary Hearing Board. Those materials were not provided to Disciplinary Hearing Board panelists until they arrived at the hearing. In the notice of the hearing, MNPS implied that Heyne could be represented by an attorney at the proceeding if he followed certain steps, and Heyne hired an attorney. Nevertheless, Perry informed Heyne's attorney immediately before the hearing that he could not participate beyond passing notes to Heyne and his parents. Heyne was not allowed to present witnesses on his own behalf, although several MNPS employees had planned to testify for him. They were informed by Manuel that they would lose their jobs if they attended the hearing. The Amended Complaint does not state whether they attended.</p>\n<p>The Disciplinary Hearing Board met on September 23, 2008, to review the charges against Heyne. By then, he had served his ten-day suspension. Perry participated in the Disciplinary Hearing Board's deliberations, which were closed to Heyne, his parents, and his attorney. Perry was not a member of the Disciplinary Hearing Board, and the Code of Conduct provides that non-members cannot attend the Board's deliberations. The Disciplinary Hearing Board sustained the charge of reckless endangerment against Heyne and affirmed his suspension for ten days, allowing it to remain part of his permanent school record. Before affirming that charge, the Board refused to allow Heyne's counsel to explain the elements of reckless endangerment. The charges for using an object in an assaultive manner and cruelty to a student were dismissed. At some point during the hearing, the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*561</span> Disciplinary Hearing Board stated on the record that Heyne did not intend to hit D.A. and did not intend any act of cruelty toward a fellow student.</p>\n<p>The Code of Conduct allowed Heyne to appeal the Disciplinary Hearing Board's decision to the Director of MNPS, and he did so. The Code of Conduct permitted the Director of MNPS to delegate responsibility for deciding appeals. Chris Henson, the Interim Director of MNPS, designated Mary Chambers (\"Chambers\"), an employee in the Disciplinary Office of MNPS, to hear Heyne's appeal. Chambers worked in the same chain of command as Perry. In deciding Heyne's appeal, Chambers refused to consider an affidavit submitted on Heyne's behalf by the Hillsboro football team's orthopedic physician stating that D.A.'s injuries were minor and that Heyne had not endangered D.A. Chambers consulted with Ralph Thompson (\"Thompson\"), the Assistant Superintendent for Student Services for MNPS, Perry, Manuel, and an attorney for MNPS. Chambers ultimately denied the appeal. Pursuant to the Code of Conduct, Heyne appealed to the MNPS Board of Public Education, which had discretion to hear his appeal. The Board declined Heyne's request for a hearing and affirmed the suspension.</p>\n<p>Heyne graduated from Hillsboro in 2009. Before his suspension, several college recruiters had approached him about playing football on scholarship, and Congressman Jim Cooper had offered him a congressional appointment, the first step required to attend one of the United States military service academies. Because of the suspension, Heyne allegedly lost the opportunity to receive a scholarship because he missed two football games and his suspension was listed on his permanent school record. He also allegedly lost the opportunity to apply to the United States military service academies.</p>\n<p>On September 4, 2009, Heyne filed a complaint against MNPS, Manuel, Perry, Chambers, Jones, and Thompson in the Chancery Court of Tennessee for the 20th Judicial District at Nashville, Tennessee. Heyne amended his Complaint on September 10, 2009, adding the Metropolitan Government and the MNPS Board of Public Education as defendants. In the Amended Complaint, Heyne sought relief under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for (1) procedural due process violations by Defendants, (2) substantive due process violations by Defendants, (3) equal protection violations by Defendants, and (4) failure to train and supervise by the Metropolitan Government. Heyne also sought relief for state law negligence. Defendants subsequently removed the case to the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee under 28 U.S.C. § 1441. The Individual Defendants, the Metropolitan Government, and the Metropolitan Board of Public Education filed motions to dismiss. The district court granted their motions in part and dismissed Heyne's claims for substantive due process violations, failure to train, and negligence. The district court also dismissed Heyne's parents' claims, his claims against Individual Defendants in their official capacities, and his claims against MNPS and the Metropolitan Board of Public Education.</p>\n<p>The Metropolitan Government and the Individual Defendants appeal the district court's conclusions on the remaining parts of their motions to dismiss. The Individual Defendants assert that Heyne failed to state a § 1983 claim on which relief can be granted because they are entitled to qualified immunity. The Metropolitan Government asserts that Heyne has failed to plead facts stating a plausible claim for violation of his constitutional rights. The district court rejected those assertions. The district court concluded that Heyne had stated a claim for violation of his <span class=\"star-pagination\">*562</span> procedural due process and equal protection rights and that the Individual Defendants were not entitled to qualified immunity.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>Because Heyne brings suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and alleges that Defendants violated his constitutional rights, the district court had original jurisdiction and removal was proper. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1441; <i>Hadix v. Johnson,</i> 322 F.3d 895, 896 (6th Cir.2003); <i>Dorsey v. City of Detroit,</i> 858 F.2d 338, 340-41 (6th Cir.1988). We have jurisdiction over the district court's denial of Individual Defendants' motion to dismiss based on qualified immunity. <i>See </i><i>Behrens v. Pelletier,</i> 516 U.S. 299, 308, 116 S.Ct. 834, 133 L.Ed.2d 773 (1996); <i>Mitchell v. Forsyth,</i> 472 U.S. 511, 527, 530, 105 S.Ct. 2806, 86 L.Ed.2d 411 (1985); <i>Hudson v. Hudson,</i> 475 F.3d 741, 743 (6th Cir.2007). We have pendent appellate jurisdiction over the portion of the Metropolitan Government's appeal asking us to consider whether Heyne plausibly demonstrated a violation of his constitutional rights by state officials. <i>See </i><i>Davenport v. Causey,</i> 521 F.3d 544, 554 (6th Cir.2008); <i>Meals v. City of Memphis,</i> 493 F.3d 720, 727 (6th Cir.2007); <i>Tucker v. City of Richmond,</i> 388 F.3d 216, 224 (6th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p>\"To state a claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, a plaintiff must set forth facts that, when construed favorably, establish (1) the deprivation of a right secured by the Constitution or laws of the United States (2) caused by a person acting under the color of state law.\" <i>Marvin v. City of Taylor,</i> 509 F.3d 234, 243 (6th Cir.2007) (quoting <i>Sigley v. City of Parma Heights,</i> 437 F.3d 527, 533 (6th Cir.2006)). Qualified immunity shields government officials performing discretionary functions from liability if they have violated an individual's constitutional right, but that right was not \"clearly established\" when the officials acted. <i>Id.</i> (citation omitted). Thus, a two-part test determines whether qualified immunity applies: \"(1) whether, considering the allegations in a light most favorable to the party injured, a constitutional right has been violated, and (2) whether that right was clearly established.\" <i>Colvin v. Caruso,</i> 605 F.3d 282, 290 (6th Cir.2010) (quoting <i>Estate of Carter v.

Heyne argues that this Court must consider all of the Individual Defendants' acts in determining whether he alleges constitutional violations sufficiently. The Individual Defendants and the Metropolitan Government argue that the Amended Complaint does not plead a conspiracy claim sufficiently and that each individual defendant's assertion of qualified immunity must be considered separately.</p>\n<p>In <i>Spadafore v. Gardner,</i> 330 F.3d 849 (6th Cir.2003), we stated the standard governing a § 1983 conspiracy claim:</p>\n<blockquote>A civil conspiracy is an agreement between two or more persons to injure another by unlawful action. Express agreement among all the conspirators is not necessary to find the existence of a civil conspiracy. Each conspirator need not have known all of the details of the illegal plan or all of the participants involved. All that must be shown is that there was a single plan, that the alleged coconspirator shared in the general conspiratorial objective, and that an overt act was committed in furtherance of the conspiracy that caused injury to the complainant.</blockquote>\n<p>330 F.3d at 854 (quoting <i>Hooks v. Hooks,</i> 771 F.2d 935, 943-44 (6th Cir.1985)). Although circumstantial evidence may prove a conspiracy, \"[i]t is well-settled that conspiracy claims must be pled with some degree of specificity and that vague and conclusory allegations unsupported by material facts will not be sufficient to state such a claim under § 1983.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Gutierrez v.

Cox,</i> 524 F.3d 770, 776 (6th Cir. 2008).</p>\n<p>Here, the Amended Complaint does not contain a separate count for conspiracy to violate Heyne's constitutional rights. The only paragraph in which Heyne discusses conspiracy is vague and consists primarily of legal conclusions: \"Defendants have conspired among themselves and with others unnamed in the [MNPS] system to knowingly and intentionally deny [Heyne]'s constitutional rights. They have also conspired with D.A.'s parents to support D.A.'s claim against the Heynes' insurance carrier for compensation.\" We <span class=\"star-pagination\">*564</span> need not accept these legal conclusions as true, and we decline to do so. <i>See </i><i>Jones v. City of Cincinnati,</i> 521 F.3d 555, 559 (6th Cir.2008). Legal conclusions that are \"masquerading as factual allegations\" will not suffice. <i>Terry v. Tyson Farms, Inc.,</i> 604 F.3d 272, 276 (6th Cir.2010) (quoting <i>Tam Travel, Inc. v. Delta Airlines, Inc.,</i> 583 F.3d 896, 903 (6th Cir.2009)). The Amended Complaint contains other allegations about the Individual Defendants' conferring with one another at different points in Heyne's disciplinary process, but it does not contain any more specific allegations of a plan or agreement to violate his constitutional rights.</p>\n<p>Heyne's factual allegations of a conspiracy are no more specific than other allegations we have deemed insufficient. <i>See </i><i>Moldowan v. City of Warren,</i> 578 F.3d 351, 394-95 (6th Cir.2009); <i>Gutierrez,</i> 826 F.2d at 1538-39; <i>cf. </i><i>Spadafore,</i> 330 F.3d at 854 (affirming summary judgment on plaintiffs' § 1983 conspiracy claim where they did not submit any evidence suggesting that defendants had a single plan when they allegedly made false statements). Heyne's failure to plead a plan or agreement to violate his constitutional rights is fatal to his conspiracy claim. <i>See </i><i>Mettetal v. Vanderbilt Univ., Legal Dep't,</i> 147 Fed. Appx. 577, 585 (6th Cir.2005) (concluding that a district court correctly dismissed certain conspiracy claims for failure to allege that the parties had entered into an agreement or formed a single plan). Heyne has not plausibly stated a conspiracy claim.</p>\n<p>\"This Court has consistently held that damage claims against government officials arising from alleged violations of constitutional rights must allege, with particularity, facts that demonstrate what <i>each</i> defendant did to violate the asserted constitutional right.\" <i>Lanman v.

We must analyze separately whether Heyne has stated a plausible constitutional violation by each individual defendant, and we cannot ascribe the acts of all Individual Defendants to each individual defendant. <i>See id.</i> at 684-88; <i>Hull v.

Sheriff,</i> 891 F.2d 1241, 1246 (6th Cir.1989))).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B.</h2>\n<p>The starting point for analyzing alleged violations of students' procedural due process rights in school suspension cases is <i>Goss v. Lopez,</i> 419 U.S. 565, 95 S.Ct. 729, 42 L.Ed.2d 725 (1975). <i>See </i><i>Laney v. Farley,</i> 501 F.3d 577, 581 (6th Cir.2007); <i>Webb v. McCullough,</i> 828 F.2d 1151, 1159 (6th Cir.1987). In <i>Goss,</i> the Supreme Court concluded that students facing suspensions of ten days or fewer have a property interest in educational benefits and a liberty interest in their reputations that qualify them for protection against arbitrary suspensions under the Due Process Clause. <i>See </i><i>Goss,</i> 419 U.S. at 576, 95 S.Ct. 729 (\"A 10-day suspension from school is not de minimis in our view and may not be imposed in complete disregard of the Due Process Clause.... Neither the property interest in educational benefits temporarily denied nor the liberty interest in reputation, which is also implicated, is so insubstantial that suspensions may constitutionally be imposed by any procedure the school chooses, no matter how arbitrary.\"); <i>see also id.</i> at 579, 95 S.Ct. 729 (\"The student's interest is to avoid unfair or mistaken <span class=\"star-pagination\">*565</span> exclusion from the educational process, with all of its unfortunate consequences.\").</p>\n<p>A school official must follow certain procedures before he may constitutionally suspend a student for ten days or fewer:</p>\n<blockquote>Students facing temporary suspension have interests qualifying for protection of the Due Process Clause, and due process requires, in connection with a suspension of 10 days or less, that the student be given oral or written notice of the charges against him and, if he denies them, an explanation of the evidence the authorities have and an opportunity to present his side of the story. The Clause requires at least these rudimentary precautions against unfair or mistaken findings of misconduct and arbitrary exclusion from school.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 581, 95 S.Ct. 729. \"Having chosen to extend the right to an education to people of [students'] class generally, [a state] may not withdraw that right on grounds of misconduct, absent fundamentally fair procedures to determine whether the misconduct has occurred.\" <i>Id.</i> at 574, 95 S.Ct. 729 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p>The Due Process Clause does not require that hearings in connection with suspensions of ten days or fewer follow trial-type procedures. <i>See id.</i> at 583, 95 S.Ct. 729. Due process does not give students the right to be represented by counsel, to confront and cross-examine witnesses against them, or to call their own witnesses. <i>See id.</i> It requires only minimal procedural protections:</p>\n<blockquote>There need be no delay between the time \"notice\" is given and the time of the hearing. In the great majority of cases the disciplinarian may informally discuss the alleged misconduct with the student minutes after it has occurred. We hold only that, in being given an opportunity to explain his version of the facts at this discussion, the student first be told what he is accused of doing and what the basis of the accusation is.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 582, 95 S.Ct. 729. \"[A]n informal give-and-take between student and disciplinarian, preferably prior to the suspension\" satisfies due process. <i>Id.</i> at 584, 95 S.Ct. 729. When a student's \"presence poses a continuing danger to persons or property or an ongoing threat of disrupting the academic process,\" the student may be immediately removed from school without an informal give-and-take exchange. <i>Id.</i> at 582, 95 S.Ct. 729; <i>see </i><i>Buchanan v. City of Bolivar,</i> 99 F.3d 1352, 1359 (6th Cir.1996) (citations omitted). In that event, \"the necessary notice and rudimentary hearing should follow as soon as practicable[.]\" <i>Goss,</i> 419 U.S. at 582-83, 95 S.Ct. 729.</p>\n<p>We require no more process in the context of school suspensions of ten days or fewer than <i>Goss</i> demands. <i>See </i><i>Williams ex rel. Allen v. Cambridge Bd. of Educ.,</i> 370 F.3d 630, 642 (6th Cir.2004); <i>see also </i><i>Buchanan,</i> 99 F.3d at 1359 (noting that \"once school administrators tell a student what they heard or saw, ask why they heard or saw it, and allow a brief response, a student has received all the process that the Fourteenth Amendment demands[.]\" (quoting <i>C.B. by </i><i>Breeding v. Driscoll,</i> 82 F.3d 383, 386 (11th Cir.1996))). We have consistently rejected arguments that students are entitled to greater process under the Due Process Clause. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Williams ex rel. Allen,</i> 370 F.3d at 641-42 (rejecting a student's argument that his due process rights were violated because he did not receive written notice of his suspension as required by state law); <i>Paredes by </i><i>Koppenhoefer v. Curtis,</i> 864 F.2d 426, 429 (6th Cir.1988) (rejecting a student's argument that he was entitled to cross-examine an anonymous student informant and be told that student's identity); <i>Webb,</i> 828 F.2d at 1159-60 (stating that, where a student argued that she was <span class=\"star-pagination\">*566</span> denied due process by her principal's failure to refer an incident to the school board as required by Tennessee law and the record was silent on whether the referral occurred, the student received all the process to which she was entitled under <i>Goss,</i> and affirming summary judgment on the student's due process claim).</p>\n<p>Here, Heyne argues that the Amended Complaint sufficiently alleges that the Individual Defendants violated his procedural due process rights because of their bias throughout the disciplinary process. The Metropolitan Government and the Individual Defendants disagree, arguing that he received sufficient process under <i>Goss.</i></p>\n<p>The Amended Complaint does not state clearly when Heyne first received an explanation of the evidence against him and an opportunity to explain his version of the facts about the incident with D.A. According to the Amended Complaint, Manuel charged Heyne with reckless endangerment and summarily suspended him for two days on Tuesday, September 9, 2008. After the summary suspension, Manuel charged Heyne with using an object in an assaultive manner and cruelty to a student, increased Heyne's suspension to ten days, and referred the matter to the Disciplinary Hearing Board of MNPS. The Amended Complaint does not state whether, before suspending Heyne initially for two days or increasing his suspension to ten days, Manuel explained the evidence against Heyne or offered him the opportunity to present his side of the story. Even construing the Amended Complaint in the light most favorable to Heyne, Heyne does not allege that his first opportunity to present his side of the story occurred when he appeared before the Disciplinary Hearing Board.</p>\n<p>Heyne asserts in the Amended Complaint that five school officials  Manuel, Perry, Jones, Chambers, and Thompson  violated his procedural due process rights. The first issue is whether Heyne has stated a plausible procedural due process claim against the school officials who allegedly played a role in the decision to suspend him: Manuel, Perry, and Jones. The second is whether Heyne has stated a plausible procedural due process claim against the school officials who participated in the process that occurred after Heyne had been suspended: Chambers and Thompson.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1.</h2>\n<p>Procedural due process is not satisfied when a person has a protected interest under the Due Process Clause and the individual responsible for deciding whether to deprive that person of his interest is biased. <i>See </i><i>Withrow v. Larkin,</i> 421 U.S. 35, 47, 95 S.Ct. 1456, 43 L.Ed.2d 712 (1975) (stating that \"a biased decisionmaker [is] constitutionally unacceptable\"); <i>McKinney v. Pate,</i> 20 F.3d 1550, 1561 (11th Cir.1994) (\"It is axiomatic that, in general, the Constitution requires that the state provide fair procedures and an impartial decisionmaker before infringing on a person's interest in life, liberty, or property.\"); <i>Nasierowski Bros. Inv. Co. v. City of Sterling Heights,</i> 949 F.2d 890, 897 n. 8 (6th Cir. 1991) (\"[I]t is a hallmark of procedural due process that `a biased decisionmaker is constitutionally unacceptable....'\" (quoting <i>Withrow,</i> 421 U.S. at 47, 95 S.Ct. 1456)); <i>cf. </i><i>Mathews v. Eldridge,</i> 424 U.S. 319, 333, 96 S.Ct. 893, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976) (\"The fundamental requirement of due process is the opportunity to be heard `at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.'\" (quoting <i>Armstrong v. Manzo,</i> 380 U.S. 545, 552, 85 S.Ct. 1187, 14 L.Ed.2d 62 (1965))).</p>\n<p>Consistent with that principle, the Supreme Court recognized in <i>Goss</i> that students have interests under the Due Process Clause qualifying them for protection <span class=\"star-pagination\">*567</span> \"against unfair or mistaken findings of misconduct and arbitrary exclusion from school\" in the context of school suspensions of ten days or fewer. <i>Goss,</i> 419 U.S. at 581, 95 S.Ct. 729. A concern for fairness pervades <i>Goss. See, e.g., id.</i> at 579-80, 95 S.Ct. 729 (\"The student's interest is to avoid <i>unfair</i> or mistaken exclusion from the educational process, with all of its unfortunate consequences. <i>The Due Process Clause will not shield him from suspensions properly imposed, but it disserves both his interest and the interest of the State if his suspension is in fact unwarranted.</i> The concern would be mostly academic if the disciplinary process were a totally accurate, unerring process, never mistaken and never <i>unfair.</i> Unfortunately, that is not the case, and no one suggests that it is.\") (emphasis added); <i>id.</i> at 581, 95 S.Ct. 729 (stating that the Due Process Clause requires certain precautions against unfair findings of misconduct); <i>id.</i> at 583, 95 S.Ct. 729 (explaining that \"we have imposed requirements which are, if anything, less than a <i>fair</i>-minded school principal would impose upon himself in order to avoid <i>unfair</i> suspensions[.]\") (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>Based on its concern for fairness and its recognition that students have protected interests under the Due Process Clause, the Supreme Court concluded in <i>Goss</i> that due process requires a school to provide \"fundamentally fair procedures\" before suspending a student for ten days or fewer. <i>See id.</i> at 574, 95 S.Ct. 729 (citations omitted). To insure \"fundamentally fair procedures,\" school officials responsible for deciding whether to exclude a student from school must be impartial. <i>See </i><i>Newsome v. Batavia Local Sch. Dist.,</i> 842 F.2d 920, 927 (6th Cir.1988) (rejecting procedural due process claim that school official's dual role rendered him impermissibly biased, but acknowledging that evidence of pre-existing animus or actual bias could require disqualification); <i>see also </i><i>Murray v. W. Baton Rouge Parish Sch. Bd.,</i> 472 F.2d 438, 443 (5th Cir.1973) (\"Due process in the schools does not require that a court of law be convened to hear every suspension, and we find that a hearing before the superintendent is, at least presumptively, adequate to meet the requirements for a fair, impartial hearing. This is not to say that if it can be clearly shown that the superintendent was biased or in any way unable to function fairly as a trier of fact, that a violation of due process cannot be shown.\"). To hold otherwise would require process solely for the sake of process in school suspension cases, a position we reject.</p>\n<p>The impartiality demanded by due process does not preclude many common school disciplinary practices. For example, the Fifth and Seventh Circuits have concluded that due process is not necessarily violated when the school official who initiates, investigates, or prosecutes charges against a student plays a role in the decision to suspend the student. <i>See </i><i>Lamb v. Panhandle Cmty. Unit Sch. Dist. No. 2,</i> 826 F.2d 526, 529-30 (7th Cir.1987); <i>Brewer by </i><i>Dreyfus v. Austin Indep. Sch. Dist.,</i> 779 F.2d 260, 264 (5th Cir.1985). The Supreme Court has implied that due process does not necessarily bar a school official who witnesses student misconduct from deciding to suspend the student. <i>See </i><i>Goss,</i> 419 U.S. at 584, 95 S.Ct. 729 (stating that a school official who witnesses student misconduct may suspend the student so long as \"an informal give-and-take\" occurs between the student and the school official); <i>Schaill by </i><i>Kross v. Tippecanoe Cnty. Sch. Corp.,</i> 864 F.2d 1309, 1324 (7th Cir. 1988) (stating that \"we note that the Supreme Court in <i>Goss</i> specifically contemplated that a school official with personal knowledge of the grounds for discipline might serve as the hearing officer, consistent with the requirements of due process[.]\"). The Eleventh Circuit has stated <span class=\"star-pagination\">*568</span> that \"[i]n the school context, it is both impossible and undesirable for administrators involved in incidents of misbehavior always to be precluded from acting as decisionmakers\" and has concluded as a matter of law that no violation of a student's procedural due process rights occurred when a student had injured the principal who decided to suspend her. <i>See C.B. by </i><i>Breeding,</i> 82 F.3d at 385, 387 n. 3. The Eighth Circuit has concluded that the mere fact that students have sued a principal does not preclude the principal from later suspending the students where no personal involvement or animus by the principal was implicated, the principal began investigating the students' misconduct before the lawsuit, the suspensions were unrelated to the lawsuit, and the suspensions were based on a published, longstanding school policy. <i>See </i><i>Jennings v. Wentzville R-IV Sch. Dist.,</i> 397 F.3d 1118, 1125 (8th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p>Here, we are presented with factual allegations plausibly suggesting that Manuel was not an impartial decision-maker. Before the incident between Heyne, a Caucasian, and D.A., an African-American, Manuel allegedly instructed the staff at Hillsboro to be more lenient in enforcing the Code of Conduct against African-American students. At some point Manuel also allegedly admitted that he decided to suspend Heyne to \"cover\" himself and Hillsboro, presumably from liability for the incident in the face of a threatened lawsuit by D.A.'s parents. Manuel did not discipline D.A. for his threat to Heyne although the Code of Conduct prohibits threats by students. Before suspending Heyne, Manuel was aware that MNPS maintained statistics on student discipline, including the race of students subject to discipline.</p>\n<p>Taken as a whole, the Amended Complaint's factual allegations, which we must accept as true, plausibly suggest that Manuel's ability to impartially determine the appropriate discipline in relation to the September 5, 2008 incident had been manifestly compromised  by virtue of his knowledge of and expressed concern about student discipline statistics, his instructions to faculty and staff concerning discipline of African-American students, and his reaction to communications with the parents of D.A. These are the kinds of specific facts, indicating the presence of pre-existing bias, that this Court has recognized could give rise to a valid claim for infringement of the due process right to an impartial decisionmaker in the context of student discipline. <i>Newsome,</i> 842 F.2d at 927, n. 5. Viewing the allegations in the light most favorable to plaintiff Heyne, as we must, we conclude that a reasonable school official in Manuel's alleged position should have known that his impartiality was compromised and that his participation in the discipline decision-making process was not permissible. The impropriety of Manuel's alleged conduct in failing to disqualify himself should have been apparent based on <i>Goss, Newsome,</i> and other precedent directly on point. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Goss,</i> 419 U.S. at 579-84, 95 S.Ct. 729; <i>Remer v. Burlington Area Sch. Dist.,</i> 286 F.3d 1007, 1013 (7th Cir.2002); <i>Newsome,</i> 842 F.2d at 927; <i>Lamb,</i> 826 F.2d at 530; <i>Brewer by </i><i>Dreyfus,</i> 779 F.2d at 264; <i>Sullivan v. Houston Independent Sch. Dist.,</i> 475 F.2d 1071, 1077 (5th Cir.1973) (identifying particular facts that impermissibly compromised decisionmaker's impartiality); <i>Murray,</i> 472 F.2d at 443; <i>cf. </i><i>Gonzales v. McEuen,</i> 435 F.Supp. 460, 464 (C.D.Cal.1977) (noting in 1977 that \"[n]o one doubts that a student charged with misconduct has a right to an impartial tribunal\"). Heyne's right to an unbiased decisionmaker was thus clearly established when Manuel acted. <i>See </i><i>Holzemer v. City of Memphis,</i> 621 F.3d 512, 527 (6th Cir. 2010) (defining contours of \"clearly established\"). Therefore, we hold that Heyne <span class=\"star-pagination\">*569</span> has stated a facially valid claim against Manuel under § 1983 for violating his right to procedural due process. The district court's denial of Manuel's motion to dismiss based on qualified immunity is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p>Reading the Amended Complaint in the light most favorable to Heyne, Perry and Jones directed Manuel to enhance both the charges against and the discipline imposed on Heyne. Perry and Jones did so although they knew Heyne posed no danger to persons or property and was not disrupting the academic process, as evidenced by his returning to school nearly two days before Manuel suspended him. Like Manuel, they were aware that MNPS maintained statistics on student discipline, including the race of students subject to discipline. Perry and Jones were integrally involved in the decision-making process and ostensibly share responsibility with Manuel. Although the Amended Complaint is devoid of specific allegations of their personal bias against Heyne, their alleged integral involvement in the decision-making process is sufficient at this stage to make out a colorable claim against them. The Amended Complaint permits the conclusion that their impartiality, like Manuel's, was compromised.</p>\n<p>Taken as a whole and read in the light most favorable to Heyne, the Amended Complaint's factual allegations plausibly suggest that Perry and Jones were not impartial. For the reasons discussed above, the unlawfulness of their conduct at the time they acted was apparent, Heyne's right to procedural due process was clearly established at the time they acted, and reasonable officials in their alleged positions would have understood that their actions violated that right. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Goss,</i> 419 U.S. at 579-84, 95 S.Ct. 729; <i>Newsome,</i> 842 F.2d at 927; <i>Lamb,</i> 826 F.2d at 530; <i>Brewer by </i><i>Dreyfus,</i> 779 F.2d at 264; <i>Murray,</i> 472 F.2d at 443; <i>Gonzales,</i> 435 F.Supp. at 464. Therefore, we hold that Heyne has stated a claim against Perry and Jones under § 1983 for violating his right to procedural due process. The district court's denial of Perry's and Jones' motion to dismiss based on qualified immunity is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2.</h2>\n<p>\"The Due Process Clause ... sets only the floor or lowest level of procedures acceptable.\" <i>Flaim v.

In <i>Goss,</i> the Supreme Court stated that greater process for students than the procedures expressly identified was undesirable:</p>\n<blockquote>Brief disciplinary suspensions are almost countless. To impose in each such case even truncated trial-type procedures might well overwhelm administrative facilities in many places and, by diverting resources, cost more than it would save in educational effectiveness. Moreover, further formalizing the suspension process and escalating its formality and adversary nature may not only make it too costly as a regular disciplinary tool but also destroy its effectiveness as part of the teaching process.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Goss,</i> 419 U.S. at 583, 95 S.Ct. 729. Allowing students to state claims for procedural due process violations against officials participating in the type of process the Constitution does not require would further formalize the suspension process and increase its adversarial nature, two undesirable outcomes. <i>See id.</i></p>\n<p>The Amended Complaint alleges that Chambers and Thompson became involved in Heyne's disciplinary process only after the Disciplinary Hearing Board had affirmed Heyne's suspension. Heyne had no constitutional right to Disciplinary Hearing Board review of Manuel's decision and no constitutional right to appeal the Disciplinary Hearing Board's decision. <i>See </i><i>Williams ex rel. Allen,</i> 370 F.3d at 640-41; <i>Smith ex rel. Smith,</i> 129 F.3d at 429. Chambers' and Thompson's actions did not implicate and, therefore, could not have violated Heyne's right to procedural due process. <i>See </i><i>Laney,</i> 501 F.3d at 580 n. 2; <i>Williams ex rel. Allen,</i> 370 F.3d at 640-42; <i>Smith ex rel. Smith,</i> 129 F.3d at 429. Therefore, we hold that Heyne has failed to state a claim against Chambers and Thompson under § 1983 for violating his right to procedural due process. The district court's denial of Chambers' and Thompson's motion to dismiss based on qualified immunity is REVERSED.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C.</h2>\n<p>\"The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits a state from denying to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\" <i>S.S. v.

Heyne alleges that, before the incident with D.A., Manuel instructed the staff at Hillsboro to be more lenient in enforcing the Code of Conduct against African-American students. When Manuel gave that instruction, he was aware that MNPS maintained statistics on student discipline, including the race of students subject to discipline. Although Manuel was allegedly aware that D.A. had threatened Heyne's life in violation of the Code of Conduct, Manuel did not discipline D.A. Manuel increased Heyne's suspension from two days to ten days although Manuel knew that Heyne posed no danger to persons or property and was not disrupting the academic process, as evidenced by Heyne's returning to school nearly two days before the initial two-day suspension. Manuel allegedly admitted that he decided to suspend Heyne to \"cover\" himself and Hillsboro.</p>\n<p>Read in the light most favorable to Heyne, the Amended Complaint contains well-pled factual allegations we must accept as true suggesting that Manuel suspended Heyne for ten days based in part on Heyne's race. Heyne's factual allegations state a plausible claim against Manuel for violation of his right to equal protection. <i>See </i><i>McLaurin v. Okla.

Heyne's right not to be disciplined based on his race was clearly established at the time of Manuel's actions. <i>See </i><i>McLaurin,</i> 339 U.S. at 642, 70 S.Ct. 851; <i>Buchanan,</i> 99 F.3d at 1360. Therefore, we hold that Heyne has stated a claim against Manuel under § 1983 for violating his right to equal protection. The district court's denial of Manuel's motion to dismiss based on qualified immunity is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p>Heyne alleges that Perry and Jones directed Manuel to suspend him. As evidenced by Heyne's returning to school nearly two days before Manuel suspended him, Perry and Jones acted although they knew Heyne posed no danger to persons or property and was not disrupting the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*572</span> academic process. MNPS maintained statistics about the race of students involved in disciplinary incidents, and Manuel punished Heyne but did not punish D.A., contrary to the Code of Conduct. Perry's and Jones' order to suspend Heyne affected the racial statistics MNPS maintained.</p>\n<p>Reading the Amended Complaint in the light most favorable to Heyne and drawing reasonable inferences in his favor, Perry and Jones ordered Manuel to punish Heyne in part because of Heyne's race.

The district court's denial of Perry's and Jones' motion to dismiss based on qualified immunity is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p>Heyne has offered no well-pled factual allegations that Chambers or Thompson considered Heyne's race. He alleges that they participated in the unfair denial of Heyne's appeal of the Disciplinary Hearing Board's decision. Even if true, Heyne has not alleged that his race motivated their actions. None of his allegations constitutes direct or circumstantial evidence that Chambers or Thompson discriminated or intended to discriminate against Heyne because of his race. Heyne does assert that Chambers and Thompson violated his equal protection rights. That allegation is a legal conclusion that we need not accept as true. <i>See </i><i>Jones,</i> 521 F.3d at 559.

MAYS, JR., District Judge.</p>\n<p>Defendant Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County, Tennessee (\"Metropolitan Government\") and individual Defendants Rod Manuel, Fran Perry, Mary Chambers, Alvin Jones, and Ralph Thompson (\"Individual Defendants\") (collectively, \"Defendants\") appeal the order of the district court denying their motions to dismiss Plaintiff Christian Heyne's (\"Heyne\") Amended Complaint. In the Amended Complaint, Heyne seeks relief under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging that Defendants violated his right to procedural due process and equal protection when he was suspended from his high school for ten days. For the following reasons, we AFFIRM IN PART and REVERSE IN PART the district court's order.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>This dispute stems from Heyne's dissatisfaction with a ten-day suspension he received from Defendant Metropolitan Nashville Public Schools (\"MNPS\").<sup>[1]</sup> Heyne, a Caucasian, was a senior at Hillsboro High School (\"Hillsboro\") in Nashville, Tennessee, and played on Hillsboro's football team. On Friday, September 5, 2008, after football practice, Heyne and other players congregated in the narrow parking lot behind the locker room without adult supervision. D.A., an African-American student who played on the football team, stood with other players in the road leading to the exit from the parking lot. Heyne got into his car and drove along the road toward the exit. All of the students standing in the road except D.A. moved out of the way as Heyne approached. Heyne believed D.A. was standing far enough to the side of the road to allow him to continue driving. As Heyne approached the exit, the left front tire of his car made contact with D.A.'s foot, causing D.A. to fall backward and suffer, at most, a bruised or sprained ankle. Heyne put his car in reverse, got out, and apologized to D.A. In response, D.A. threatened to kill him.</p>\n<p>The MNPS Code of Conduct (\"Code of Conduct\") governs student conduct and discipline at Hillsboro. MNPS maintains statistics on student discipline, including the race of students subject to discipline. Before the incident between Heyne and D.A., Rod Manuel (\"Manuel\"), the Principal <span class=\"star-pagination\">*560</span> at Hillsboro, had instructed the staff at a meeting to be more lenient in enforcing the Code of Conduct against African-American students because too many African-American students were serving in-school suspensions.</p>\n<p>After the incident, D.A. and some of his friends immediately walked to Manuel's office to report what had happened. After meeting with D.A. and his friends, Manuel did not meet with any other witnesses and did not visit the scene of the incident. Although the Code of Conduct prohibits threats by students, Manuel did not discipline D.A. for threatening Heyne's life. Soon afterward, D.A.'s parents threatened to sue Hillsboro and demanded compensation from Heyne, his parents, and their insurance carrier. At some point, Manuel admitted that he decided to suspend Heyne to \"cover\" himself and Hillsboro, presumably from liability for the incident.</p>\n<p>Heyne returned to school on Monday, September 8, 2008. His only restriction was that he was not permitted to operate a car on campus. On the afternoon of Tuesday, September 9, Manuel charged Heyne with reckless endangerment under the Code of Conduct and summarily suspended him for two days. Fran Perry (\"Perry\"), the Discipline Coordinator for MNPS, and Alvin Jones (\"Jones\"), the Director of Attendance and Discipline for MNPS, allegedly directed Manuel to suspend Heyne. On Thursday, September 11, Manuel, allegedly at the direction of Perry and Jones, charged Heyne with two additional Code of Conduct violations, using an object in an assaultive manner and cruelty to a student, increased his suspension to ten days, and referred the matter to the Disciplinary Hearing Board of MNPS. The Amended Complaint does not state whether, before suspending Heyne initially for two days or increasing his suspension to ten days, Manuel explained the evidence against Heyne or offered him the opportunity to present his side of the story.</p>\n<p>Before the hearing, Heyne submitted written materials, including witness statements, for consideration by the Disciplinary Hearing Board. Those materials were not provided to Disciplinary Hearing Board panelists until they arrived at the hearing. In the notice of the hearing, MNPS implied that Heyne could be represented by an attorney at the proceeding if he followed certain steps, and Heyne hired an attorney. Nevertheless, Perry informed Heyne's attorney immediately before the hearing that he could not participate beyond passing notes to Heyne and his parents. Heyne was not allowed to present witnesses on his own behalf, although several MNPS employees had planned to testify for him. They were informed by Manuel that they would lose their jobs if they attended the hearing. The Amended Complaint does not state whether they attended.</p>\n<p>The Disciplinary Hearing Board met on September 23, 2008, to review the charges against Heyne. By then, he had served his ten-day suspension. Perry participated in the Disciplinary Hearing Board's deliberations, which were closed to Heyne, his parents, and his attorney. Perry was not a member of the Disciplinary Hearing Board, and the Code of Conduct provides that non-members cannot attend the Board's deliberations. The Disciplinary Hearing Board sustained the charge of reckless endangerment against Heyne and affirmed his suspension for ten days, allowing it to remain part of his permanent school record. Before affirming that charge, the Board refused to allow Heyne's counsel to explain the elements of reckless endangerment. The charges for using an object in an assaultive manner and cruelty to a student were dismissed. At some point during the hearing, the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*561</span> Disciplinary Hearing Board stated on the record that Heyne did not intend to hit D.A. and did not intend any act of cruelty toward a fellow student.</p>\n<p>The Code of Conduct allowed Heyne to appeal the Disciplinary Hearing Board's decision to the Director of MNPS, and he did so. The Code of Conduct permitted the Director of MNPS to delegate responsibility for deciding appeals. Chris Henson, the Interim Director of MNPS, designated Mary Chambers (\"Chambers\"), an employee in the Disciplinary Office of MNPS, to hear Heyne's appeal. Chambers worked in the same chain of command as Perry. In deciding Heyne's appeal, Chambers refused to consider an affidavit submitted on Heyne's behalf by the Hillsboro football team's orthopedic physician stating that D.A.'s injuries were minor and that Heyne had not endangered D.A. Chambers consulted with Ralph Thompson (\"Thompson\"), the Assistant Superintendent for Student Services for MNPS, Perry, Manuel, and an attorney for MNPS. Chambers ultimately denied the appeal. Pursuant to the Code of Conduct, Heyne appealed to the MNPS Board of Public Education, which had discretion to hear his appeal. The Board declined Heyne's request for a hearing and affirmed the suspension.</p>\n<p>Heyne graduated from Hillsboro in 2009. Before his suspension, several college recruiters had approached him about playing football on scholarship, and Congressman Jim Cooper had offered him a congressional appointment, the first step required to attend one of the United States military service academies. Because of the suspension, Heyne allegedly lost the opportunity to receive a scholarship because he missed two football games and his suspension was listed on his permanent school record. He also allegedly lost the opportunity to apply to the United States military service academies.</p>\n<p>On September 4, 2009, Heyne filed a complaint against MNPS, Manuel, Perry, Chambers, Jones, and Thompson in the Chancery Court of Tennessee for the 20th Judicial District at Nashville, Tennessee. Heyne amended his Complaint on September 10, 2009, adding the Metropolitan Government and the MNPS Board of Public Education as defendants. In the Amended Complaint, Heyne sought relief under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for (1) procedural due process violations by Defendants, (2) substantive due process violations by Defendants, (3) equal protection violations by Defendants, and (4) failure to train and supervise by the Metropolitan Government. Heyne also sought relief for state law negligence. Defendants subsequently removed the case to the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee under 28 U.S.C. § 1441. The Individual Defendants, the Metropolitan Government, and the Metropolitan Board of Public Education filed motions to dismiss. The district court granted their motions in part and dismissed Heyne's claims for substantive due process violations, failure to train, and negligence. The district court also dismissed Heyne's parents' claims, his claims against Individual Defendants in their official capacities, and his claims against MNPS and the Metropolitan Board of Public Education.</p>\n<p>The Metropolitan Government and the Individual Defendants appeal the district court's conclusions on the remaining parts of their motions to dismiss. The Individual Defendants assert that Heyne failed to state a § 1983 claim on which relief can be granted because they are entitled to qualified immunity. The Metropolitan Government asserts that Heyne has failed to plead facts stating a plausible claim for violation of his constitutional rights. The district court rejected those assertions. The district court concluded that Heyne had stated a claim for violation of his <span class=\"star-pagination\">*562</span> procedural due process and equal protection rights and that the Individual Defendants were not entitled to qualified immunity.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>Because Heyne brings suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and alleges that Defendants violated his constitutional rights, the district court had original jurisdiction and removal was proper. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1441; <i>Hadix v.

Before the incident between Heyne, a Caucasian, and D.A., an African-American, Manuel allegedly instructed the staff at Hillsboro to be more lenient in enforcing the Code of Conduct against African-American students. At some point Manuel also allegedly admitted that he decided to suspend Heyne to \"cover\" himself and Hillsboro, presumably from liability for the incident in the face of a threatened lawsuit by D.A.'s parents. Manuel did not discipline D.A. for his threat to Heyne although the Code of Conduct prohibits threats by students. Before suspending Heyne, Manuel was aware that MNPS maintained statistics on student discipline, including the race of students subject to discipline.</p>\n<p>Taken as a whole, the Amended Complaint's factual allegations, which we must accept as true, plausibly suggest that Manuel's ability to impartially determine the appropriate discipline in relation to the September 5, 2008 incident had been manifestly compromised  by virtue of his knowledge of and expressed concern about student discipline statistics, his instructions to faculty and staff concerning discipline of African-American students, and his reaction to communications with the parents of D.A. These are the kinds of specific facts, indicating the presence of pre-existing bias, that this Court has recognized could give rise to a valid claim for infringement of the due process right to an impartial decisionmaker in the context of student discipline. <i>Newsome,</i> 842 F.2d at 927, n. 5. Viewing the allegations in the light most favorable to plaintiff Heyne, as we must, we conclude that a reasonable school official in Manuel's alleged position should have known that his impartiality was compromised and that his participation in the discipline decision-making process was not permissible. The impropriety of Manuel's alleged conduct in failing to disqualify himself should have been apparent based on <i>Goss, Newsome,</i> and other precedent directly on point. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Goss,</i> 419 U.S. at 579-84, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109136\"><a href=\"/opinion/109136/goss-v-lopez/\"><span class=\"volume\">95</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The district court's denial of Manuel's motion to dismiss based on qualified immunity is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p>Reading the Amended Complaint in the light most favorable to Heyne, Perry and Jones directed Manuel to enhance both the charges against and the discipline imposed on Heyne. Perry and Jones did so although they knew Heyne posed no danger to persons or property and was not disrupting the academic process, as evidenced by his returning to school nearly two days before Manuel suspended him. Like Manuel, they were aware that MNPS maintained statistics on student discipline, including the race of students subject to discipline. Perry and Jones were integrally involved in the decision-making process and ostensibly share responsibility with Manuel. Although the Amended Complaint is devoid of specific allegations of their personal bias against Heyne, their alleged integral involvement in the decision-making process is sufficient at this stage to make out a colorable claim against them. The Amended Complaint permits the conclusion that their impartiality, like Manuel's, was compromised.</p>\n<p>Taken as a whole and read in the light most favorable to Heyne, the Amended Complaint's factual allegations plausibly suggest that Perry and Jones were not impartial. For the reasons discussed above, the unlawfulness of their conduct at the time they acted was apparent, Heyne's right to procedural due process was clearly established at the time they acted, and reasonable officials in their alleged positions would have understood that their actions violated that right. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Goss,</i> 419 U.S. at 579-84, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109136\"><a href=\"/opinion/109136/goss-v-lopez/\"><span class=\"volume\">95</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In <i>Goss,</i> the Supreme Court stated that greater process for students than the procedures expressly identified was undesirable:</p>\n<blockquote>Brief disciplinary suspensions are almost countless. To impose in each such case even truncated trial-type procedures might well overwhelm administrative facilities in many places and, by diverting resources, cost more than it would save in educational effectiveness.

Heyne alleges that, before the incident with D.A., Manuel instructed the staff at Hillsboro to be more lenient in enforcing the Code of Conduct against African-American students. When Manuel gave that instruction, he was aware that MNPS maintained statistics on student discipline, including the race of students subject to discipline. Although Manuel was allegedly aware that D.A. had threatened Heyne's life in violation of the Code of Conduct, Manuel did not discipline D.A. Manuel increased Heyne's suspension from two days to ten days although Manuel knew that Heyne posed no danger to persons or property and was not disrupting the academic process, as evidenced by Heyne's returning to school nearly two days before the initial two-day suspension. Manuel allegedly admitted that he decided to suspend Heyne to \"cover\" himself and Hillsboro.</p>\n<p>Read in the light most favorable to Heyne, the Amended Complaint contains well-pled factual allegations we must accept as true suggesting that Manuel suspended Heyne for ten days based in part on Heyne's race. Heyne's factual allegations state a plausible claim against Manuel for violation of his right to equal protection. <i>See </i><i>McLaurin v. Okla.

The district court's denial of Perry's and Jones' motion to dismiss based on qualified immunity is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p>Heyne has offered no well-pled factual allegations that Chambers or Thompson considered Heyne's race. He alleges that they participated in the unfair denial of Heyne's appeal of the Disciplinary Hearing Board's decision. Even if true, Heyne has not alleged that his race motivated their actions. None of his allegations constitutes direct or circumstantial evidence that Chambers or Thompson discriminated or intended to discriminate against Heyne because of his race. Heyne does assert that Chambers and Thompson violated his equal protection rights. That allegation is a legal conclusion that we need not accept as true. <i>See </i><i>Jones,</i> 521 F.3d at 559. We hold that Heyne has failed to state a claim against Chambers and Thompson under § 1983 for violating his right to equal protection. The district court's denial of Chambers' and Thompson's motion to dismiss based on qualified immunity is REVERSED.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>The Metropolitan Government argues on appeal that Heyne has failed to state a plausible procedural due process or equal protection claim. Based on the prior analysis, the Metropolitan Government's argument is not well-taken as to Manuel, Perry, and Jones. The district court's denial of the Metropolitan Government's motion to dismiss Heyne's procedural due process and equal protection claims based on the conduct of Manuel, Perry, and Jones is AFFIRMED. However, the Metropolitan Government's argument is well-taken as to Chambers and Thompson based on the prior analysis.
