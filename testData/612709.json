The district court denied his motion to suppress\nevidence obtained during a residential search. He pled guilty on all counts and was\n\n\n\n                                          1\n\fNo. 09-6461         United States v. Johnson                                         Page 2\n\n\nsentenced to 45 months in prison. He now appeals the district court’s denial of his\nmotion to suppress. Because the evidence was fruit of an unreasonable search, we\nREVERSE.\n\n                                             I.\n\n        On October 30, 2007, four law enforcement officers conducted a “knock and\ntalk” at 220 Benefield Avenue (“the residence”) in Smyrna, Tennessee. They went to\nthe residence to investigate a tip that they received from an anonymous caller indicating\nthat residents at the address possessed marijuana and a firearm. At the time of the knock\nand talk, the home was owned by Angela Rawls, who is the Defendant’s mother-in-law.\nRawls lived in the home with her mother, Maudie Conerly, and her daughter, Karen\nJohnson (the Defendant’s wife) (“Karen”), along with several children. Although the\nDefendant and Karen had been separated for some time, he had been staying with her\nintermittently at the residence since May 2007.\n\n        When the officers knocked, Conerly answered the door. The officers explained\nthe purpose of their visit and told her that they would like to search the house. When\nthey asked who else was home, Conerly said that Karen was in the back bedroom with\nher husband (the Defendant), and that Rawls was sick in her bed. Karen and the\nDefendant emerged from the bedroom and came into the living room. The police asked\nwho lived at the residence, and it is undisputed that Conerly and Karen indicated that\nthey lived there. The Defendant’s response is disputed.\n\n        According to the Defendant, he told the police that he, too, lived at the residence.\nHe further claims that he expressly objected to a search. The police officers testified that\nthe Defendant stated that he did not live at the residence, but that he “came and went”\nfreely to visit his children. They further testified that he did not object to a search. Two\nof the officers took Conerly and Karen outside and obtained formal consent forms from\nthem authorizing a search of the home. The Defendant claims that he again objected to\nthe search when everyone came back inside. The police maintain that he never objected.\n\fNo. 09-6461        United States v. Johnson                                         Page 3\n\n\n       Before the police started their search, Karen voluntarily turned over a small\namount of marijuana from her dresser drawer. Detective Weaver then began to search\nthe bedroom that Karen shared with the Defendant. In the bedroom, Weaver found a\nhandgun, counterfeit money, 100 grams of marijuana, digital scales, computer\nequipment, and some media storage devices, all of which belonged to the Defendant.\n\n       On September 17, 2008, a grand jury returned a seven-count indictment charging\nthe Defendant with possessing counterfeit securities, producing and possessing false\nidentification documents, and aggravated identity theft. The Defendant moved to\nsuppress the evidence found during the search of the residence, and the district court\ndenied his motion after an evidentiary hearing. He pled guilty to all seven counts of the\nindictment, but his plea agreement preserved his right to appeal the denial of his motion\nto suppress. The district court sentenced the Defendant to 21 months in prison on counts\none through six and a mandatory consecutive 24 months in prison on count seven.\n\n       The Defendant filed this timely appeal in which he challenges the district court’s\ndenial of his motion to suppress.\n\n                                            II.\n\n       “When reviewing the denial of a motion to suppress, we review the district\ncourt’s findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo.” United States\nv. Gross, 624 F.3d 309, 314 (6th Cir. 2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). We\nconstrue the evidence in the light most favorable to the government. Id.\n\n       The district court determined that the Defendant objected to the search before the\npolice searched the bedroom. However, the court held that his objection was invalid\nbecause the Defendant was not a full-time resident of the home and his possessory\ninterest was therefore inferior to that of Karen and Conerly, who lived there full-time.\nOn appeal, the Defendant argues that the district court misapplied the law when it\ndetermined that his objection was invalid.\n\fNo. 09-6461        United States v. Johnson                                         Page 4\n\n\n                                            A.\n\n       The Fourth Amendment prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures. A search\nconducted without a warrant is unreasonable unless it falls within an exception to the\nwarrant requirement. United States v. Ayoub, 498 F.3d 532, 537 (6th Cir. 2007). One\nsuch exception is voluntary consent from an individual possessing authority. Georgia\nv. Randolph, 547 U.S. 103, 109 (2006). That person may be the one against whom\nevidence is sought, or it may be a co-occupant who shares common authority over the\npremises. Id. “[T]he exception for consent extends even to entries and searches with\nthe permission of a co-occupant whom the police reasonably, but erroneously, believe\nto possess shared authority as an occupant.” Id. (citation omitted). However, in\nsituations where one co-tenant consents to a search but another, physically present co-\ntenant expressly refuses consent, a warrantless search is not reasonable as to the\nobjecting co-tenant. Id. at 120.\n\n       In Randolph, the defendant’s wife called the police and complained that her\nhusband had taken their son away after a domestic dispute. Id. at 107. When the police\narrived, she also told them that her husband was using drugs, that his drug use had\ncaused marital problems, and that she had just recently returned to the home after an\nabsence of several weeks. Id. The husband arrived a little later, and the police asked for\nhis consent to search the house, which he denied. Id. They then asked the wife for\nconsent, which she gave, and they searched the home. Id. The Supreme Court held that\nthe search was unreasonable as to the husband because “a physically present inhabitant’s\nexpress refusal of consent to a police search is dispositive as to him, regardless of the\nconsent of a fellow occupant.” Id. at 122-23. The Court explained its holding by\nreference to commonly held social understandings that one co-tenant generally does not\nhave authority over another. See id. at 113-14 (“[T]here is no common understanding\nthat one co-tenant generally has a right or authority to prevail over the express wishes\nof another, whether the issue is the color of the curtains or invitations to outsiders.”).\n\fNo. 09-6461         United States v. Johnson                                          Page 5\n\n\n                                             B.\n\n        The district court interpreted this court’s decision in Ayoub, 498 F.3d 532, as\n“drawing a distinction [after Randolph] between superior possessory and privacy\ninterest[s] and lesser possessory and privacy interests.” The district court stated that, “if\none has a lesser privacy interest, then even the presence and active objection to a search\nby that person with a lesser possessory interest is not a problem if [the police] have\nreceived consent to search from an individual with a superior possessory and privacy\ninterest.” However, we have drawn no such distinctions.\n\n        In Ayoub, 498 F.3d at 536, the police received a tip that the defendant was\nengaged in drug activity at his parents’ home. While the defendant’s parents were out\nof the country, police obtained consent to search from his half-sister. Id. She lived\nnearby, had a key to the home, and was taking care of it while the parents were away.\nId. The police did not seek consent from the defendant, even though they had observed\nhim coming and going from the home. Id. We held that the defendant’s half-sister had\nauthority to consent to the search and that, even if he had a superior possessory interest\nin the home, he “never cut off [his half-sister’s] authority to consent to the search.” Id.\nat 538-40.\n\n        The district court misconstrued Ayoub. Ayoub does say that someone with a\nlesser possessory interest can consent to a search when a person with a greater\npossessory interest is not present to refuse consent. Id. at 540-41. Further, Ayoub and\nother cases have affirmed the proposition that someone with a lesser possessory interest\ncannot consent to a search over the express objection of someone with a greater\npossessory interest. See id. at 538-39 (“When the primary occupant has denied\npermission to enter and conduct a search, his employee does not have the authority to\noverride that denial.” (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). This rule\nessentially accords with Randolph. Ayoub does not, however, say anything about the\nrelevant question in this case, which is whether consent to search from someone with a\nsuperior possessory interest invalidates an objection to a search from someone present\nwith a lesser possessory interest, rendering the search reasonable as to the objector.\n\fNo. 09-6461         United States v. Johnson                                          Page 6\n\n\n        There is no precedent addressing the question of whether Randolph’s holding\nrequires residential co-tenants to have equal possessory interests. However, Randolph\nitself suggests that the Court is not concerned with such distinctions. First, the Court\nnoted that its holding applies to all “residential co-occupancies,” notwithstanding the\nreality that the term may encompass a “multiplicity of living arrangements.” Randolph,\n547 U.S. at 109 n.2. The Court described the husband and wife in Randolph as co-\noccupants, even though the husband had been living at the home continuously, while the\nwife had only been there for a few days (and may not have intended to stay there). See\nid. at 106-07. If the Court was concerned with relative degrees of possessory interest\namong residential co-occupants, then the facts in Randolph certainly presented an\nopportunity to draw such distinctions. But the Court expressly avoided making those\ndistinctions, stating that, “Unless the people living together fall within some recognized\nhierarchy, like a household of parent and child or barracks housing military personnel\nof different grades, there is no societal understanding of superior and inferior . . . .” Id.\nat 114. And finally, the Court reached its holding by reference to general Fourth\nAmendment jurisprudence, in which the authority for “third-party consent does not rest\nupon the law of property, with its attendant historical and legal refinements, but rests\nrather on mutual use of the property by persons generally having joint access or control\nfor most purposes.” Id. at 110.\n\n                                             C.\n\n        In this case, there is no serious dispute that the Defendant had a reasonable\nexpectation of privacy in the bedroom, which he shared with his wife and which he used\nto store personal belongings. See Minnesota v. Olson, 495 U.S. 91, 98-99 (1990). The\ndistrict court found that the Defendant was present when the police arrived and that he\nexpressly objected to the search.       Accordingly, the search of the bedroom was\nunreasonable as to the Defendant. See Randolph, 547 U.S. at 120. Further, Randolph\ndoes not distinguish among the “multiplicity of living arrangements,” id. at 109 n.2, and\nthis particular arrangement of adult co-occupants—a grandmother-in-law, mother-in-\nlaw, wife, and husband—does not fall within any “recognized hierarchy,” see id. at 114.\n\fNo. 09-6461       United States v. Johnson                                   Page 7\n\n\nJohnson’s express objection to the search was sufficient to render the search of the\nbedroom unreasonable as to him, notwithstanding the consent given by Karen and\nConerly. See id. at 122-23.\n\n                                        III.\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we REVERSE the decision of the district court\ndenying the Defendant’s motion to suppress.\n\f",

The Court described the husband and wife in <i>Randolph</i> as co-occupants, even though the husband had been living at the home continuously, while the wife had only been there for a few days (and may not have intended to stay there). <i>See id.</i> at 106-07, 126 S.Ct. 1515. If the Court was concerned with relative degrees of possessory interest among residential co-occupants, then the facts in <i>Randolph</i> certainly presented an opportunity to draw such distinctions. But the Court expressly avoided making those distinctions, stating that, \"Unless the people living together fall within some recognized hierarchy, like a household of parent and child or barracks housing military personnel of different grades, there is no societal understanding of superior and inferior....\" <i>Id.</i> at 114, 126 S.Ct. 1515. And finally, the Court reached its holding by <span class=\"star-pagination\">*379</span> reference to general Fourth Amendment jurisprudence, in which the authority for \"third-party consent does not rest upon the law of property, with its attendant historical and legal refinements, but rests rather on mutual use of the property by persons generally having joint access or control for most purposes.\" <i>Id.</i> at 110, 126 S.Ct. 1515.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C.</h2>\n<p>In this case, there is no serious dispute that the Defendant had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the bedroom, which he shared with his wife and which he used to store personal belongings. <i>See </i><i>Minnesota v. Olson,</i> 495 U.S. 91, 98-99, 110 S.Ct. 1684, 109 L.Ed.2d 85 (1990). The district court found that the Defendant was present when the police arrived and that he expressly objected to the search. Accordingly, the search of the bedroom was unreasonable as to the Defendant. <i>See </i><i>Randolph,</i> 547 U.S. at 120, 126 S.Ct. 1515. Further, <i>Randolph</i> does not distinguish among the \"multiplicity of living arrangements,\" <i>id.</i> at 109 n. 2, 126 S.Ct. 1515, and this particular arrangement of adult co-occupants  a grandmother-in-law, mother-in-law, wife, and husband  does not fall within any \"recognized hierarchy,\" <i>see id.</i> at 114, 126 S.Ct. 1515. Johnson's express objection to the search was sufficient to render the search of the bedroom unreasonable as to him, notwithstanding the consent given by Karen and Conerly. <i>See id.</i> at 122-23, 126 S.Ct. 1515.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, we REVERSE the decision of the district court denying the Defendant's motion to suppress.</p>\n</div>",

ON BRIEF: Anne-Marie Moyes, Jude Lenahan, Federal Public Defender's Office, Nashville, Tennessee, for Appellant. Darryl A. Stewart, Assistant United States Attorney, Nashville, Tennessee, for Appellee.</p>\n<p>Before: BATCHELDER, Chief Judge; BOGGS and WHITE, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>OPINION</h2>\n<p>ALICE M. BATCHELDER, Chief Judge.</p>\n<p>Defendant-Appellant Lanerrick Johnson was charged with several counts of possessing counterfeit securities and fraudulent identification documents. The district court denied his motion to suppress evidence obtained during a residential search. He pled guilty on all counts and was sentenced to 45 months in prison. He now appeals the district court's denial of his motion to suppress. Because the evidence was fruit of an unreasonable search, we REVERSE.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>On October 30, 2007, four law enforcement officers conducted a \"knock and talk\" at 220 Benefield Avenue (\"the residence\") in Smyrna, Tennessee. They went to the residence to investigate a tip that they received from an anonymous caller indicating that residents at the address possessed marijuana and a firearm. At the time of the knock and talk, the home was owned by Angela Rawls, who is the Defendant's mother-in-law. Rawls lived in the home with her mother, Maudie Conerly, and her daughter, Karen Johnson (the Defendant's wife) (\"Karen\"), along with several children. Although the Defendant and Karen had been separated for some time, he had been staying with her intermittently at the residence since May 2007.</p>\n<p>When the officers knocked, Conerly answered the door. The officers explained the purpose of their visit and told her that they would like to search the house. When they asked who else was home, Conerly said that Karen was in the back bedroom with her husband (the Defendant), and that Rawls was sick in her bed. Karen and the Defendant emerged from the bedroom and came into the living room. The police asked who lived at the residence, and it is undisputed that Conerly and Karen indicated that they lived there. The Defendant's response is disputed.</p>\n<p>According to the Defendant, he told the police that he, too, lived at the residence. He further claims that he expressly objected to a search. The police officers testified that the Defendant stated that he did <i>not</i> live at the residence, but that he \"came and went\" freely to visit his children. They further testified that he did not object to a search. Two of the officers took Conerly and Karen outside and obtained formal consent forms from them authorizing a search of the home. The Defendant claims that he again objected to the search when everyone came back inside. The police maintain that he never objected.</p>\n<p>Before the police started their search, Karen voluntarily turned over a small amount of marijuana from her dresser drawer. Detective Weaver then began to search the bedroom that Karen shared with the Defendant. In the bedroom, Weaver found a handgun, counterfeit money, 100 grams of marijuana, digital scales, computer equipment, and some media storage devices, all of which belonged to the Defendant.</p>\n<p>On September 17, 2008, a grand jury returned a seven-count indictment charging the Defendant with possessing counterfeit securities, producing and possessing <span class=\"star-pagination\">*377</span> false identification documents, and aggravated identity theft. The Defendant moved to suppress the evidence found during the search of the residence, and the district court denied his motion after an evidentiary hearing. He pled guilty to all seven counts of the indictment, but his plea agreement preserved his right to appeal the denial of his motion to suppress. The district court sentenced the Defendant to 21 months in prison on counts one through six and a mandatory consecutive 24 months in prison on count seven.</p>\n<p>The Defendant filed this timely appeal in which he challenges the district court's denial of his motion to suppress.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>\"When reviewing the denial of a motion to suppress, we review the district court's findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law <i>de novo.</i>\" <i>United States v. Gross,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">624</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">309</span></span>, 314 (6th Cir.2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). We construe the evidence in the light most favorable to the government. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>The district court determined that the Defendant objected to the search before the police searched the bedroom. However, the court held that his objection was invalid because the Defendant was not a full-time resident of the home and his possessory interest was therefore inferior to that of Karen and Conerly, who lived there full-time. On appeal, the Defendant argues that the district court misapplied the law when it determined that his objection was invalid.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A.</h2>\n<p>The Fourth Amendment prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures. A search conducted without a warrant is unreasonable unless it falls within an exception to the warrant requirement. <i>United States v. Ayoub,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1289889\"><a href=\"/opinion/1289889/united-states-v-ayoub/\"><span class=\"volume\">498</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">532</span></a></span>, 537 (6th Cir.2007). One such exception is voluntary consent from an individual possessing authority. <i>Georgia v. Randolph,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145669\"><a href=\"/opinion/145669/georgia-v-randolph/\"><span class=\"volume\">547</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">103</span></a></span>, 109, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145669\"><a href=\"/opinion/145669/georgia-v-randolph/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">208</span></a></span> (2006). That person may be the one against whom evidence is sought, or it may be a co-occupant who shares common authority over the premises. <i>Id.</i> \"[T]he exception for consent extends even to entries and searches with the permission of a co-occupant whom the police reasonably, but erroneously, believe to possess shared authority as an occupant.\" <i>Id.</i> (citation omitted). However, in situations where one co-tenant consents to a search but another, physically present co-tenant expressly refuses consent, a warrantless search is not reasonable as to the objecting co-tenant. <i>Id.</i> at 120, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145669\"><a href=\"/opinion/145669/georgia-v-randolph/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1515</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>In <i>Randolph,</i> the defendant's wife called the police and complained that her husband had taken their son away after a domestic dispute. <i>Id.</i> at 107, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145669\"><a href=\"/opinion/145669/georgia-v-randolph/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1515</span></a></span>. When the police arrived, she also told them that her husband was using drugs, that his drug use had caused marital problems, and that she had just recently returned to the home after an absence of several weeks. <i>Id.</i> The husband arrived a little later, and the police asked for his consent to search the house, which he denied. <i>Id.</i> They then asked the wife for consent, which she gave, and they searched the home. <i>Id.</i> The Supreme Court held that the search was unreasonable as to the husband because \"a physically present inhabitant's express refusal of consent to a police search is dispositive as to him, regardless of the consent of a fellow occupant.\" <i>Id.</i> at 122-23, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145669\"><a href=\"/opinion/145669/georgia-v-randolph/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1515</span></a></span>. The Court explained its holding by reference to commonly held social understandings that one co-tenant generally does not have authority over another. <i>See id.</i> at 113-14, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145669\"><a href=\"/opinion/145669/georgia-v-randolph/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1515</span></a></span> (\"[T]here is no common understanding that one co-tenant generally has a right or authority to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*378</span> prevail over the express wishes of another, whether the issue is the color of the curtains or invitations to outsiders.\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B.</h2>\n<p>The district court interpreted this court's decision in <i>Ayoub,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1289889\"><a href=\"/opinion/1289889/united-states-v-ayoub/\"><span class=\"volume\">498</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">532</span></a></span>, as \"drawing a distinction [after <i>Randolph</i>] between superior possessory and privacy interest[s] and lesser possessory and privacy interests.\" The district court stated that, \"if one has a lesser privacy interest, then even the presence and active objection to a search by that person with a lesser possessory interest is not a problem if [the police] have received consent to search from an individual with a superior possessory and privacy interest.\" However, we have drawn no such distinctions.</p>\n<p>In <i>Ayoub,</i> 498 F.3d at 536, the police received a tip that the defendant was engaged in drug activity at his parents' home. While the defendant's parents were out of the country, police obtained consent to search from his half-sister. <i>Id.</i> She lived nearby, had a key to the home, and was taking care of it while the parents were away. <i>Id.</i> The police did not seek consent from the defendant, even though they had observed him coming and going from the home. <i>Id.</i> We held that the defendant's half-sister had authority to consent to the search and that, even if he had a superior possessory interest in the home, he \"never cut off [his half-sister's] authority to consent to the search.\" <i>Id.</i> at 538-40.</p>\n<p>The district court misconstrued <i>Ayoub. Ayoub</i> does say that someone with a lesser possessory interest can consent to a search when a person with a greater possessory interest is not present to refuse consent. <i>Id.</i> at 540-41. Further, <i>Ayoub</i> and other cases have affirmed the proposition that someone with a lesser possessory interest cannot consent to a search over the express objection of someone with a greater possessory interest. <i>See id.</i> at 538-39 (\"When the primary occupant has denied permission to enter and conduct a search, his employee does not have the authority to override that denial.\" (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). This rule essentially accords with <i>Randolph. Ayoub</i> does not, however, say anything about the relevant question in this case, which is whether consent to search from someone with a superior possessory interest invalidates an objection to a search from someone present with a lesser possessory interest, rendering the search reasonable as to the objector.</p>\n<p>There is no precedent addressing the question of whether <i>Randolph</i>'s holding requires residential co-tenants to have equal possessory interests. However, <i>Randolph</i> itself suggests that the Court is not concerned with such distinctions. First, the Court noted that its holding applies to all \"residential co-occupancies,\" notwithstanding the reality that the term may encompass a \"multiplicity of living arrangements.\" <i>Randolph,</i> 547 U.S. at 109 n. 2, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145669\"><a href=\"/opinion/145669/georgia-v-randolph/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The Court described the husband and wife in <i>Randolph</i> as co-occupants, even though the husband had been living at the home continuously, while the wife had only been there for a few days (and may not have intended to stay there). <i>See id.</i> at 106-07, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145669\"><a href=\"/opinion/145669/georgia-v-randolph/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

And finally, the Court reached its holding by <span class=\"star-pagination\">*379</span> reference to general Fourth Amendment jurisprudence, in which the authority for \"third-party consent does not rest upon the law of property, with its attendant historical and legal refinements, but rests rather on mutual use of the property by persons generally having joint access or control for most purposes.\" <i>Id.</i> at 110, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145669\"><a href=\"/opinion/145669/georgia-v-randolph/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.
