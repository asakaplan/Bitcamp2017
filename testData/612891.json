After her arrest and incarceration\nas a witness in a criminal proceeding, LaTasha Adams (“Adams”) brought suit in the\nUnited States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan pursuant to 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1983 against Karen Hanson (“Hanson”), an assistant prosecutor in Genesee County,\nMichigan, in her individual capacity. Hanson subpoenaed Adams to testify in state court\n\n\n                                          1\n\fNo. 09-2045        Adams v. Hanson                                                  Page 2\n\n\nduring the preliminary examination of a criminal defendant. When Adams arrived at the\nstate courthouse, she and Hanson spoke about her possible testimony, and after their\ndiscussions, Hanson informed the trial court that Adams was unwilling to testify. The\ncourt ordered Adams detained based on Hanson’s representations without providing\nAdams an opportunity to be heard or to post bond.\n\n       In her federal § 1983 suit, Adams claims that she was unlawfully detained for\ntwelve days as a result of Hanson’s false and misleading representations to the state trial\ncourt regarding Adams’s availability as a witness. The district court granted Hanson’s\nmotion for summary judgment on the grounds that Hanson is entitled to absolute\nimmunity for conduct falling within her role as a prosecutor. Adams appeals, arguing\nthat Hanson acted as a complaining witness or, in the alternative, fulfilled an\nadministrative function. The American Civil Liberties Union Fund of Michigan filed an\namicus brief arguing that absolute immunity should not protect prosecutors from suits\nfiled by third-party witnesses.\n\n       When making statements at a preliminary examination about the availability of\na witness, Hanson functioned as an advocate for the State of Michigan and performed\nacts intimately associated with the judicial process. Because she is absolutely immune\nfrom suit for her prosecutorial conduct, we AFFIRM the district court’s grant of\nsummary judgment to Hanson.\n\n                                  I. BACKGROUND\n\n       Hanson, an assistant prosecutor, subpoenaed Adams to testify in a preliminary\nexamination in a gang-related racketeering case in state court. One of the defendants\ncharged in the case was Marquan Cager (“Cager”), the father of one of Adams’s\nchildren. In 2006, Adams had filed a domestic violence complaint against Cager and\nprovided a statement to investigating officers describing Cager’s involvement in gang-\nrelated murders and drug-trafficking activities. When Cager was charged with crimes\ndescribed in Adams’s statement, Hanson authorized a subpoena compelling Adams to\n\fNo. 09-2045            Adams v. Hanson                                                            Page 3\n\n\nappear in court at a preliminary examination in order to testify about her knowledge of\nthe criminal enterprise.\n\n         Law-enforcement officers served the subpoena on Adams at her home the\nmorning she was set to appear at the preliminary examination. Adams, who was six-\nand-a-half-months pregnant, arrived at the courthouse that afternoon and met with law-\nenforcement personnel. She was then taken to meet Hanson, who provided her with a\ncopy of a report that documented her statements about Cager’s criminal activity.\n\n         Hanson advised Adams to review the report. She also told Adams that she would\nreturn in about an hour and a half to bring Adams into the courtroom to testify in\nconformity with her prior statements. Adams responded that she did not want to testify\nand that she was under a doctor’s care due to a high-risk pregnancy. When Hanson\nreturned, Adams repeated her refusal to testify. Adams informed Hanson that she was\nnot going to testify in conformity with the report because she had not made the\nstatements attributed to her and the statements were not true.1\n\n         According to Adams, Hanson returned to the courtroom and advised the judge,\noff the record, that Adams would not testify in accordance with the report, and that she\nshould be held in contempt. Based on the information provided by Hanson, the trial\njudge signed a mittimus directing that Adams be held in jail until further order of the\ncourt. After the judge signed the mittimus, two sheriff’s deputies confronted Adams and\nasked her if she was going to testify. When she informed them that she was not going\nto testify, she was handcuffed and taken to the Genesee County jail.\n\n         Adams was incarcerated for twelve days, during which she was allegedly held\nin isolation for twenty-three hours a day. Before she was detained, Adams was never\nbrought before the court and questioned about her willingness to testify or her ability to\nreturn to court to testify at a later date. She alleges that she was never given an\n\n\n\n         1\n          Adams described their ensuing exchange as “heated.” Denying that her behavior toward Adams\nwas confrontational, Hanson asserts that she gave Adams the option of testifying that her previous\nstatements were not true, but Adams flatly refused to appear in court and testify under any circumstances.\nFor purposes of summary judgment, however, Hanson stipulates to Adams’s version of the facts.\n\fNo. 09-2045        Adams v. Hanson                                                 Page 4\n\n\nopportunity to obtain counsel or post bond, and that she was never advised of the basis\nof her detention, of any right to be represented by counsel, or of any right to a hearing.\n\n       In the days following her arrest, Adams submitted a kite notifying the jail\nauthorities that she was willing to testify. In the meantime, however, the preliminary\nexamination had been continued. A week later, when proceedings resumed, Adams was\nbrought into the courtroom to testify, at which point several attorneys for the defendants\ndemanded an explanation for why she had been incarcerated. Hanson first explained that\nAdams was held for contempt of court, but after reviewing the mittimus ordering\nAdams’s arrest, she stated that Adams had been held, not for contempt, but as a material\nwitness, as indicated on the order. Adams was released from custody after she\ncompleted her substantive testimony.\n\n       Adams claims that Hanson sought to secure her detention in order to coerce her\ninto testifying, and that she was detained for contempt of court at Hanson’s suggestion.\nIn Hanson’s account, the trial judge ordered Adams held as a material witness and\ndirected Hanson and an officer from the sheriff’s department to write out a mittimus to\nthat effect.   Adams also asserts that Hanson made several false and misleading\nstatements in order to persuade the court to hold Adams. Hanson told the court that she\nhad been trying for three weeks to serve Adams with a subpoena, when efforts to serve\nAdams had been underway for only two weeks. Furthermore, Hanson failed to disclose\nto the court that Adams had been served with a subpoena only that morning and had\nappeared at the courthouse voluntarily the same day, which would have demonstrated\nto the court Adams’s willingness to comply with the court’s orders.\n\n       Adams subsequently brought suit against Hanson in federal district court\npursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for violations of her constitutional rights under the Fourth,\nFifth, and Fourteenth Amendments. Hanson filed a motion for summary judgment on\nthe basis of absolute prosecutorial immunity which the district court granted on May 28,\n2009. On July 22, 2009, the district court denied Adams’s motion for relief from the\norder of dismissal, construing it as a motion for reconsideration. Adams timely appealed\n\fNo. 09-2045        Adams v. Hanson                                                  Page 5\n\n\nfrom the district court’s opinion and order denying relief from the order of dismissal, and\nfrom the order granting Hanson’s motion for summary judgment.\n\n                                    II. ANALYSIS\n\nA. Standard of Review\n\n       We review de novo a district court’s grant of summary judgment, construing the\nevidence and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party. Ireland\nv. Tunis, 113 F.3d 1435, 1440 (6th Cir. 1997). Summary judgment is appropriate if\n“there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and . . . the movant is entitled to\njudgment as a matter of law.” FED. R. CIV. P. 56(c)(2) (2009). Hanson moved for\nsummary judgment, so we accept the facts as alleged by Adams and draw all reasonable\ninferences in her favor.\n\nB. Absolute Immunity\n\n       1. Functional Test\n\n       The district court granted summary judgment on the grounds that Hanson is\nentitled to absolute immunity. “Whether a defendant is entitled to absolute or qualified\nimmunity from liability under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 is a legal question that [we] review[] de\nnovo.” Moldowan v. City of Warren, 578 F.3d 351, 374 (6th Cir. 2009) (emphasis\nomitted). A government officer is entitled to absolute immunity for performing\nfunctions “intimately associated with the judicial phase of the criminal process.” Imbler\nv. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 409, 430 (1976). Hanson, as “the official seeking absolute\nimmunity[,] bears the burden of showing that such immunity is justified for the function\nin question.” Burns v. Reed, 500 U.S. 478, 486 (1991).\n\n       In Imbler, the Supreme Court extended absolute immunity to prosecutors sued\nfor damages under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, holding that a prosecutor is entitled to absolute\nimmunity when he acts “within the scope of his duties in initiating and pursuing a\ncriminal prosecution.” 424 U.S. at 410. Absolute immunity for prosecutorial duties is\njustified by the same considerations that supported prosecutorial immunity under the\n\fNo. 09-2045        Adams v. Hanson                                                  Page 6\n\n\ncommon law. These include “concern that harassment by unfounded litigation would\ncause a deflection of the prosecutor’s energies from his public duties, and the possibility\nthat he would shade his decisions instead of exercising the independence of judgment\nrequired by his public trust,” id. at 423, thereby “prevent[ing] the vigorous and fearless\nperformance of the prosecutor’s duty that is essential to the proper functioning of the\ncriminal justice system,” id. at 427-28. Although absolute immunity “leave[s] the\ngenuinely wronged defendant without civil redress against a prosecutor whose malicious\nor dishonest action deprives him of liberty,” “the broader public interest” would be\ndisserved if defendants could retaliate against prosecutors who were doing their duties.\nId. at 427.\n\n        Our cases since Imbler have employed a “functional approach” to determine\nwhether a prosecutor’s acts entitle her to absolute immunity. Burns, 500 U.S. at 486.\nUnder the functional approach, we “look[] to ‘the nature of the function performed, not\nthe identity of the actor who performed it’” when assessing whether conduct is\nprosecutorial, and thus absolutely protected. Buckley v. Fitzsimmons, 509 U.S. 259, 269\n(1993) (quoting Forrester v. White, 484 U.S. 219, 229 (1988)). Absolutely protected\nacts of advocacy include those “undertaken by a prosecutor in preparing for the initiation\nof judicial proceedings or for trial, and which occur in the course of his role as an\nadvocate for the State.” Id. at 273. A prosecutor is thus absolutely protected when she\nappears in court in support of an application for a search warrant and presents evidence\nat a probable cause hearing, Burns, 500 U.S. at 491-92, and when she prepares and files\nunsworn documents in order to obtain an arrest warrant, Kalina v. Fletcher, 522 U.S.\n118, 129 (1997). Absolute immunity also protects a prosecutor when she evaluates\nevidence and presents that evidence at trial or before a grand jury, Buckley, 509 U.S. at\n273; Higgason v. Stephens, 288 F.3d 868, 878 (6th Cir. 2002), prepares witnesses for\ntrial, Imbler, 424 U.S. at 430 n.32; Buckley, 509 U.S. at 273, and even elicits false\ntestimony from witnesses, Burns, 500 U.S. at 489-90; Buckley, 509 U.S. at 270-71. By\nshielding prosecutors engaging in these activities, absolute immunity “serves the policy\nof protecting the judicial process.” Burns, 500 U.S. at 492.\n\fNo. 09-2045         Adams v. Hanson                                                  Page 7\n\n\n        Nonetheless, because “[a]bsolute immunity is designed to free the judicial\nprocess,” not merely the prosecutor, “from the harassment and intimidation associated\nwith litigation,” absolute immunity protects “only . . . actions that are connected with the\nprosecutor’s role in judicial proceedings, not . . . every litigation-inducing conduct.” Id.\nat 494. Only qualified immunity is available to prosecutors when they perform\n“investigative” or “administrative” functions unrelated to judicial proceedings. Id. at\n483 n.2 (internal quotation marks omitted); see Buckley, 509 U.S. at 273; Holloway v.\nBrush, 220 F.3d 767, 774-75 (6th Cir. 2000) (en banc). Investigative acts outside the\nscope of absolute immunity include giving legal advice to the police during a pretrial\ninvestigation, Burns, 500 U.S. at 494-96, conspiring to fabricate evidence during the\ntime before convening a grand jury, Buckley, 509 U.S. at 274-76, and making false\nstatements at a press conference, id. at 276-78. In addition, a prosecutor is entitled to\nonly qualified immunity when she acts as a complaining witness by making sworn\nstatements to the court in support of a criminal complaint. Kalina, 522 U.S. at 129-31.\n\n        In sum, “acts undertaken in direct preparation of judicial proceedings . . . warrant\nabsolute immunity, whereas other acts, such as the preliminary gathering of evidence\nthat may ripen into a prosecution, are too attenuated to the judicial process to afford\nabsolute protection.” Ireland, 113 F.3d at 1445; see Harris v. Bornhorst, 513 F.3d 503,\n509-11 (6th Cir. 2008) (affirming denial of absolute immunity to a prosecutor who\ninstructed police to arrest suspect); Prince v. Hicks, 198 F.3d 607, 612-15 (6th Cir. 1999)\n(affirming denial of absolute immunity to a prosecutor who undertook a preliminary\ninvestigation and advised police that probable cause existed to arrest a suspect). In\ncategorizing a prosecutor’s acts, “the critical inquiry” for immunity purposes is thus\n“how closely related . . . the prosecutor’s challenged activity [is] to his role as an\nadvocate intimately associated with the judicial phase of the criminal process.”\nHolloway, 220 F.3d at 775 (internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis omitted). “The\nanalytical key to prosecutorial immunity, therefore, is advocacy—whether the actions\nin question are those of an advocate.” Id. (emphasis in original).\n\fNo. 09-2045         Adams v. Hanson                                                   Page 8\n\n\n        2. Prosecutorial Function\n\n        Because “[a]lmost any action by a prosecutor, including his or her direct\nparticipation in purely investigative activity, could be said to be in some way related to\nthe ultimate decision whether to prosecute,” Burns, 500 U.S. at 495, we must identify\nprecisely the wrongful acts allegedly performed by Hanson, and classify those acts\naccording to their function. Adams claims that Hanson made false and misleading\nfactual representations to the state trial court, ex parte and off the record during a hearing\nrecess, regarding the availability of Adams as a witness, and that these statements led to\nher unlawful arrest and detention. The district court determined that Hanson was entitled\nto absolute immunity from suit because she was acting as an advocate for the state in\nconnection with a preliminary examination. Adams disagrees: she claims that Hanson\nacted as a complaining witness, or, in the alternative, fulfilled an administrative function.\n\n        The case thus presents an issue of first impression in this circuit: whether a\nprosecutor is entitled to absolute immunity for her false and misleading statements to a\ntrial court in the course of criminal proceedings about the availability of a witness. The\nMichigan ACLU as Amicus argues that, as a rule, absolute immunity should not apply\nto actions of a prosecutor with respect to a third-party witness. Under this view, actions\nof a prosecutor vis-à-vis a criminal defendant should be distinguished from actions vis-à-\nvis a third-party witness, and absolute immunity should not be extended to the latter\nbecause the historical and policy rationales for absolute immunity do not apply with\nequal force in the witness context.\n\n        Other circuits that have addressed the question have held that prosecutors are\nordinarily entitled to absolute immunity for conduct falling within a prosecutorial\nfunction when they seek detention of a material witness pursuant to judicial order. See\nBetts v. Richard, 726 F.2d 79, 81 (2d Cir. 1984); Daniels v. Kieser, 586 F.2d 64, 68-69\n(7th Cir. 1978), cert. denied, 441 U.S. 931 (1979); cf. Odd v. Malone, 538 F.3d 202, 212\n(3d Cir. 2008) (plaintiff “acknowledge[d] that [prosecutor] was acting in her\nprosecutorial capacity when she secured the material witness warrant”). The Third\nCircuit has cautioned, however, that “policy considerations underlying prosecutorial\n\fNo. 09-2045           Adams v. Hanson                                                        Page 9\n\n\nimmunity counsel against recognizing absolute immunity” in material-witness cases.\nOdd, 538 F.3d at 216; see also al-Kidd v. Ashcroft, 580 F.3d 949, 963 (9th Cir. 2009),\nrev’d on other grounds,131 S. Ct. 2074 (2011) (holding that absolute immunity does not\nattach to prosecutor’s solely investigative use of a material-witness warrant).2 We have\nstated in dicta that absolute immunity protects a prosecutor seeking the incarceration of\na material witness, White by Swafford v. Gerbitz, 860 F.2d 661, 665 n.4 (6th Cir. 1988),\ncert. denied, 489 U.S. 1028 (1989), but not a prosecutor who fails to act timely to secure\na material-witness’s release after being ordered to do so by the court, id. The scope of\na prosecutor’s immunity in this context, however, has never been squarely addressed by\nthis court.\n\n        We conclude that Hanson’s statements before the trial court at the preliminary\nexamination regarding Adams’s availability as a witness fell within her role as an\nadvocate for the State of Michigan and are therefore absolutely protected. The\nprosecutorial function includes initiating criminal proceedings, appearing before the\ncourt at a probable cause hearing or before a grand jury, seeking an arrest warrant, and\npreparing witnesses. Imbler, 424 U.S. at 431 & n.33; Burns, 500 U.S. at 489-92;\nBuckley, 509 U.S. at 270-71, 73; Kalina, 522 U.S. at 129. Hanson’s challenged conduct\ninvolved the analogous acts of appearing at a preliminary examination and making\nstatements about her discussions with a potential witness—activities “closely related . . .\nto h[er] role as an advocate” before the court in criminal proceedings. Holloway, 220\nF.3d at 775 (emphasis in original) (internal quotation marks omitted). Furthermore,\nbecause the issuance of either a material-witness warrant or an order of contempt “is\nunquestionably a judicial act,” a prosecutor’s statements to the court regarding the\navailability of a witness are “‘intimately associated with the judicial phase of the\ncriminal process’ . . . . [and are] connected with the initiation and conduct of a\nprosecution, particularly where,” as here, “the hearing occurs after arrest [of the\n\n\n\n\n        2\n          The Supreme Court recently declined to address whether the United States Attorney General’s\nconduct in relation to material witnesses was protected by absolute immunity. See infra n.4.\n\fNo. 09-2045           Adams v. Hanson                                                       Page 10\n\n\ndefendant]” in the criminal proceedings.3 Burns, 500 U.S. at 492 (internal citation\nomitted).\n\n        It is especially instructive that, under Michigan law, it is the prosecutor’s\nparticular, non-delegable duty to “make a diligent good-faith effort to find and produce”\nwitnesses in criminal prosecutions. People v. Dye, 427 N.W.2d 501, 510 (Mich. 1988).\nAlthough the parties dispute whether Hanson sought to hold Adams as a material witness\nor in contempt of court, there is no dispute that Hanson sought to secure Adams’s\ntestimony as a witness in a criminal prosecution, a province of the prosecutor. That\nHanson allegedly acted outside of formal judicial proceedings, in an off-the-record\ndiscussion with the trial judge, does not strip her automatically of immunity for this\nconduct. “[T]he duties of the prosecutor in his role as advocate for the State involve\nactions preliminary to the initiation of a prosecution and actions apart from the\ncourtroom.” Imbler, 424 U.S. at 431 n.33. Specifically, conduct related to the\npreparation and presentation of witness testimony may be protected whether it occurs\nin or out of court. See id. at 430 n.32 (holding that prosecutor was entitled to absolute\nimmunity for making statements to police regarding the questioning of a witness during\na courtroom recess); cf. Buckley, 509 U.S. at 277-78 (denying prosecutor absolute\nimmunity for making out-of-court statements at a press conference). In fulfilling her\nprosecutorial duties, Hanson’s conduct constituted an “effort to control the presentation\nof [a] witness’ testimony” which is “fairly within [her] function as an advocate.” Imbler,\n424 U.S. at 430 n.32.\n\n\n\n\n        3\n         Material-witness arrests in Michigan are governed by the Michigan material-witness statute,\nwhich outlines the process to be undertaken by a court ordering a material witness’s detention. The\nMichigan material-witness statute states:\n        When it appears to a court of record that a person is a material witness in a criminal case\n        pending in a court in the county and that there is a danger of the loss of testimony of the\n        witness unless the witness furnishes bail or is committed if he or she fails to furnish bail,\n        the court shall require the witness to be brought before the court. After giving the\n        witness an opportunity to be heard, if it appears that the witness is a material witness\n        and that there is a danger of the loss of his or her testimony unless the witness furnishes\n        bail or is committed, the court may require the witness to enter into a recognizance with\n        a surety in an amount to be determined by the court for the appearance of the witness\n        at an examination or trial. If the witness fails to recognize, he or she shall be committed\n        to jail by the court, until he or she does recognize or is discharged by order of the court.\nMICH. COMP. LAWS ANN. § 767.35.\n\fNo. 09-2045            Adams v. Hanson                                                          Page 11\n\n\n         Because Hanson’s actions fell within her prosecutorial role, she is entitled to\nabsolute immunity even if her statements were false or misleading. As this court has\nrecently emphasized, “prosecutors do not forfeit their absolute immunity when they\nknowingly make false statements while advocating before the court,” Pittman v.\nCuyahoga Cnty. Dep’t of Children & Family Servs., 640 F.3d 716, 725 (6th Cir. 2011),\n“‘so long as the statements were related to the proceeding[s]’” in which they were made,\nid. (quoting Burns, 500 U.S. at 490).                 Therefore, even if Hanson made false\nrepresentations to the trial judge regarding Adams’s availability, she is protected by\nabsolute immunity because she was “serving as an advocate in judicial proceedings,”\nKalina, 522 U.S. at 125, when she made statements “related to th[ose] proceedings,”\nBurns, 500 U.S. at 490.\n\n         Hanson’s allegedly improper motive in seeking and securing Adams’s detention\ndoes not alter our conclusion that Hanson’s acts served a prosecutorial function.\nSuggesting an investigative purpose, Adams claims that Hanson sought her detention in\norder to coerce her into testifying in accordance with the 2006 statement. “As the line\nof absolute-immunity cases make clear, however, a prosecutor’s allegedly improper\nmotive alone is not enough to defeat absolute immunity, so long as the general nature\nof his actions falls within the scope of his duties as an advocate for the state.” Cady v.\nArenac Cnty., 574 F.3d 334, 341 (6th Cir. 2009). “[T]he general nature of [Hanson’s]\nactions” in making unsworn representations to the court regarding Adams’s availability\nto testify “f[ell] within the scope of h[er] duties as an advocate for the state,” and are\ntherefore absolutely protected whatever Hanson’s motive was in making them. Id.4\n\n\n\n\n         4\n           Reviewing whether a material-witness arrest was reasonable, the Supreme Court recently held\nthat the Fourth Amendment is not violated by a material-witness arrest made pursuant to an otherwise valid\nwarrant simply because the arrest was made for an investigative purpose. Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, 563 U.S.\n----, 131 S. Ct. 2074, 2085 (2011). Without examining what renders a material-witness warrant\nconstitutionally valid, the Court assumed that the warrant for al-Kidd was lawful absent the allegedly\nimproper pretext. Id. at 2083. Because the warrant was supported by individualized suspicion that the\nwitness was material and soon to be unavailable, the government’s motive in obtaining the warrant was\ndeemed irrelevant to the Fourth Amendment analysis. Id. at 2082-83. Disposing of al-Kidd’s claims on\nqualified immunity grounds, the Court held that Ashcroft did not violate clearly established law when he\nauthorized the pretextual use of material-witness warrants, id. at 2083-85, and declined to “address the\nmore difficult question whether [Ashcroft] enjoys absolute immunity,” id. at 2085.\n\fNo. 09-2045         Adams v. Hanson                                                Page 12\n\n\n        Absolute immunity would be defeated if Hanson’s acts and omissions were\ninstead administrative—i.e., if representing that Adams refused to testify without also\nsecuring her appearance in court served an administrative rather than prosecutorial\nfunction. We held in Holloway v. Brush that a social worker’s “out-of-court actions,\nmisinforming [a party] and failing to inform the court of the [party’s] appearance,”\nwhich led to the severing of the party’s parental rights, were administrative acts rather\nthan the conduct of an advocate. 220 F.3d at 776 (emphasis omitted). Adams, in\ncontrast, admitted that she told Hanson and the sheriffs that she would not appear in the\ncourtroom and testify, and Hanson presented this information to the trial court. Unlike\nthe social worker in Holloway, Hanson did not “appropriate[] the entire judicial process\nto herself by hiding [Adams] and the court from each other,” but rather, the trial court\nitself proceeded without providing Adams an opportunity to be heard. Id. at 777.\n\n        Significantly, the Michigan statute assigns responsibility for material-witness\nprotections to the court. The statute provides that, “[w]hen it appears to a court” that the\nappropriate conditions are met, then “the court shall require the witness to be brought\nbefore [it].” MICH. COMP. LAWS ANN. § 767.35 (emphasis added). The responsibility\nis thereby placed with the court to provide a witness the opportunity to be heard and to\nassess itself the materiality of her testimony and the likelihood that she would fail to\nappear. Id. Because this judicial process was not followed in this case, Adams was not\nprovided the opportunity to be heard or to furnish bail before the trial court ordered her\ndetained. Although we remain seriously troubled by the abrogation of Adams’s\nprocedural rights, Adams’s “experience illustrates the importance of vigilant exercise\nof this checking role by the judicial officer to whom the warrant application is\npresented,” not that prosecutors must be held accountable for judicial error. Al-Kidd,\n131 S. Ct. at 2088 n.2 (Ginsburg, J., concurring).\n\n        Along the same lines, this case is readily distinguishable from Odd v. Malone,\nin which the Third Circuit characterized as administrative the defendant-prosecutors’\nactions vis-à-vis detained material witnesses and denied absolute immunity. 538 F.3d\nat 217. One prosecutor had failed to inform the judge that the case for which the witness\n\fNo. 09-2045             Adams v. Hanson                                                              Page 13\n\n\nwas detained had been continued, per the judge’s order and per local custom. Id. at 212-\n13. Another failed to seek the release of a third-party witness in state custody after the\ntermination of the proceedings in which he was to testify. Id. at 215. The Third Circuit\nheld that these actions were not acts of advocacy related to conducting a prosecution for\nthe state but rather were administrative tasks which the prosecutors failed to complete.\nId. at 217. Hanson’s actions, in contrast, occurred while seeking a witness’s detention,\nnot after the detention had commenced, and Adams has not alleged that Hanson defied\nthe court’s instructions. In this case, moreover, the court was complicit in the alleged\ndenial of Adams’s procedural rights. Unlike the incarcerations in Odd, which were\nprolonged past the intention of the court due to prosecutorial oversight, it was left to the\nstate trial court in this case “to determine whom to incarcerate and for what length of\ntime.”5 Id. at 214.\n\n         Our opinion does not foreclose the possibility that Adams’s constitutional rights\nwere violated6 or that a prosecutor’s actions in relation to a witness may be\n\n\n         5\n             In its most recent pronouncement on absolute prosecutorial immunity, the Supreme Court held\nthat a prosecutor is entitled to absolute immunity even when performing an “administrative activit[y]” if\nthe act is done in the performance of an advocacy function. Van de Kamp v. Goldstein, 555 U.S. 335, 129\nS. Ct. 855, 861 (2009). Certain kinds of administrative obligations are “directly connected with the\nprosecutor’s basic trial advocacy duties,” id. at 863, and “require legal knowledge and the exercise of\nrelated discretion,” id. at 862. Thus, a supervisory prosecutor is entitled to absolute immunity when she\nhas engaged in these types of “administrative” tasks because prosecutors are “immune in a suit directly\nattacking their actions related to an individual trial” which are “‘intimately associated with the judicial\nphase of the criminal process.’” Id.\n            In Schneyder v. Smith, --- F.3d ---, No. 10-2367, 2011 WL 3211504, at *13-16 (3d Cir. July 29,\n2011), the Third Circuit reconsidered its holding in Odd in light of Van de Kamp, and reaffirmed the denial\nof absolute immunity to the prosecutor. The Third Circuit emphasized that the prosecutor’s failure to\nadvise the state trial judge of the status of the detained witness was “neither discretionary nor advocative,\nbut . . . instead . . . purely administrative,” and thus not protected by absolute immunity. Id. at *16.\n            Like the administrative acts in Van de Kamp, Hanson’s conduct before the state trial court, to the\nextent it can be characterized as administrative, was “directly connected with [her] basic trial advocacy\nduties,” 129 S. Ct. at 863, and “require[d] legal knowledge and the exercise of related discretion,” id. at\n862. Hanson’s discretionary and advocative statements when appearing before the state trial court were\n“integral to [the] advocacy function” of procuring a witness’s testimony. Warney v. Monroe Cnty., 587\nF.3d 113, 124 (2d Cir. 2009).\n         6\n           It stands to reason that “the rights of a material witness, charged with no wrongdoing, to be\nbrought before a magistrate certainly are at least equivalent to those of a person charged with a crime.”\nStone v. Holzberger, No. 92-3675, 1994 WL 175420, at *3 (6th Cir. Jan. 6, 1994) (unpublished opinion).\nAlthough the Supreme Court has never comprehensively addressed the statutory and constitutional\nrequirements for a valid material-witness warrant, some federal courts have applied wholesale the Fourth\nAmendment’s warrant requirement to a material-witness arrest because “the essential element” in\nanalyzing a seizure of the person “is the physical restraint placed upon the person, not the purpose behind\nthe restraint.” Bacon v. United States, 449 F.2d 933, 942 (9th Cir. 1971).\n          If the warrant requirement is adapted to the material-witness context, an application for a material-\nwitness warrant under the federal material-witness statute “must establish probable cause to believe that\n\fNo. 09-2045             Adams v. Hanson                                                              Page 14\n\n\nadministrative or investigative in another context.7 If Hanson had detained Adams\nwithout a court order, she likely would have been engaging in an “investigative act[]\nantecedent . . . to the judicial process” rather than absolutely protected prosecutorial\nactivity. Ireland, 113 F.3d at 1445. If police had detained Adams unilaterally, or\nmisrepresented the facts when applying for a warrant, she may have been able to bring\na viable § 1983 claim against them. See al-Kidd, 131 S. Ct. at 2089 (Ginsburg, J.,\nconcurring). In fact, however, Adams was arrested pursuant to a signed order from the\ntrial judge, and while it was Hanson’s job to present information about witnesses to the\ncourt, it was the court’s duty to respond with appropriate protections. Therefore,\nwhether or not Adams’s detention violated her constitutional rights, Hanson’s acts are\nprotected by absolute immunity.\n\n         3. Complaining Witness\n\n         Adams asks us to view Hanson’s acts differently: she claims that Hanson was\nacting as a complaining witness, not a prosecutor. At common law, witnesses testifying\nin court received absolute immunity, Burns, 500 U.S. at 489-90, but complaining\nwitnesses—those swearing to the facts in the initial complaint—did not, Kalina, 522\n\n\n\n\n(1) the witness’s testimony is material, and (2) it may become impracticable to secure the presence of the\nwitness by subpoena.” United States v. Awadallah, 349 F.3d 42, 64 (2d Cir. 2003) (emphasis added); see\nWhite by Swafford v. Gerbitz (II), 892 F.2d 457, 460-61 (6th Cir. 1989) (reviewing whether probable cause\nexisted for warrantless material-witness detention); Stone, 1994 WL 175420, at *3-4 (concluding that\npolice officers did not provide witness with a probable-cause hearing within a reasonable time).\n         The probable-cause standard may be inapplicable, however, because “[t]he typical arrest warrant\nis based on probable cause that the arrestee has committed a crime,” which is not the standard for the\nissuance of material-witness warrants. Al-Kidd, 131 S. Ct. at 2086 (Kennedy, J., concurring) (emphasis\nadded). “If material witness warrants do not qualify as ‘Warrants’ under the Fourth Amendment” such that\nthey are not subject to a probable-cause requirement, they “might still be governed by the Fourth\nAmendment’s separate reasonableness requirement for seizures of the person.” Id.; see Schneyder, 2011\nWL 3211504, at *4-8 (concluding that Fourth Amendment reasonableness requirement, but not probable-\ncause standard, applies to material-witness detention, and finding Fourth Amendment violation). For a\nFourth Amendment analysis of the federal material-witness statute, see Donald Q. Cochran, Material\nWitness Detention in a Post-9/11 World: Mission Creep or Fresh Start?, 18 GEO. MASON L. REV. 1, 16-24\n(2010).\n         7\n            As the ACLU noted in its brief, Adams provided an affidavit to the district court from an\nattorney who met with Adams and who claimed to have left a message for Hanson the day after Adams\nwas detained, informing her that Adams was willing to testify. The parties failed to mention, much less\nbrief, this fact before the district court or on appeal, and there is therefore nothing in the record regarding\nwhether Hanson received the voicemail or passed it on to the proper authorities. As a result, we cannot\nspeculate as to whether Hanson acted properly on this information or engaged in administrative oversight\nby failing to notify the trial court of Adams’s willingness to testify.\n\fNo. 09-2045        Adams v. Hanson                                                Page 15\n\n\nU.S. at 130-31. But see id. at 133-35 (Scalia, J., concurring) (disputing that complaining\nwitness was a meaningful label at common law).\n\n       A complaining witness is not entitled to absolute immunity, Malley v. Briggs,\n475 U.S. 335, 340-45 (1986), nor is a prosecutor who performs the same role, Kalina,\n522 U.S. at 129-31. Hanson, however, was not acting as a complaining witness. In\nKalina, the Supreme Court assessed whether a prosecutor acted as a complaining witness\nwhen she undertook three separate acts: filing an information, a motion for an arrest\nwarrant, and a sworn affidavit, in which she swore that the underlying facts provided to\nthe court to support the arrest warrant were true. Id. at 121. An arrest warrant was\nissued on the basis of the prosecutor’s sworn statements. Id. The Supreme Court\ndetermined that all these acts were prosecutorial except for swearing to the underlying\nfacts in the affidavit, id. at 129-31, in which the prosecutor “personally vouched for the\ntruth of the facts set forth in the certification under penalty of perjury,” id. at 121. By\noffering sworn testimony, the prosecutor “performed an act that any competent witness\nmight have performed.” Id. at 129-30. “Testifying about facts is the function of the\nwitness, not of the lawyer,” and therefore, “[e]ven when the person who makes the\nconstitutionally required ‘Oath or affirmation’ is a lawyer, the only function that she\nperforms in giving sworn testimony is that of a witness.” Id. at 130-31.\n\n       Advocating before the trial court in order to procure witness testimony, as\nHanson did, is more analogous to the application for a warrant that the Court held to be\nprosecutorial than the acts of a complaining witness. First, as described supra, Hanson’s\nconduct fell within her prosecutorial role. Second, there is no allegation that Hanson\nprovided sworn testimony. Adams asserts that the distinction between a prosecutor’s\nunsworn representations and a witness’s sworn representations is a distinction without\na difference. But the Supreme Court in Kalina found determinative that a prosecutor\nwas testifying to facts “under penalty of perjury” or giving “sworn testimony.” Id. at\n129, 131 (emphasis added). The Court explained:\n\n       Indeed, except for her act in personally attesting to the truth of the\n       averments in the certification, it seems equally clear that the preparation\n       and filing of the [sworn affidavit] was part of the advocate’s function as\n\fNo. 09-2045            Adams v. Hanson                                                             Page 16\n\n\n         well. The critical question, however, is whether she was acting as a\n         complaining witness rather than a lawyer when she executed the\n         certification “[u]nder penalty of perjury.”\n\nId. at 129 (emphasis added). Following Kalina, the Eleventh Circuit in Rivera\nconcluded that a prosecutor who provided the court with mistaken information, causing\nthe wrong man to be arrested, did not act as a complaining witness because he did not\nprovide sworn testimony. Rivera v. Leal, 359 F.3d 1350, 1354-55 (11th Cir. 2004); see\nid. at 1355 (“The sworn/unsworn distinction is more than critical; it is determinative.”).\n\n         A prosecutor’s acts in preparing and presenting to the court information in\nsupport of an arrest, and a witness’s acts in swearing to the truth of the facts supporting\ncriminal charges, serve distinct and essential functions. See Kalina, 522 U.S. at 129;\nIreland, 113 F.3d at 1447 (holding that prosecuting attorneys who prepared and\npresented the contents of a criminal complaint were entitled to absolute immunity). In\nthis case, Hanson’s unsworn statements during a “pretrial court appearance[] by the\nprosecutor in support of taking criminal action against a suspect,” are acts of advocacy\nprotected by absolute immunity.8 Burns, 500 U.S. at 492; see also Sanders v. City &\nCnty. of San Francisco, 226 F. App’x 687, 690 (9th Cir. 2007) (unpublished opinion)\n(holding that a prosecutor’s statements before a grand jury did not render him a\ncomplaining witness, and so deprive him of absolute immunity, because “word choice\nin the course of advocacy cannot turn a prosecutor into a witness”).\n\n\n\n\n         8\n            Hanson argues that there is an additional way in which Adams’s complaining-witness argument\nfails: because Adams was not arrested on criminal charges, Hanson could not have been a complaining\nwitness. Hanson did not “initiate[] or procure[] a criminal prosecution” against Adams; rather, she sought\nto detain Adams in the course of the criminal prosecution of another defendant. Kalina, 522 U.S. at 132\n(Scalia, J., concurring). In Kalina, by contrast, the prosecutor provided a sworn affidavit in support of\ncriminal charges.\n          It is not clear, however, that this distinction precludes Hanson from qualifying as a complaining\nwitness. An individual who testifies in support of an arrest warrant is a complaining witness. See Malley,\n475 U.S. at 340-41(“[O]ne who procured the issuance of an arrest warrant by submitting a complaint could\nbe held liable if the complaint was made maliciously and without probable cause.”). We need not and do\nnot decide whether to apply a different label to an individual who testifies in support of a material-witness\nwarrant as opposed to an arrest warrant for criminal activity. See al-Kidd, 131 S. Ct. at 2086 (Kennedy,\nJ., concurring) (comparing constitutional requirements governing typical arrest warrants with material-\nwitness warrants). Hanson does not qualify as a complaining witness because she did not provide sworn\ntestimony and was acting within her prosecutorial role.\n\fNo. 09-2045           Adams v. Hanson                                                       Page 17\n\n\n        4. Policy Considerations\n\n        Finally, in addition to the prosecutorial nature of Hanson’s actions, the policy\njustifications underlying prosecutorial immunity support absolute immunity in this case.\nTo determine whether a function is protected by absolute immunity, the Supreme Court\nconsiders whether: “(1) there is a common law tradition of according immunity in\nsimilar situations; (2) denying immunity would subject the prosecutor to the chilling\ninfluence of vexatious lawsuits; and (3) there exist adequate checks on prosecutorial\nabuse other than individual suits against the prosecutor.” Odd, 538 F.3d at 216.\n\n        First, regarding the common law, we find support for prosecutorial immunity in\nthe Court’s conclusion that “prosecutors . . . were absolutely immune from damages\nliability at common law for making false or defamatory statements in judicial\nproceedings (at least so long as the statements were related to the proceeding).” Burns,\n500 U.S. at 489-90. “This immunity extended to ‘any hearing before a tribunal which\nperform[ed] a judicial function.’” Id. at 490. In advocating before the trial court at a\npreliminary examination, Hanson made statements related to judicial proceedings that\nfall within this protection.\n\n        Second, regarding vexatious litigation, “pretrial court appearances by the\nprosecutor in support of taking criminal action against a suspect,” which include the\nsummoning of witnesses to a preliminary examination, “present a substantial likelihood\nof vexatious litigation that might have an untoward effect on the independence of the\nprosecutor.” Id. at 492. To be sure, a flood of litigation is less likely to arise from\ndetained witnesses than defendants, if for no other reason than that witness detention is\nrelatively rare.9 But in cases like this one, involving witnesses to gang activity, a\nprosecutor seeking to secure a witness’s appearance may be subject to harassment by\n\n\n\n        9\n           In 2004, United States magistrate judges conducted 4882 material-witness hearings. Charles\nDoyle, Cong. Research Serv., RL 33077, Arrest and Detention of Material Witnesses 3 n.10 (2005),\navailable at http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/crs/r133077.pdf. Detentions in the context of\nimmigration proceedings make up the bulk of material-witness arrests. See Adam Liptak, For Post-9/11\nMaterial Witness, It is a Terror of a Different Kind, N.Y. Times, Aug. 19, 2004, available at\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/19/us/threats-responses-detainees-for-post-9-11-material-\nwitness-it-terror-different.html?src=pm.\n\fNo. 09-2045            Adams v. Hanson                                                          Page 18\n\n\neither witnesses or defendants seeking to deter witness testimony, which would interfere\nwith the integrity of the criminal proceedings. Absolute immunity for advocacy before\na trial court to procure witness testimony thus “serves the policy of protecting the\njudicial process.” Id. at 492.\n\n         Third, regarding checks on prosecutorial abuse, the judicial process is available\nas a check on prosecutorial actions, and these “safeguards . . . tend to reduce the need\nfor private damages actions as a means of controlling unconstitutional conduct.” Butz\nv. Economou, 438 U.S. 478, 512 (1978). As discussed, supra, although it did not prevent\nthe claimed violations in this case, the Michigan material-witness statute provides a\njudicial process for protecting a witness’s rights. In addition, material witnesses may\npetition for habeas relief or move to quash their arrest warrants.10 Other checks on\nprosecutorial misconduct are provided by professional disciplinary actions and the\ncriminal prosecution of prosecutors.11 Imbler, 424 U.S. at 429.\n\n         We recognize that witnesses are particularly vulnerable because they are “not\nentitled to the protections available to criminal defendants, including the appellate\nprocess,” Odd, 538 F.3d at 217, but application of the analytical framework outlined by\nthe Supreme Court dictates absolute immunity for Hanson. Threats to the independence\nof the prosecutor, other means to protect witnesses’ rights, and, most importantly, the\nprosecutorial function served by Hanson’s conduct counsel in favor of the grant of\nabsolute immunity. Absent direction from the Supreme Court, we decline to make a\ncategorical exception to traditional absolute immunity analysis for prosecutorial actions\nwith respect to third-party witnesses. Accordingly, we hold that Prosecutor Hanson is\n\n\n\n         10\n           See Carolyn B. Ramsey, In the Sweat Box: A Historical Perspective on the Detention of\nMaterial Witnesses, 6 OHIO ST. J.

Although there is no information in the record\nregarding the resolution of the complaint, the State of Michigan’s Attorney Grievance Commission\nreceived a request for investigation of Hanson arising out of Adams’s detention, and Hanson filed an\nanswer detailing her conduct in the case.\n\fNo. 09-2045        Adams v.

CONCLUSION\n\n       When making statements at a preliminary examination about the availability of\na witness, Hanson functioned as an advocate for the State of Michigan and performed\nactions intimately associated with the judicial process.

Mary Massaron Ross, Plunkett Cooney, Detroit, Michigan, for Appellee. James J. Walsh, Bodman LLP, Ann Arbor, Michigan, for Amicus Curiae.</p>\n<p>Before: DAUGHTREY, MOORE, and STRANCH, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>OPINION</h2>\n<p>KAREN NELSON MOORE, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>After her arrest and incarceration as a witness in a criminal proceeding, LaTasha Adams (\"Adams\") brought suit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against Karen Hanson (\"Hanson\"), an assistant prosecutor in Genesee County, Michigan, in her individual capacity. Hanson subpoenaed Adams to testify in state court during the preliminary examination of a criminal defendant. When Adams arrived at the state courthouse, she and Hanson spoke about her possible testimony, and after their discussions, Hanson informed the trial court that Adams was unwilling to testify. The court ordered Adams detained based on Hanson's representations without providing Adams an opportunity to be heard or to post bond.</p>\n<p>In her federal § 1983 suit, Adams claims that she was unlawfully detained for twelve days as a result of Hanson's false and misleading representations to the state trial court regarding Adams's availability as a witness. The district court granted Hanson's motion for summary judgment on the grounds that Hanson is entitled to absolute immunity for conduct falling within her role as a prosecutor. Adams appeals, arguing that Hanson acted as a complaining witness or, in the alternative, fulfilled an administrative function. The American Civil Liberties Union Fund of Michigan filed an amicus brief arguing that absolute immunity should not protect prosecutors from suits filed by third-party witnesses.</p>\n<p>When making statements at a preliminary examination about the availability of a witness, Hanson functioned as an advocate for the State of Michigan and performed acts intimately associated with the judicial process. Because she is absolutely immune from suit for her prosecutorial conduct, we AFFIRM the district court's grant of summary judgment to Hanson.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Hanson, an assistant prosecutor, subpoenaed Adams to testify in a preliminary examination in a gang-related racketeering case in state court. One of the defendants charged in the case was Marquan Cager (\"Cager\"), the father of one of Adams's children. In 2006, Adams had filed a domestic violence complaint against Cager and provided a statement to investigating officers describing Cager's involvement in gang-related murders and drug-trafficking activities. When Cager was charged with crimes described in Adams's statement, Hanson authorized a subpoena compelling Adams to appear in court at a preliminary <span class=\"star-pagination\">*400</span> examination in order to testify about her knowledge of the criminal enterprise.</p>\n<p>Law-enforcement officers served the subpoena on Adams at her home the morning she was set to appear at the preliminary examination. Adams, who was six-and-a-half-months pregnant, arrived at the courthouse that afternoon and met with law-enforcement personnel. She was then taken to meet Hanson, who provided her with a copy of a report that documented her statements about Cager's criminal activity.</p>\n<p>Hanson advised Adams to review the report. She also told Adams that she would return in about an hour and a half to bring Adams into the courtroom to testify in conformity with her prior statements. Adams responded that she did not want to testify and that she was under a doctor's care due to a high-risk pregnancy. When Hanson returned, Adams repeated her refusal to testify. Adams informed Hanson that she was not going to testify in conformity with the report because she had not made the statements attributed to her and the statements were not true.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>According to Adams, Hanson returned to the courtroom and advised the judge, off the record, that Adams would not testify in accordance with the report, and that she should be held in contempt. Based on the information provided by Hanson, the trial judge signed a mittimus directing that Adams be held in jail until further order of the court. After the judge signed the mittimus, two sheriff's deputies confronted Adams and asked her if she was going to testify. When she informed them that she was not going to testify, she was handcuffed and taken to the Genesee County jail.</p>\n<p>Adams was incarcerated for twelve days, during which she was allegedly held in isolation for twenty-three hours a day. Before she was detained, Adams was never brought before the court and questioned about her willingness to testify or her ability to return to court to testify at a later date. She alleges that she was never given an opportunity to obtain counsel or post bond, and that she was never advised of the basis of her detention, of any right to be represented by counsel, or of any right to a hearing.</p>\n<p>In the days following her arrest, Adams submitted a kite notifying the jail authorities that she was willing to testify. In the meantime, however, the preliminary examination had been continued. A week later, when proceedings resumed, Adams was brought into the courtroom to testify, at which point several attorneys for the defendants demanded an explanation for why she had been incarcerated. Hanson first explained that Adams was held for contempt of court, but after reviewing the mittimus ordering Adams's arrest, she stated that Adams had been held, not for contempt, but as a material witness, as indicated on the order. Adams was released from custody after she completed her substantive testimony.</p>\n<p>Adams claims that Hanson sought to secure her detention in order to coerce her into testifying, and that she was detained for contempt of court at Hanson's suggestion. In Hanson's account, the trial judge ordered Adams held as a material witness and directed Hanson and an officer from the sheriff's department to write out a mittimus to that effect. Adams also asserts that Hanson made several false and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*401</span> misleading statements in order to persuade the court to hold Adams. Hanson told the court that she had been trying for three weeks to serve Adams with a subpoena, when efforts to serve Adams had been underway for only two weeks. Furthermore, Hanson failed to disclose to the court that Adams had been served with a subpoena only that morning and had appeared at the courthouse voluntarily the same day, which would have demonstrated to the court Adams's willingness to comply with the court's orders.</p>\n<p>Adams subsequently brought suit against Hanson in federal district court pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for violations of her constitutional rights under the Fourth, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments. Hanson filed a motion for summary judgment on the basis of absolute prosecutorial immunity which the district court granted on May 28, 2009. On July 22, 2009, the district court denied Adams's motion for relief from the order of dismissal, construing it as a motion for reconsideration. Adams timely appealed from the district court's opinion and order denying relief from the order of dismissal, and from the order granting Hanson's motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. ANALYSIS</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Standard of Review</h2>\n<p>We review de novo a district court's grant of summary judgment, construing the evidence and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party. <i>Ireland v. Tunis,</i> 113 F.3d 1435, 1440 (6th Cir.1997). Summary judgment is appropriate if \"there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and ... the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" FED.R.CIV.P. 56(c)(2) (2009). Hanson moved for summary judgment, so we accept the facts as alleged by Adams and draw all reasonable inferences in her favor.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Absolute Immunity</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Functional Test</h2>\n<p>The district court granted summary judgment on the grounds that Hanson is entitled to absolute immunity. \"Whether a defendant is entitled to absolute or qualified immunity from liability under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 is a legal question that [we] review[] de novo.\" <i>Moldowan v. City of Warren,</i> 578 F.3d 351, 374 (6th Cir.2009) (emphasis omitted). A government officer is entitled to absolute immunity for performing functions \"intimately associated with the judicial phase of the criminal process.\" <i>Imbler v. Pachtman,</i> 424 U.S. 409, 430, 96 S.Ct. 984, 47 L.Ed.2d 128 (1976). Hanson, as \"the official seeking absolute immunity[,] bears the burden of showing that such immunity is justified for the function in question.\" <i>Burns v. Reed,</i> 500 U.S. 478, 486, 111 S.Ct. 1934, 114 L.Ed.2d 547 (1991).</p>\n<p>In <i>Imbler,</i> the Supreme Court extended absolute immunity to prosecutors sued for damages under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, holding that a prosecutor is entitled to absolute immunity when he acts \"within the scope of his duties in initiating and pursuing a criminal prosecution.\" 424 U.S. at 410, 96 S.Ct. 984. Absolute immunity for prosecutorial duties is justified by the same considerations that supported prosecutorial immunity under the common law. These include \"concern that harassment by unfounded litigation would cause a deflection of the prosecutor's energies from his public duties, and the possibility that he would shade his decisions instead of exercising the independence of judgment required by his public trust,\" <i>id.</i> at 423, 96 S.Ct. 984, thereby \"prevent[ing] the vigorous and fearless performance of the prosecutor's duty that is essential to the proper functioning of the criminal justice system,\" <i>id.</i> at 427-28, 96 S.Ct. 984. Although absolute immunity \"leave[s] the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*402</span> genuinely wronged defendant without civil redress against a prosecutor whose malicious or dishonest action deprives him of liberty,\" \"the broader public interest\" would be disserved if defendants could retaliate against prosecutors who were doing their duties. <i>Id.</i> at 427, 96 S.Ct. 984.</p>\n<p>Our cases since <i>Imbler</i> have employed a \"functional approach\" to determine whether a prosecutor's acts entitle her to absolute immunity. <i>Burns,</i> 500 U.S. at 486, 111 S.Ct. 1934. Under the functional approach, we \"look[] to `the nature of the function performed, not the identity of the actor who performed it'\" when assessing whether conduct is prosecutorial, and thus absolutely protected. <i>Buckley v. Fitzsimmons,</i> 509 U.S. 259, 269, 113 S.Ct. 2606, 125 L.Ed.2d 209 (1993) (quoting <i>Forrester v. White,</i> 484 U.S. 219, 229, 108 S.Ct. 538, 98 L.Ed.2d 555 (1988)). Absolutely protected acts of advocacy include those \"undertaken by a prosecutor in preparing for the initiation of judicial proceedings or for trial, and which occur in the course of his role as an advocate for the State.\" <i>Id.</i> at 273, 113 S.Ct. 2606. A prosecutor is thus absolutely protected when she appears in court in support of an application for a search warrant and presents evidence at a probable cause hearing, <i>Burns,</i> 500 U.S. at 491-92, 111 S.Ct. 1934, and when she prepares and files unsworn documents in order to obtain an arrest warrant, <i>Kalina v. Fletcher,</i> 522 U.S. 118, 129, 118 S.Ct. 502, 139 L.Ed.2d 471 (1997). Absolute immunity also protects a prosecutor when she evaluates evidence and presents that evidence at trial or before a grand jury, <i>Buckley,</i> 509 U.S. at 273, 113 S.Ct. 2606, <i>Higgason v. Stephens,</i> 288 F.3d 868, 878 (6th Cir.2002), prepares witnesses for trial, <i>Imbler,</i> 424 U.S. at 430 n. 32, 96 S.Ct. 984; <i>Buckley,</i> 509 U.S. at 273, 113 S.Ct. 2606, and even elicits false testimony from witnesses, <i>Burns,</i> 500 U.S. at 489-90, 111 S.Ct. 1934; <i>Buckley,</i> 509 U.S. at 270-71, 113 S.Ct. 2606. By shielding prosecutors engaging in these activities, absolute immunity \"serves the policy of protecting the judicial process.\" <i>Burns,</i> 500 U.S. at 492, 111 S.Ct. 1934.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, because \"[a]bsolute immunity is designed to free the <i>judicial process,\"</i> not merely the prosecutor, \"from the harassment and intimidation associated with litigation,\" absolute immunity protects \"only ... actions that are connected with the prosecutor's role in judicial proceedings, not ... every litigation-inducing conduct.\" <i>Id.</i> at 494, 111 S.Ct. 1934. Only qualified immunity is available to prosecutors when they perform \"investigative\" or \"administrative\" functions unrelated to judicial proceedings. <i>Id.</i> at 483 n. 2, 111 S.Ct. 1934 (internal quotation marks omitted); <i>see </i><i>Buckley,</i> 509 U.S. at 273, 113 S.Ct. 2606; <i>Holloway v. Brush,</i> 220 F.3d 767, 774-75 (6th Cir.2000) (en banc). Investigative acts outside the scope of absolute immunity include giving legal advice to the police during a pretrial investigation, <i>Burns,</i> 500 U.S. at 494-96, 111 S.Ct. 1934, conspiring to fabricate evidence during the time before convening a grand jury, <i>Buckley,</i> 509 U.S. at 274-76, 113 S.Ct. 2606, and making false statements at a press conference, <i>id.</i> at 276-78, 113 S.Ct. 2606. In addition, a prosecutor is entitled to only qualified immunity when she acts as a complaining witness by making sworn statements to the court in support of a criminal complaint. <i>Kalina,</i> 522 U.S. at 129-31, 118 S.Ct. 502.</p>\n<p>In sum, \"acts undertaken in direct preparation of judicial proceedings... warrant absolute immunity, whereas other acts, such as the preliminary gathering of evidence that may ripen into a prosecution, are too attenuated to the judicial process to afford absolute protection.\" <i>Ireland,</i> 113 F.3d at 1445; <i>see </i><i>Harris v. Bornhorst,</i> 513 F.3d 503, 509-11 (6th Cir. 2008) (affirming denial of absolute immunity to a prosecutor who instructed police to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*403</span> arrest suspect); <i>Prince v. Hicks,</i> 198 F.3d 607, 612-15 (6th Cir.1999) (affirming denial of absolute immunity to a prosecutor who undertook a preliminary investigation and advised police that probable cause existed to arrest a suspect). In categorizing a prosecutor's acts, \"the critical inquiry\" for immunity purposes is thus \"how closely related ... the prosecutor's challenged activity [is] to his role as an advocate intimately associated with the judicial phase of the criminal process.\" <i>Holloway,</i> 220 F.3d at 775 (internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis omitted). \"The analytical key to prosecutorial immunity, therefore, is <i>advocacy</i>  whether the actions in question are those of an advocate.\" <i>Id.</i> (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Prosecutorial Function</h2>\n<p>Because \"[a]lmost any action by a prosecutor, including his or her direct participation in purely investigative activity, could be said to be in some way related to the ultimate decision whether to prosecute,\" <i>Burns,</i> 500 U.S. at 495, 111 S.Ct. 1934, we must identify precisely the wrongful acts allegedly performed by Hanson, and classify those acts according to their function. Adams claims that Hanson made false and misleading factual representations to the state trial court, ex parte and off the record during a hearing recess, regarding the availability of Adams as a witness, and that these statements led to her unlawful arrest and detention. The district court determined that Hanson was entitled to absolute immunity from suit because she was acting as an advocate for the state in connection with a preliminary examination. Adams disagrees: she claims that Hanson acted as a complaining witness, or, in the alternative, fulfilled an administrative function.</p>\n<p>The case thus presents an issue of first impression in this circuit: whether a prosecutor is entitled to absolute immunity for her false and misleading statements to a trial court in the course of criminal proceedings about the availability of a witness. The Michigan ACLU as Amicus argues that, as a rule, absolute immunity should not apply to actions of a prosecutor with respect to a third-party witness. Under this view, actions of a prosecutor vis-à-vis a criminal defendant should be distinguished from actions vis-à-vis a third-party witness, and absolute immunity should not be extended to the latter because the historical and policy rationales for absolute immunity do not apply with equal force in the witness context.</p>\n<p>Other circuits that have addressed the question have held that prosecutors are ordinarily entitled to absolute immunity for conduct falling within a prosecutorial function when they seek detention of a material witness pursuant to judicial order. <i>See </i><i>Betts v. Richard,</i> 726 F.2d 79, 81 (2d Cir.1984); <i>Daniels v. Kieser,</i> 586 F.2d 64, 68-69 (7th Cir.1978), <i>cert. denied,</i> 441 U.S. 931, 99 S.Ct. 2050, 60 L.Ed.2d 659 (1979); <i>cf. </i><i>Odd v. Malone,</i> 538 F.3d 202, 212 (3d Cir.2008) (plaintiff \"acknowledge[d] that [prosecutor] was acting in her prosecutorial capacity when she secured the material witness warrant\"). The Third Circuit has cautioned, however, that \"policy considerations underlying prosecutorial immunity counsel against recognizing absolute immunity\" in material-witness cases. <i>Odd,</i> 538 F.3d at 216; <i>see also al</i><i>-Kidd v. Ashcroft,</i> 580 F.3d 949, 963 (9th Cir.2009), <i>rev'd on other grounds,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 131 S.Ct. 2074, 179 L.Ed.2d 1149 (2011) (holding that absolute immunity does not attach to prosecutor's solely investigative use of a material-witness warrant).<sup>[2]</sup> We have stated <span class=\"star-pagination\">*404</span> in dicta that absolute immunity protects a prosecutor seeking the incarceration of a material witness, <i>White by </i><i>Swafford v. Gerbitz,</i> 860 F.2d 661, 665 n. 4 (6th Cir. 1988), <i>cert. denied,</i> 489 U.S. 1028, 109 S.Ct. 1160, 103 L.Ed.2d 219 (1989), but not a prosecutor who fails to act timely to secure a material-witness's release after being ordered to do so by the court, <i>id.</i> The scope of a prosecutor's immunity in this context, however, has never been squarely addressed by this court.</p>\n<p>We conclude that Hanson's statements before the trial court at the preliminary examination regarding Adams's availability as a witness fell within her role as an advocate for the State of Michigan and are therefore absolutely protected. The prosecutorial function includes initiating criminal proceedings, appearing before the court at a probable cause hearing or before a grand jury, seeking an arrest warrant, and preparing witnesses. <i>Imbler,</i> 424 U.S. at 431 &amp; n. 33, 96 S.Ct. 984; <i>Burns,</i> 500 U.S. at 489-92, 111 S.Ct. 1934; <i>Buckley,</i> 509 U.S. at 270-71, 273, 113 S.Ct. 2606; <i>Kalina,</i> 522 U.S. at 129, 118 S.Ct. 502. Hanson's challenged conduct involved the analogous acts of appearing at a preliminary examination and making statements about her discussions with a potential witness  activities \"closely related ... to h[er] <i>role as an advocate\"</i> before the court in criminal proceedings. <i>Holloway,</i> 220 F.3d at 775 (emphasis in original) (internal quotation marks omitted). Furthermore, because the issuance of either a material-witness warrant or an order of contempt \"is unquestionably a judicial act,\" a prosecutor's statements to the court regarding the availability of a witness are \"`intimately associated with the judicial phase of the criminal process'.... [and are] connected with the initiation and conduct of a prosecution, particularly where,\" as here, \"the hearing occurs after arrest [of the defendant]\" in the criminal proceedings.<sup>[3]</sup><i>Burns,</i> 500 U.S. at 492, 111 S.Ct. 1934 (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p>It is especially instructive that, under Michigan law, it is the prosecutor's particular, non-delegable duty to \"make a diligent good-faith effort to find and produce\" witnesses in criminal prosecutions. <i>People v. Dye,</i> 431 Mich. 58, 427 N.W.2d 501, 510 (1988). Although the parties dispute whether Hanson sought to hold Adams as a material witness or in contempt of court, there is no dispute that Hanson sought to secure Adams's testimony as a witness in a criminal prosecution, a province of the prosecutor. That Hanson allegedly acted outside of formal judicial proceedings, in an off-the-record discussion with the trial judge, does not strip her automatically of immunity for this conduct. \"[T]he duties of the prosecutor in his role as advocate for the State involve actions preliminary to the initiation of a prosecution and actions apart from the courtroom.\" <i>Imbler,</i> 424 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*405</span> U.S. at 431 n. 33, 96 S.Ct. 984. Specifically, conduct related to the preparation and presentation of witness testimony may be protected whether it occurs in or out of court. <i>See id.</i> at 430 n. 32, 96 S.Ct. 984 (holding that prosecutor was entitled to absolute immunity for making statements to police regarding the questioning of a witness during a courtroom recess); <i>cf. </i><i>Buckley,</i> 509 U.S. at 277-78, 113 S.Ct. 2606 (denying prosecutor absolute immunity for making out-of-court statements at a press conference). In fulfilling her prosecutorial duties, Hanson's conduct constituted an \"effort to control the presentation of [a] witness' testimony\" which is \"fairly within [her] function as an advocate.\" <i>Imbler,</i> 424 U.S. at 430 n. 32, 96 S.Ct. 984.</p>\n<p>Because Hanson's actions fell within her prosecutorial role, she is entitled to absolute immunity even if her statements were false or misleading. As this court has recently emphasized, \"prosecutors do not forfeit their absolute immunity when they knowingly make false statements while advocating before the court,\" <i>Pittman v. Cuyahoga Cnty. Dep't of Children &amp; Family Servs.,</i> 640 F.3d 716, 725 (6th Cir.2011), \"`so long as the statements were related to the proceeding[s]'\" in which they were made, <i>id.</i> (quoting <i>Burns,</i> 500 U.S. at 490, 111 S.Ct. 1934). Therefore, even if Hanson made false representations to the trial judge regarding Adams's availability, she is protected by absolute immunity because she was \"serving as an advocate in judicial proceedings,\" <i>Kalina,</i> 522 U.S. at 125, 118 S.Ct. 502, when she made statements \"related to th[ose] proceedings,\" <i>Burns,</i> 500 U.S. at 490, 111 S.Ct. 1934.</p>\n<p>Hanson's allegedly improper motive in seeking and securing Adams's detention does not alter our conclusion that Hanson's acts served a prosecutorial function. Suggesting an investigative purpose, Adams claims that Hanson sought her detention in order to coerce her into testifying in accordance with the 2006 statement. \"As the line of absolute-immunity cases make clear, however, a prosecutor's allegedly improper motive alone is not enough to defeat absolute immunity, so long as the general nature of his actions falls within the scope of his duties as an advocate for the state.\" <i>Cady v. Arenac Cnty.,</i> 574 F.3d 334, 341 (6th Cir.2009). \"[T]he general nature of [Hanson's] actions\" in making unsworn representations to the court regarding Adams's availability to testify \"f[ell] within the scope of h[er] duties as an advocate for the state,\" and are therefore absolutely protected whatever Hanson's motive was in making them. <i>Id.</i><sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>Absolute immunity would be defeated if Hanson's acts and omissions were instead administrative  i.e., if representing that Adams refused to testify without also securing her appearance in court served an administrative rather than prosecutorial function. We held in <i>Holloway v. Brush</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*406</span> that a social worker's \"out-of-court actions, misinforming [a party] and failing to inform the court of the [party's] appearance,\" which led to the severing of the party's parental rights, were administrative acts rather than the conduct of an advocate. 220 F.3d at 776 (emphasis omitted). Adams, in contrast, admitted that she told Hanson and the sheriffs that she would not appear in the courtroom and testify, and Hanson presented this information to the trial court. Unlike the social worker in <i>Holloway,</i> Hanson did not \"appropriate[] the entire judicial process to herself by hiding [Adams] and the court from each other,\" but rather, the trial court itself proceeded without providing Adams an opportunity to be heard. <i>Id.</i> at 777.</p>\n<p>Significantly, the Michigan statute assigns responsibility for material-witness protections to the court. The statute provides that, \"[w]hen it appears to <i>a court\"</i> that the appropriate conditions are met, then <i>\"the court</i> shall require the witness to be brought before [it].\" MICH. COMP. LAWS ANN. § 767.35 (emphasis added). The responsibility is thereby placed with the court to provide a witness the opportunity to be heard and to assess itself the materiality of her testimony and the likelihood that she would fail to appear. <i>Id.</i> Because this judicial process was not followed in this case, Adams was not provided the opportunity to be heard or to furnish bail before the trial court ordered her detained. Although we remain seriously troubled by the abrogation of Adams's procedural rights, Adams's \"experience illustrates the importance of vigilant exercise of this checking role by the judicial officer to whom the warrant application is presented,\" not that prosecutors must be held accountable for judicial error. <i>al-</i><i>Kidd,</i> 131 S.Ct. at 2088 n. 2 (Ginsburg, J., concurring).</p>\n<p>Along the same lines, this case is readily distinguishable from <i>Odd v. Malone</i><i>,</i> in which the Third Circuit characterized as administrative the defendant-prosecutors' actions vis-à-vis detained material witnesses and denied absolute immunity. 538 F.3d at 217. One prosecutor had failed to inform the judge that the case for which the witness was detained had been continued, per the judge's order and per local custom. <i>Id.</i> at 212-13. Another failed to seek the release of a third-party witness in state custody after the termination of the proceedings in which he was to testify. <i>Id.</i> at 215. The Third Circuit held that these actions were not acts of advocacy related to conducting a prosecution for the state but rather were administrative tasks which the prosecutors failed to complete. <i>Id.</i> at 217. Hanson's actions, in contrast, occurred while seeking a witness's detention, not after the detention had commenced, and Adams has not alleged that Hanson defied the court's instructions. In this case, moreover, the court was complicit in the alleged denial of Adams's procedural rights. Unlike the incarcerations in <i>Odd,</i> which were prolonged past the intention of the court due to prosecutorial oversight, it was left to the state trial court in this case \"to determine whom to incarcerate and for what length of time.\"<sup>[5]</sup><i>Id.</i> at 214.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*407</span> Our opinion does not foreclose the possibility that Adams's constitutional rights were violated<sup>[6]</sup> or that a prosecutor's actions in relation to a witness may be administrative or investigative in another context.<sup>[7]</sup> If Hanson had detained Adams without a court order, she likely would have been engaging in an \"investigative <span class=\"star-pagination\">*408</span> act[] antecedent ... to the judicial process\" rather than absolutely protected prosecutorial activity. <i>Ireland,</i> 113 F.3d at 1445. If police had detained Adams unilaterally, or misrepresented the facts when applying for a warrant, she may have been able to bring a viable § 1983 claim against them. <i>See al-</i><i>Kidd,</i> 131 S.Ct. at 2089 (Ginsburg, J., concurring). In fact, however, Adams was arrested pursuant to a signed order from the trial judge, and while it was Hanson's job to present information about witnesses to the court, it was the court's duty to respond with appropriate protections. Therefore, whether or not Adams's detention violated her constitutional rights, Hanson's acts are protected by absolute immunity.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. Complaining Witness</h2>\n<p>Adams asks us to view Hanson's acts differently: she claims that Hanson was acting as a complaining witness, not a prosecutor. At common law, witnesses testifying in court received absolute immunity, <i>Burns,</i> 500 U.S. at 489-90, 111 S.Ct. 1934, but complaining witnesses  those swearing to the facts in the initial complaint  did not, <i>Kalina,</i> 522 U.S. at 130-31, 118 S.Ct. 502. <i>But see id.</i> at 133-35, 118 S.Ct. 502 (Scalia, J., concurring) (disputing that complaining witness was a meaningful label at common law).</p>\n<p>A complaining witness is not entitled to absolute immunity, <i>Malley v. Briggs,</i> 475 U.S. 335, 340-45, 106 S.Ct. 1092, 89 L.Ed.2d 271 (1986), nor is a prosecutor who performs the same role, <i>Kalina,</i> 522 U.S. at 129-31, 118 S.Ct. 502. Hanson, however, was not acting as a complaining witness. In <i>Kalina,</i> the Supreme Court assessed whether a prosecutor acted as a complaining witness when she undertook three separate acts: filing an information, a motion for an arrest warrant, and a sworn affidavit, in which she swore that the underlying facts provided to the court to support the arrest warrant were true. <i>Id.</i> at 121, 118 S.Ct. 502. An arrest warrant was issued on the basis of the prosecutor's sworn statements. <i>Id.</i> The Supreme Court determined that all these acts were prosecutorial except for swearing to the underlying facts in the affidavit, <i>id.</i> at 129-31, 118 S.Ct. 502, in which the prosecutor \"personally vouched for the truth of the facts set forth in the certification under penalty of perjury,\" <i>id.</i> at 121, 118 S.Ct. 502. By offering sworn testimony, the prosecutor \"performed an act that any competent witness might have performed.\" <i>Id.</i> at 129-30, 118 S.Ct. 502. \"Testifying about facts is the function of the witness, not of the lawyer,\" and therefore, \"[e]ven when the person who makes the constitutionally required `Oath or affirmation' is a lawyer, the only function that she performs in giving sworn testimony is that of a witness.\" <i>Id.</i> at 130-31, 118 S.Ct. 502.</p>\n<p>Advocating before the trial court in order to procure witness testimony, as Hanson did, is more analogous to the application for a warrant that the Court held to be prosecutorial than the acts of a complaining witness. First, as described <i>supra,</i> Hanson's conduct fell within her prosecutorial role. Second, there is no allegation that Hanson provided sworn testimony. Adams asserts that the distinction between a prosecutor's unsworn representations and a witness's sworn representations is a distinction without a difference. But the Supreme Court in <i>Kalina</i> found determinative that a prosecutor was testifying to facts <i>\"under penalty of perjury\"</i> or giving <i>\"sworn testimony.\" Id.</i> at 129, 131, 118 S.Ct. 502 (emphasis added). The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote>Indeed, except for her act in personally attesting to the truth of the averments in the certification, it seems equally clear that the preparation and filing of the [sworn affidavit] was part of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*409</span> advocate's function as well. The critical question, however, is whether she was acting as a complaining witness rather than a lawyer when she executed the certification <i>\"[u]nder penalty of perjury.\"</i>\n</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 129, 118 S.Ct. 502 (emphasis added). Following <i>Kalina,</i> the Eleventh Circuit in <i>Rivera</i> concluded that a prosecutor who provided the court with mistaken information, causing the wrong man to be arrested, did not act as a complaining witness because he did not provide sworn testimony. <i>Rivera v. Leal,</i> 359 F.3d 1350, 1354-55 (11th Cir.2004); <i>see id.</i> at 1355 (\"The sworn/unsworn distinction is more than critical; it is determinative.\").</p>\n<p>A prosecutor's acts in preparing and presenting to the court information in support of an arrest, and a witness's acts in swearing to the truth of the facts supporting criminal charges, serve distinct and essential functions. <i>See </i><i>Kalina,</i> 522 U.S. at 129, 118 S.Ct. 502; <i>Ireland,</i> 113 F.3d at 1447 (holding that prosecuting attorneys who prepared and presented the contents of a criminal complaint were entitled to absolute immunity). In this case, Hanson's unsworn statements during a \"pretrial court appearance[] by the prosecutor in support of taking criminal action against a suspect,\" are acts of advocacy protected by absolute immunity.<sup>[8]</sup><i>Burns,</i> 500 U.S. at 492, 111 S.Ct. 1934; <i>see also Sanders v. City &amp; Cnty. of San Francisco,</i> 226 Fed. Appx. 687, 690 (9th Cir.2007) (unpublished opinion) (holding that a prosecutor's statements before a grand jury did not render him a complaining witness, and so deprive him of absolute immunity, because \"word choice in the course of advocacy cannot turn a prosecutor into a witness\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>4. Policy Considerations</h2>\n<p>Finally, in addition to the prosecutorial nature of Hanson's actions, the policy justifications underlying prosecutorial immunity support absolute immunity in this case. To determine whether a function is protected by absolute immunity, the Supreme Court considers whether: \"(1) there is a common law tradition of according immunity in similar situations; (2) denying immunity would subject the prosecutor to the chilling influence of vexatious lawsuits; and (3) there exist adequate checks on prosecutorial abuse other than individual suits against the prosecutor.\" <i>Odd,</i> 538 F.3d at 216.</p>\n<p>First, regarding the common law, we find support for prosecutorial immunity in the Court's conclusion that \"prosecutors... were absolutely immune from damages liability at common law for making false or <span class=\"star-pagination\">*410</span> defamatory statements in judicial proceedings (at least so long as the statements were related to the proceeding).\" <i>Burns,</i> 500 U.S. at 489-90, 111 S.Ct. 1934. \"This immunity extended to `any hearing before a tribunal which perform[ed] a judicial function.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 490, 111 S.Ct. 1934. In advocating before the trial court at a preliminary examination, Hanson made statements related to judicial proceedings that fall within this protection.</p>\n<p>Second, regarding vexatious litigation, \"pretrial court appearances by the prosecutor in support of taking criminal action against a suspect,\" which include the summoning of witnesses to a preliminary examination, \"present a substantial likelihood of vexatious litigation that might have an untoward effect on the independence of the prosecutor.\" <i>Id.</i> at 492, 111 S.Ct. 1934. To be sure, a flood of litigation is less likely to arise from detained witnesses than defendants, if for no other reason than that witness detention is relatively rare.<sup>[9]</sup> But in cases like this one, involving witnesses to gang activity, a prosecutor seeking to secure a witness's appearance may be subject to harassment by either witnesses or defendants seeking to deter witness testimony, which would interfere with the integrity of the criminal proceedings. Absolute immunity for advocacy before a trial court to procure witness testimony thus \"serves the policy of protecting the judicial process.\" <i>Id.</i> at 492, 111 S.Ct. 1934.</p>\n<p>Third, regarding checks on prosecutorial abuse, the judicial process is available as a check on prosecutorial actions, and these \"safeguards ... tend to reduce the need for private damages actions as a means of controlling unconstitutional conduct.\" <i>Butz v. Economou,</i> 438 U.S. 478, 512, 98 S.Ct. 2894, 57 L.Ed.2d 895 (1978). As discussed, <i>supra,</i> although it did not prevent the claimed violations in this case, the Michigan material-witness statute provides a judicial process for protecting a witness's rights. In addition, material witnesses may petition for habeas relief or move to quash their arrest warrants.<sup>[10]</sup> Other checks on prosecutorial misconduct are provided by professional disciplinary actions and the criminal prosecution of prosecutors.<sup>[11]</sup><i>Imbler,</i> 424 U.S. at 429, 96 S.Ct. 984.</p>\n<p>We recognize that witnesses are particularly vulnerable because they are \"not entitled to the protections available to criminal defendants, including the appellate process,\" <i>Odd,</i> 538 F.3d at 217, but application of the analytical framework outlined <span class=\"star-pagination\">*411</span> by the Supreme Court dictates absolute immunity for Hanson. Threats to the independence of the prosecutor, other means to protect witnesses' rights, and, most importantly, the prosecutorial function served by Hanson's conduct counsel in favor of the grant of absolute immunity. Absent direction from the Supreme Court, we decline to make a categorical exception to traditional absolute immunity analysis for prosecutorial actions with respect to third-party witnesses. Accordingly, we hold that Prosecutor Hanson is entitled to absolute prosecutorial immunity for her acts of advocacy before the state trial court in seeking to procure witness testimony at a preliminary examination.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>When making statements at a preliminary examination about the availability of a witness, Hanson functioned as an advocate for the State of Michigan and performed actions intimately associated with the judicial process. Because she is absolutely immune from suit for her prosecutorial conduct, we AFFIRM the district court's grant of summary judgment to Hanson.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Adams described their ensuing exchange as \"heated.\" Denying that her behavior toward Adams was confrontational, Hanson asserts that she gave Adams the option of testifying that her previous statements were not true, but Adams flatly refused to appear in court and testify under any circumstances. For purposes of summary judgment, however, Hanson stipulates to Adams's version of the facts.</p>\n<p>[2]  The Supreme Court recently declined to address whether the United States Attorney General's conduct in relation to material witnesses was protected by absolute immunity. <i>See infra</i> n.4.</p>\n<p>[3]  Material-witness arrests in Michigan are governed by the Michigan material-witness statute, which outlines the process to be undertaken by a court ordering a material witness's detention. The Michigan material-witness statute states:\n</p>\n<p>When it appears to a court of record that a person is a material witness in a criminal case pending in a court in the county and that there is a danger of the loss of testimony of the witness unless the witness furnishes bail or is committed if he or she fails to furnish bail, the court shall require the witness to be brought before the court. After giving the witness an opportunity to be heard, if it appears that the witness is a material witness and that there is a danger of the loss of his or her testimony unless the witness furnishes bail or is committed, the court may require the witness to enter into a recognizance with a surety in an amount to be determined by the court for the appearance of the witness at an examination or trial. If the witness fails to recognize, he or she shall be committed to jail by the court, until he or she does recognize or is discharged by order of the court.</p>\n<p>MICH. COMP. LAWS ANN. § 767.35.</p>\n<p>[4]  Reviewing whether a material-witness arrest was reasonable, the Supreme Court recently held that the Fourth Amendment is not violated by a material-witness arrest made pursuant to an otherwise valid warrant simply because the arrest was made for an investigative purpose. <i>Ashcroft v. al-Kidd,</i> 563 U.S. ___, 131 S.Ct. 2074, 2085, 179 L.Ed.2d 1149 (2011). Without examining what renders a material-witness warrant constitutionally valid, the Court assumed that the warrant for al-Kidd was lawful absent the allegedly improper pretext. <i>Id.</i> at 2083. Because the warrant was supported by individualized suspicion that the witness was material and soon to be unavailable, the government's motive in obtaining the warrant was deemed irrelevant to the Fourth Amendment analysis. <i>Id.</i> at 2082-83. Disposing of al-Kidd's claims on qualified immunity grounds, the Court held that Ashcroft did not violate clearly established law when he authorized the pretextual use of material-witness warrants, <i>id.</i> at 2083-85, and declined to \"address the more difficult question whether [Ashcroft] enjoys absolute immunity,\" <i>id.</i> at 2085.</p>\n<p>[5]  In its most recent pronouncement on absolute prosecutorial immunity, the Supreme Court held that a prosecutor is entitled to absolute immunity even when performing an \"administrative activit[y]\" if the act is done in the performance of an advocacy function. <i>Van de Kamp v. Goldstein,</i> 555 U.S. 335, 129 S.Ct. 855, 861, 172 L.Ed.2d 706 (2009). Certain kinds of administrative obligations are \"directly connected with the prosecutor's basic trial advocacy duties,\" <i>id.</i> at 863, and \"require legal knowledge and the exercise of related discretion,\" <i>id.</i> at 862. Thus, a supervisory prosecutor is entitled to absolute immunity when she has engaged in these types of \"administrative\" tasks because prosecutors are \"immune in a suit directly attacking their actions related to an individual trial\" which are \"`intimately associated with the judicial phase of the criminal process.'\" <i>Id.</i>\n</p>\n<p>In <i>Schneyder v. Smith,</i> 653 F.3d 313, 332 (3d Cir.2011), the Third Circuit reconsidered its holding in <i>Odd</i> in light of <i>Van de Kamp,</i> and reaffirmed the denial of absolute immunity to the prosecutor. The Third Circuit emphasized that the prosecutor's failure to advise the state trial judge of the status of the detained witness was \"neither discretionary nor advocative, but ... instead ... purely administrative,\" and thus not protected by absolute immunity. <i>Id.</i> at 334.</p>\n<p>Like the administrative acts in <i>Van de Kamp,</i> Hanson's conduct before the state trial court, to the extent it can be characterized as administrative, was \"directly connected with [her] basic trial advocacy duties,\" 129 S.Ct. at 863, and \"require[d] legal knowledge and the exercise of related discretion,\" <i>id.</i> at 862. Hanson's discretionary and advocative statements when appearing before the state trial court were \"integral to [the] advocacy function\" of procuring a witness's testimony. <i>Warney v. Monroe Cnty.,</i> 587 F.3d 113, 124 (2d Cir.2009).</p>\n<p>[6]  It stands to reason that \"the rights of a material witness, charged with no wrongdoing, to be brought before a magistrate certainly are at least equivalent to those of a person charged with a crime.\" <i>Stone v. Holzberger,</i> No. 92-3675, 1994 WL 175420, at *3 (6th Cir. Jan. 6, 1994) (unpublished opinion). Although the Supreme Court has never comprehensively addressed the statutory and constitutional requirements for a valid material-witness warrant, some federal courts have applied wholesale the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement to a material-witness arrest because \"the essential element\" in analyzing a seizure of the person \"is the physical restraint placed upon the person, not the purpose behind the restraint.\" <i>Bacon v. United States,</i> 449 F.2d 933, 942 (9th Cir.1971).\n</p>\n<p>If the warrant requirement is adapted to the material-witness context, an application for a material-witness warrant under the federal material-witness statute \"must establish <i>probable cause</i> to believe that (1) the witness's testimony is material, and (2) it may become impracticable to secure the presence of the witness by subpoena.\" <i>United States v. Awadallah,</i> 349 F.3d 42, 64 (2d Cir.2003) (emphasis added); <i>see White by </i><i>Swafford v. Gerbitz (II),</i> 892 F.2d 457, 460-61 (6th Cir.1989) (reviewing whether probable cause existed for warrantless material-witness detention); <i>Stone,</i> 1994 WL 175420, at *3-4 (concluding that police officers did not provide witness with a probable-cause hearing within a reasonable time).</p>\n<p>The probable-cause standard may be inapplicable, however, because \"[t]he typical arrest warrant is based on probable cause that the arrestee has <i>committed a crime,\"</i> which is not the standard for the issuance of material-witness warrants. <i>al-</i><i>Kidd,</i> 131 S.Ct. at 2086 (Kennedy, J., concurring) (emphasis added). \"If material witness warrants do not qualify as `Warrants' under the Fourth Amendment\" such that they are not subject to a probable-cause requirement, they \"might still be governed by the Fourth Amendment's separate reasonableness requirement for seizures of the person.\" <i>Id.; see </i><i>Schneyder,</i> 653 F.3d at 325 (concluding that Fourth Amendment reasonableness requirement, but not probable-cause standard, applies to material-witness detention, and finding Fourth Amendment violation). For a Fourth Amendment analysis of the federal material-witness statute, see Donald Q. Cochran, <i>Material Witness Detention in a Post-9/11 World: Mission Creep or Fresh Start?,</i> 18 GEO. MASON L. REV. 1, 16-24 (2010).</p>\n<p>[7]  As the ACLU noted in its brief, Adams provided an affidavit to the district court from an attorney who met with Adams and who claimed to have left a message for Hanson the day after Adams was detained, informing her that Adams was willing to testify. The parties failed to mention, much less brief, this fact before the district court or on appeal, and there is therefore nothing in the record regarding whether Hanson received the voicemail or passed it on to the proper authorities. As a result, we cannot speculate as to whether Hanson acted properly on this information or engaged in administrative oversight by failing to notify the trial court of Adams's willingness to testify.</p>\n<p>[8]  Hanson argues that there is an additional way in which Adams's complaining-witness argument fails: because Adams was not arrested on criminal charges, Hanson could not have been a complaining witness. Hanson did not \"initiate[] or procure[] a criminal prosecution\" against Adams; rather, she sought to detain Adams in the course of the criminal prosecution of another defendant. <i>Kalina,</i> 522 U.S. at 132, 118 S.Ct. 502 (Scalia, J., concurring). In <i>Kalina,</i> by contrast, the prosecutor provided a sworn affidavit in support of criminal charges.\n</p>\n<p>It is not clear, however, that this distinction precludes Hanson from qualifying as a complaining witness. An individual who testifies in support of an arrest warrant is a complaining witness. <i>See </i><i>Malley,</i> 475 U.S. at 340-41, 106 S.Ct. 1092 (\"[O]ne who procured the issuance of an arrest warrant by submitting a complaint could be held liable if the complaint was made maliciously and without probable cause.\"). We need not and do not decide whether to apply a different label to an individual who testifies in support of a material-witness warrant as opposed to an arrest warrant for criminal activity. <i>See al-</i><i>Kidd,</i> 131 S.Ct. at 2086 (Kennedy, J., concurring) (comparing constitutional requirements governing typical arrest warrants with material-witness warrants). Hanson does not qualify as a complaining witness because she did not provide sworn testimony and was acting within her prosecutorial role.</p>\n<p>[9]  In 2004, United States magistrate judges conducted 4882 material-witness hearings. Charles Doyle, Cong. Research Serv., RL 33077, Arrest and Detention of Material Witnesses 3 n.10 (2005), available at http://www. au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/crs/r133077.pdf. Detentions in the context of immigration proceedings make up the bulk of material-witness arrests. <i>See</i> Adam Liptak, <i>For Post-9/11 Material Witness, It is a Terror of a Different Kind,</i> N.Y. Times, Aug. 19, 2004, available at http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/19/us/ threats-responses-detainees-for-post-9-11-material-witness-it-terror-different.html?src= pm.</p>\n<p>[10]  <i>See</i> Carolyn B.

Walsh, Bodman LLP, Ann Arbor, Michigan, for Amicus Curiae.</p>\n<p>Before: DAUGHTREY, MOORE, and STRANCH, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>OPINION</h2>\n<p>KAREN NELSON MOORE, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>After her arrest and incarceration as a witness in a criminal proceeding, LaTasha Adams (\"Adams\") brought suit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against Karen Hanson (\"Hanson\"), an assistant prosecutor in Genesee County, Michigan, in her individual capacity. Hanson subpoenaed Adams to testify in state court during the preliminary examination of a criminal defendant. When Adams arrived at the state courthouse, she and Hanson spoke about her possible testimony, and after their discussions, Hanson informed the trial court that Adams was unwilling to testify. The court ordered Adams detained based on Hanson's representations without providing Adams an opportunity to be heard or to post bond.</p>\n<p>In her federal § 1983 suit, Adams claims that she was unlawfully detained for twelve days as a result of Hanson's false and misleading representations to the state trial court regarding Adams's availability as a witness. The district court granted Hanson's motion for summary judgment on the grounds that Hanson is entitled to absolute immunity for conduct falling within her role as a prosecutor. Adams appeals, arguing that Hanson acted as a complaining witness or, in the alternative, fulfilled an administrative function. The American Civil Liberties Union Fund of Michigan filed an amicus brief arguing that absolute immunity should not protect prosecutors from suits filed by third-party witnesses.</p>\n<p>When making statements at a preliminary examination about the availability of a witness, Hanson functioned as an advocate for the State of Michigan and performed acts intimately associated with the judicial process. Because she is absolutely immune from suit for her prosecutorial conduct, we AFFIRM the district court's grant of summary judgment to Hanson.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Hanson, an assistant prosecutor, subpoenaed Adams to testify in a preliminary examination in a gang-related racketeering case in state court. One of the defendants charged in the case was Marquan Cager (\"Cager\"), the father of one of Adams's children. In 2006, Adams had filed a domestic violence complaint against Cager and provided a statement to investigating officers describing Cager's involvement in gang-related murders and drug-trafficking activities. When Cager was charged with crimes described in Adams's statement, Hanson authorized a subpoena compelling Adams to appear in court at a preliminary <span class=\"star-pagination\">*400</span> examination in order to testify about her knowledge of the criminal enterprise.</p>\n<p>Law-enforcement officers served the subpoena on Adams at her home the morning she was set to appear at the preliminary examination. Adams, who was six-and-a-half-months pregnant, arrived at the courthouse that afternoon and met with law-enforcement personnel. She was then taken to meet Hanson, who provided her with a copy of a report that documented her statements about Cager's criminal activity.</p>\n<p>Hanson advised Adams to review the report. She also told Adams that she would return in about an hour and a half to bring Adams into the courtroom to testify in conformity with her prior statements. Adams responded that she did not want to testify and that she was under a doctor's care due to a high-risk pregnancy. When Hanson returned, Adams repeated her refusal to testify. Adams informed Hanson that she was not going to testify in conformity with the report because she had not made the statements attributed to her and the statements were not true.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>According to Adams, Hanson returned to the courtroom and advised the judge, off the record, that Adams would not testify in accordance with the report, and that she should be held in contempt. Based on the information provided by Hanson, the trial judge signed a mittimus directing that Adams be held in jail until further order of the court. After the judge signed the mittimus, two sheriff's deputies confronted Adams and asked her if she was going to testify. When she informed them that she was not going to testify, she was handcuffed and taken to the Genesee County jail.</p>\n<p>Adams was incarcerated for twelve days, during which she was allegedly held in isolation for twenty-three hours a day. Before she was detained, Adams was never brought before the court and questioned about her willingness to testify or her ability to return to court to testify at a later date. She alleges that she was never given an opportunity to obtain counsel or post bond, and that she was never advised of the basis of her detention, of any right to be represented by counsel, or of any right to a hearing.</p>\n<p>In the days following her arrest, Adams submitted a kite notifying the jail authorities that she was willing to testify. In the meantime, however, the preliminary examination had been continued. A week later, when proceedings resumed, Adams was brought into the courtroom to testify, at which point several attorneys for the defendants demanded an explanation for why she had been incarcerated. Hanson first explained that Adams was held for contempt of court, but after reviewing the mittimus ordering Adams's arrest, she stated that Adams had been held, not for contempt, but as a material witness, as indicated on the order. Adams was released from custody after she completed her substantive testimony.</p>\n<p>Adams claims that Hanson sought to secure her detention in order to coerce her into testifying, and that she was detained for contempt of court at Hanson's suggestion. In Hanson's account, the trial judge ordered Adams held as a material witness and directed Hanson and an officer from the sheriff's department to write out a mittimus to that effect. Adams also asserts that Hanson made several false and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*401</span> misleading statements in order to persuade the court to hold Adams. Hanson told the court that she had been trying for three weeks to serve Adams with a subpoena, when efforts to serve Adams had been underway for only two weeks. Furthermore, Hanson failed to disclose to the court that Adams had been served with a subpoena only that morning and had appeared at the courthouse voluntarily the same day, which would have demonstrated to the court Adams's willingness to comply with the court's orders.</p>\n<p>Adams subsequently brought suit against Hanson in federal district court pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for violations of her constitutional rights under the Fourth, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments. Hanson filed a motion for summary judgment on the basis of absolute prosecutorial immunity which the district court granted on May 28, 2009. On July 22, 2009, the district court denied Adams's motion for relief from the order of dismissal, construing it as a motion for reconsideration. Adams timely appealed from the district court's opinion and order denying relief from the order of dismissal, and from the order granting Hanson's motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. ANALYSIS</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Standard of Review</h2>\n<p>We review de novo a district court's grant of summary judgment, construing the evidence and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party. <i>Ireland v. Tunis,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"740989\"><a href=\"/opinion/740989/billie-m-ireland-v-gary-l-tunis-richard-thompson-john-meiers-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1435</span></a></span>, 1440 (6th Cir.1997). Summary judgment is appropriate if \"there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and ... the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" FED.R.CIV.P. 56(c)(2) (2009). Hanson moved for summary judgment, so we accept the facts as alleged by Adams and draw all reasonable inferences in her favor.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Absolute Immunity</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Functional Test</h2>\n<p>The district court granted summary judgment on the grounds that Hanson is entitled to absolute immunity. \"Whether a defendant is entitled to absolute or qualified immunity from liability under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 is a legal question that [we] review[] de novo.\" <i>Moldowan v. City of Warren,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">578</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">351</span></span>, 374 (6th Cir.2009) (emphasis omitted). A government officer is entitled to absolute immunity for performing functions \"intimately associated with the judicial phase of the criminal process.\" <i>Imbler v.

Adams claims that Hanson made false and misleading factual representations to the state trial court, ex parte and off the record during a hearing recess, regarding the availability of Adams as a witness, and that these statements led to her unlawful arrest and detention. The district court determined that Hanson was entitled to absolute immunity from suit because she was acting as an advocate for the state in connection with a preliminary examination. Adams disagrees: she claims that Hanson acted as a complaining witness, or, in the alternative, fulfilled an administrative function.</p>\n<p>The case thus presents an issue of first impression in this circuit: whether a prosecutor is entitled to absolute immunity for her false and misleading statements to a trial court in the course of criminal proceedings about the availability of a witness. The Michigan ACLU as Amicus argues that, as a rule, absolute immunity should not apply to actions of a prosecutor with respect to a third-party witness. Under this view, actions of a prosecutor vis-à-vis a criminal defendant should be distinguished from actions vis-à-vis a third-party witness, and absolute immunity should not be extended to the latter because the historical and policy rationales for absolute immunity do not apply with equal force in the witness context.</p>\n<p>Other circuits that have addressed the question have held that prosecutors are ordinarily entitled to absolute immunity for conduct falling within a prosecutorial function when they seek detention of a material witness pursuant to judicial order. <i>See </i><i>Betts v.

Dep't of Children &amp; Family Servs.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"217073\"><a href=\"/opinion/217073/pittman-v-ccdcfs/\"><span class=\"volume\">640</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">716</span></a></span>, 725 (6th Cir.2011), \"`so long as the statements were related to the proceeding[s]'\" in which they were made, <i>id.</i> (quoting <i>Burns,</i> 500 U.S. at 490, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112606\"><a href=\"/opinion/112606/burns-v-reed/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1934</span></a></span>). Therefore, even if Hanson made false representations to the trial judge regarding Adams's availability, she is protected by absolute immunity because she was \"serving as an advocate in judicial proceedings,\" <i>Kalina,</i> 522 U.S. at 125, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118156\"><a href=\"/opinion/118156/kalina-v-fletcher/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1934</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>Hanson's allegedly improper motive in seeking and securing Adams's detention does not alter our conclusion that Hanson's acts served a prosecutorial function. Suggesting an investigative purpose, Adams claims that Hanson sought her detention in order to coerce her into testifying in accordance with the 2006 statement. \"As the line of absolute-immunity cases make clear, however, a prosecutor's allegedly improper motive alone is not enough to defeat absolute immunity, so long as the general nature of his actions falls within the scope of his duties as an advocate for the state.\" <i>Cady v. Arenac Cnty.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1359756\"><a href=\"/opinion/1359756/cady-v-arenac-county/\"><span class=\"volume\">574</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">334</span></a></span>, 341 (6th Cir.2009). \"[T]he general nature of [Hanson's] actions\" in making unsworn representations to the court regarding Adams's availability to testify \"f[ell] within the scope of h[er] duties as an advocate for the state,\" and are therefore absolutely protected whatever Hanson's motive was in making them. <i>Id.</i><sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>Absolute immunity would be defeated if Hanson's acts and omissions were instead administrative  i.e., if representing that Adams refused to testify without also securing her appearance in court served an administrative rather than prosecutorial function. We held in <i>Holloway v. Brush</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*406</span> that a social worker's \"out-of-court actions, misinforming [a party] and failing to inform the court of the [party's] appearance,\" which led to the severing of the party's parental rights, were administrative acts rather than the conduct of an advocate. 220 F.3d at 776 (emphasis omitted). Adams, in contrast, admitted that she told Hanson and the sheriffs that she would not appear in the courtroom and testify, and Hanson presented this information to the trial court. Unlike the social worker in <i>Holloway,</i> Hanson did not \"appropriate[] the entire judicial process to herself by hiding [Adams] and the court from each other,\" but rather, the trial court itself proceeded without providing Adams an opportunity to be heard. <i>Id.</i> at 777.</p>\n<p>Significantly, the Michigan statute assigns responsibility for material-witness protections to the court. The statute provides that, \"[w]hen it appears to <i>a court\"</i> that the appropriate conditions are met, then <i>\"the court</i> shall require the witness to be brought before [it].\" MICH. COMP. LAWS ANN. § 767.35 (emphasis added). The responsibility is thereby placed with the court to provide a witness the opportunity to be heard and to assess itself the materiality of her testimony and the likelihood that she would fail to appear. <i>Id.</i> Because this judicial process was not followed in this case, Adams was not provided the opportunity to be heard or to furnish bail before the trial court ordered her detained. Although we remain seriously troubled by the abrogation of Adams's procedural rights, Adams's \"experience illustrates the importance of vigilant exercise of this checking role by the judicial officer to whom the warrant application is presented,\" not that prosecutors must be held accountable for judicial error. <i>al-</i><i>Kidd,</i> 131 S.Ct. at 2088 n. 2 (Ginsburg, J., concurring).</p>\n<p>Along the same lines, this case is readily distinguishable from <i>Odd v. Malone</i><i>,</i> in which the Third Circuit characterized as administrative the defendant-prosecutors' actions vis-à-vis detained material witnesses and denied absolute immunity. 538 F.3d at 217. One prosecutor had failed to inform the judge that the case for which the witness was detained had been continued, per the judge's order and per local custom. <i>Id.</i> at 212-13. Another failed to seek the release of a third-party witness in state custody after the termination of the proceedings in which he was to testify. <i>Id.</i> at 215. The Third Circuit held that these actions were not acts of advocacy related to conducting a prosecution for the state but rather were administrative tasks which the prosecutors failed to complete. <i>Id.</i> at 217. Hanson's actions, in contrast, occurred while seeking a witness's detention, not after the detention had commenced, and Adams has not alleged that Hanson defied the court's instructions. In this case, moreover, the court was complicit in the alleged denial of Adams's procedural rights. Unlike the incarcerations in <i>Odd,</i> which were prolonged past the intention of the court due to prosecutorial oversight, it was left to the state trial court in this case \"to determine whom to incarcerate and for what length of time.\"<sup>[5]</sup><i>Id.</i> at 214.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*407</span> Our opinion does not foreclose the possibility that Adams's constitutional rights were violated<sup>[6]</sup> or that a prosecutor's actions in relation to a witness may be administrative or investigative in another context.<sup>[7]</sup> If Hanson had detained Adams without a court order, she likely would have been engaging in an \"investigative <span class=\"star-pagination\">*408</span> act[] antecedent ... to the judicial process\" rather than absolutely protected prosecutorial activity. <i>Ireland,</i> 113 F.3d at 1445. If police had detained Adams unilaterally, or misrepresented the facts when applying for a warrant, she may have been able to bring a viable § 1983 claim against them. <i>See al-</i><i>Kidd,</i> 131 S.Ct. at 2089 (Ginsburg, J., concurring). In fact, however, Adams was arrested pursuant to a signed order from the trial judge, and while it was Hanson's job to present information about witnesses to the court, it was the court's duty to respond with appropriate protections. Therefore, whether or not Adams's detention violated her constitutional rights, Hanson's acts are protected by absolute immunity.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. Complaining Witness</h2>\n<p>Adams asks us to view Hanson's acts differently: she claims that Hanson was acting as a complaining witness, not a prosecutor. At common law, witnesses testifying in court received absolute immunity, <i>Burns,</i> 500 U.S. at 489-90, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112606\"><a href=\"/opinion/112606/burns-v-reed/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">502</span></a></span>. Hanson, however, was not acting as a complaining witness. In <i>Kalina,</i> the Supreme Court assessed whether a prosecutor acted as a complaining witness when she undertook three separate acts: filing an information, a motion for an arrest warrant, and a sworn affidavit, in which she swore that the underlying facts provided to the court to support the arrest warrant were true. <i>Id.</i> at 121, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118156\"><a href=\"/opinion/118156/kalina-v-fletcher/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">502</span></a></span>. An arrest warrant was issued on the basis of the prosecutor's sworn statements. <i>Id.</i> The Supreme Court determined that all these acts were prosecutorial except for swearing to the underlying facts in the affidavit, <i>id.</i> at 129-31, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118156\"><a href=\"/opinion/118156/kalina-v-fletcher/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">502</span></a></span>, in which the prosecutor \"personally vouched for the truth of the facts set forth in the certification under penalty of perjury,\" <i>id.</i> at 121, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118156\"><a href=\"/opinion/118156/kalina-v-fletcher/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">502</span></a></span>. By offering sworn testimony, the prosecutor \"performed an act that any competent witness might have performed.\" <i>Id.</i> at 129-30, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118156\"><a href=\"/opinion/118156/kalina-v-fletcher/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">502</span></a></span>. \"Testifying about facts is the function of the witness, not of the lawyer,\" and therefore, \"[e]ven when the person who makes the constitutionally required `Oath or affirmation' is a lawyer, the only function that she performs in giving sworn testimony is that of a witness.\" <i>Id.</i> at 130-31, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118156\"><a href=\"/opinion/118156/kalina-v-fletcher/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">502</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>Advocating before the trial court in order to procure witness testimony, as Hanson did, is more analogous to the application for a warrant that the Court held to be prosecutorial than the acts of a complaining witness. First, as described <i>supra,</i> Hanson's conduct fell within her prosecutorial role. Second, there is no allegation that Hanson provided sworn testimony. Adams asserts that the distinction between a prosecutor's unsworn representations and a witness's sworn representations is a distinction without a difference. But the Supreme Court in <i>Kalina</i> found determinative that a prosecutor was testifying to facts <i>\"under penalty of perjury\"</i> or giving <i>\"sworn testimony.\" Id.</i> at 129, 131, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118156\"><a href=\"/opinion/118156/kalina-v-fletcher/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">502</span></a></span> (emphasis added). The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote>Indeed, except for her act in personally attesting to the truth of the averments in the certification, it seems equally clear that the preparation and filing of the [sworn affidavit] was part of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*409</span> advocate's function as well. The critical question, however, is whether she was acting as a complaining witness rather than a lawyer when she executed the certification <i>\"[u]nder penalty of perjury.\"</i>\n</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 129, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118156\"><a href=\"/opinion/118156/kalina-v-fletcher/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">502</span></a></span> (emphasis added). Following <i>Kalina,</i> the Eleventh Circuit in <i>Rivera</i> concluded that a prosecutor who provided the court with mistaken information, causing the wrong man to be arrested, did not act as a complaining witness because he did not provide sworn testimony. <i>Rivera v. Leal,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"76452\"><a href=\"/opinion/76452/francisco-j-rivera-v-stephen-a-leal/\"><span class=\"volume\">359</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1350</span></a></span>, 1354-55 (11th Cir.2004); <i>see id.</i> at 1355 (\"The sworn/unsworn distinction is more than critical; it is determinative.\").</p>\n<p>A prosecutor's acts in preparing and presenting to the court information in support of an arrest, and a witness's acts in swearing to the truth of the facts supporting criminal charges, serve distinct and essential functions. <i>See </i><i>Kalina,</i> 522 U.S. at 129, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118156\"><a href=\"/opinion/118156/kalina-v-fletcher/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">502</span></a></span>; <i>Ireland,</i> 113 F.3d at 1447 (holding that prosecuting attorneys who prepared and presented the contents of a criminal complaint were entitled to absolute immunity). In this case, Hanson's unsworn statements during a \"pretrial court appearance[] by the prosecutor in support of taking criminal action against a suspect,\" are acts of advocacy protected by absolute immunity.<sup>[8]</sup><i>Burns,</i> 500 U.S. at 492, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112606\"><a href=\"/opinion/112606/burns-v-reed/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Appx. 687, 690 (9th Cir.2007) (unpublished opinion) (holding that a prosecutor's statements before a grand jury did not render him a complaining witness, and so deprive him of absolute immunity, because \"word choice in the course of advocacy cannot turn a prosecutor into a witness\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>4. Policy Considerations</h2>\n<p>Finally, in addition to the prosecutorial nature of Hanson's actions, the policy justifications underlying prosecutorial immunity support absolute immunity in this case. To determine whether a function is protected by absolute immunity, the Supreme Court considers whether: \"(1) there is a common law tradition of according immunity in similar situations; (2) denying immunity would subject the prosecutor to the chilling influence of vexatious lawsuits; and (3) there exist adequate checks on prosecutorial abuse other than individual suits against the prosecutor.\" <i>Odd,</i> 538 F.3d at 216.</p>\n<p>First, regarding the common law, we find support for prosecutorial immunity in the Court's conclusion that \"prosecutors... were absolutely immune from damages liability at common law for making false or <span class=\"star-pagination\">*410</span> defamatory statements in judicial proceedings (at least so long as the statements were related to the proceeding).\" <i>Burns,</i> 500 U.S. at 489-90, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112606\"><a href=\"/opinion/112606/burns-v-reed/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1934</span></a></span>. \"This immunity extended to `any hearing before a tribunal which perform[ed] a judicial function.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 490, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112606\"><a href=\"/opinion/112606/burns-v-reed/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1934</span></a></span>. In advocating before the trial court at a preliminary examination, Hanson made statements related to judicial proceedings that fall within this protection.</p>\n<p>Second, regarding vexatious litigation, \"pretrial court appearances by the prosecutor in support of taking criminal action against a suspect,\" which include the summoning of witnesses to a preliminary examination, \"present a substantial likelihood of vexatious litigation that might have an untoward effect on the independence of the prosecutor.\" <i>Id.</i> at 492, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112606\"><a href=\"/opinion/112606/burns-v-reed/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1934</span></a></span>. To be sure, a flood of litigation is less likely to arise from detained witnesses than defendants, if for no other reason than that witness detention is relatively rare.<sup>[9]</sup> But in cases like this one, involving witnesses to gang activity, a prosecutor seeking to secure a witness's appearance may be subject to harassment by either witnesses or defendants seeking to deter witness testimony, which would interfere with the integrity of the criminal proceedings. Absolute immunity for advocacy before a trial court to procure witness testimony thus \"serves the policy of protecting the judicial process.\" <i>Id.</i> at 492, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112606\"><a href=\"/opinion/112606/burns-v-reed/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1934</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>Third, regarding checks on prosecutorial abuse, the judicial process is available as a check on prosecutorial actions, and these \"safeguards ... tend to reduce the need for private damages actions as a means of controlling unconstitutional conduct.\" <i>Butz v. Economou,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109932\"><a href=\"/opinion/109932/butz-v-economou/\"><span class=\"volume\">438</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">478</span></a></span>, 512, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109932\"><a href=\"/opinion/109932/butz-v-economou/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">895</span></a></span> (1978). As discussed, <i>supra,</i> although it did not prevent the claimed violations in this case, the Michigan material-witness statute provides a judicial process for protecting a witness's rights. In addition, material witnesses may petition for habeas relief or move to quash their arrest warrants.<sup>[10]</sup> Other checks on prosecutorial misconduct are provided by professional disciplinary actions and the criminal prosecution of prosecutors.<sup>[11]</sup><i>Imbler,</i> 424 U.S. at 429, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109387\"><a href=\"/opinion/109387/imbler-v-pachtman/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">984</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>We recognize that witnesses are particularly vulnerable because they are \"not entitled to the protections available to criminal defendants, including the appellate process,\" <i>Odd,</i> 538 F.3d at 217, but application of the analytical framework outlined <span class=\"star-pagination\">*411</span> by the Supreme Court dictates absolute immunity for Hanson. Threats to the independence of the prosecutor, other means to protect witnesses' rights, and, most importantly, the prosecutorial function served by Hanson's conduct counsel in favor of the grant of absolute immunity. Absent direction from the Supreme Court, we decline to make a categorical exception to traditional absolute immunity analysis for prosecutorial actions with respect to third-party witnesses. Accordingly, we hold that Prosecutor Hanson is entitled to absolute prosecutorial immunity for her acts of advocacy before the state trial court in seeking to procure witness testimony at a preliminary examination.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>When making statements at a preliminary examination about the availability of a witness, Hanson functioned as an advocate for the State of Michigan and performed actions intimately associated with the judicial process. Because she is absolutely immune from suit for her prosecutorial conduct, we AFFIRM the district court's grant of summary judgment to Hanson.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Adams described their ensuing exchange as \"heated.\" Denying that her behavior toward Adams was confrontational, Hanson asserts that she gave Adams the option of testifying that her previous statements were not true, but Adams flatly refused to appear in court and testify under any circumstances. For purposes of summary judgment, however, Hanson stipulates to Adams's version of the facts.</p>\n<p>[2]  The Supreme Court recently declined to address whether the United States Attorney General's conduct in relation to material witnesses was protected by absolute immunity. <i>See infra</i> n.4.</p>\n<p>[3]  Material-witness arrests in Michigan are governed by the Michigan material-witness statute, which outlines the process to be undertaken by a court ordering a material witness's detention. The Michigan material-witness statute states:\n</p>\n<p>When it appears to a court of record that a person is a material witness in a criminal case pending in a court in the county and that there is a danger of the loss of testimony of the witness unless the witness furnishes bail or is committed if he or she fails to furnish bail, the court shall require the witness to be brought before the court. After giving the witness an opportunity to be heard, if it appears that the witness is a material witness and that there is a danger of the loss of his or her testimony unless the witness furnishes bail or is committed, the court may require the witness to enter into a recognizance with a surety in an amount to be determined by the court for the appearance of the witness at an examination or trial. If the witness fails to recognize, he or she shall be committed to jail by the court, until he or she does recognize or is discharged by order of the court.</p>\n<p>MICH. COMP. LAWS ANN. § 767.35.</p>\n<p>[4]  Reviewing whether a material-witness arrest was reasonable, the Supreme Court recently held that the Fourth Amendment is not violated by a material-witness arrest made pursuant to an otherwise valid warrant simply because the arrest was made for an investigative purpose. <i>Ashcroft v. al-Kidd,</i> 563 U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"217703\"><a href=\"/opinion/217703/ashcroft-v-al-kidd/\"><span class=\"volume\">131</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2074</span></a></span>, 2085, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"217703\"><a href=\"/opinion/217703/ashcroft-v-al-kidd/\"><span class=\"volume\">179</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1149</span></a></span> (2011). Without examining what renders a material-witness warrant constitutionally valid, the Court assumed that the warrant for al-Kidd was lawful absent the allegedly improper pretext. <i>Id.</i> at 2083. Because the warrant was supported by individualized suspicion that the witness was material and soon to be unavailable, the government's motive in obtaining the warrant was deemed irrelevant to the Fourth Amendment analysis. <i>Id.</i> at 2082-83. Disposing of al-Kidd's claims on qualified immunity grounds, the Court held that Ashcroft did not violate clearly established law when he authorized the pretextual use of material-witness warrants, <i>id.</i> at 2083-85, and declined to \"address the more difficult question whether [Ashcroft] enjoys absolute immunity,\" <i>id.</i> at 2085.</p>\n<p>[5]  In its most recent pronouncement on absolute prosecutorial immunity, the Supreme Court held that a prosecutor is entitled to absolute immunity even when performing an \"administrative activit[y]\" if the act is done in the performance of an advocacy function. <i>Van de Kamp v. Goldstein,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145911\"><a href=\"/opinion/145911/van-de-kamp-v-goldstein/\"><span class=\"volume\">555</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">335</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145911\"><a href=\"/opinion/145911/van-de-kamp-v-goldstein/\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">706</span></a></span> (2009). Certain kinds of administrative obligations are \"directly connected with the prosecutor's basic trial advocacy duties,\" <i>id.</i> at 863, and \"require legal knowledge and the exercise of related discretion,\" <i>id.</i> at 862. Thus, a supervisory prosecutor is entitled to absolute immunity when she has engaged in these types of \"administrative\" tasks because prosecutors are \"immune in a suit directly attacking their actions related to an individual trial\" which are \"`intimately associated with the judicial phase of the criminal process.'\" <i>Id.</i>\n</p>\n<p>In <i>Schneyder v. Smith,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">653</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">313</span></span>, 332 (3d Cir.2011), the Third Circuit reconsidered its holding in <i>Odd</i> in light of <i>Van de Kamp,</i> and reaffirmed the denial of absolute immunity to the prosecutor. The Third Circuit emphasized that the prosecutor's failure to advise the state trial judge of the status of the detained witness was \"neither discretionary nor advocative, but ... instead ... purely administrative,\" and thus not protected by absolute immunity. <i>Id.</i> at 334.</p>\n<p>Like the administrative acts in <i>Van de Kamp,</i> Hanson's conduct before the state trial court, to the extent it can be characterized as administrative, was \"directly connected with [her] basic trial advocacy duties,\" 129 S.Ct. at 863, and \"require[d] legal knowledge and the exercise of related discretion,\" <i>id.</i> at 862. Hanson's discretionary and advocative statements when appearing before the state trial court were \"integral to [the] advocacy function\" of procuring a witness's testimony. <i>Warney v.

Although the Supreme Court has never comprehensively addressed the statutory and constitutional requirements for a valid material-witness warrant, some federal courts have applied wholesale the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement to a material-witness arrest because \"the essential element\" in analyzing a seizure of the person \"is the physical restraint placed upon the person, not the purpose behind the restraint.\" <i>Bacon v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"299535\"><a href=\"/opinion/299535/in-the-matter-of-the-petition-of-leslie-bacon-for-writ-of-habeas-corpus-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">449</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">933</span></a></span>, 942 (9th Cir.1971).\n</p>\n<p>If the warrant requirement is adapted to the material-witness context, an application for a material-witness warrant under the federal material-witness statute \"must establish <i>probable cause</i> to believe that (1) the witness's testimony is material, and (2) it may become impracticable to secure the presence of the witness by subpoena.\" <i>United States v. Awadallah,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"784129\"><a href=\"/opinion/784129/united-states-v-osama-awadallah/\"><span class=\"volume\">349</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">42</span></a></span>, 64 (2d Cir.2003) (emphasis added); <i>see White by </i><i>Swafford v. Gerbitz (II),</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"534229\"><a href=\"/opinion/534229/walter-clyde-white-bnf-jean-swafford-v-gary-w-gerbitz-district/\"><span class=\"volume\">892</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">457</span></a></span>, 460-61 (6th Cir.1989) (reviewing whether probable cause existed for warrantless material-witness detention); <i>Stone,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1994</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">175420</span></span>, at *3-4 (concluding that police officers did not provide witness with a probable-cause hearing within a reasonable time).</p>\n<p>The probable-cause standard may be inapplicable, however, because \"[t]he typical arrest warrant is based on probable cause that the arrestee has <i>committed a crime,\"</i> which is not the standard for the issuance of material-witness warrants. <i>al-</i><i>Kidd,</i> 131 S.Ct. at 2086 (Kennedy, J., concurring) (emphasis added). \"If material witness warrants do not qualify as `Warrants' under the Fourth Amendment\" such that they are not subject to a probable-cause requirement, they \"might still be governed by the Fourth Amendment's separate reasonableness requirement for seizures of the person.\" <i>Id.; see </i><i>Schneyder,</i> 653 F.3d at 325 (concluding that Fourth Amendment reasonableness requirement, but not probable-cause standard, applies to material-witness detention, and finding Fourth Amendment violation). For a Fourth Amendment analysis of the federal material-witness statute, see Donald Q. Cochran, <i>Material Witness Detention in a Post-9/11 World: Mission Creep or Fresh Start?,</i> 18 GEO. MASON L. REV. 1, 16-24 (2010).</p>\n<p>[7]  As the ACLU noted in its brief, Adams provided an affidavit to the district court from an attorney who met with Adams and who claimed to have left a message for Hanson the day after Adams was detained, informing her that Adams was willing to testify. The parties failed to mention, much less brief, this fact before the district court or on appeal, and there is therefore nothing in the record regarding whether Hanson received the voicemail or passed it on to the proper authorities. As a result, we cannot speculate as to whether Hanson acted properly on this information or engaged in administrative oversight by failing to notify the trial court of Adams's willingness to testify.</p>\n<p>[8]  Hanson argues that there is an additional way in which Adams's complaining-witness argument fails: because Adams was not arrested on criminal charges, Hanson could not have been a complaining witness. Hanson did not \"initiate[] or procure[] a criminal prosecution\" against Adams; rather, she sought to detain Adams in the course of the criminal prosecution of another defendant. <i>Kalina,</i> 522 U.S. at 132, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118156\"><a href=\"/opinion/118156/kalina-v-fletcher/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">502</span></a></span> (Scalia, J., concurring). In <i>Kalina,</i> by contrast, the prosecutor provided a sworn affidavit in support of criminal charges.\n</p>\n<p>It is not clear, however, that this distinction precludes Hanson from qualifying as a complaining witness. An individual who testifies in support of an arrest warrant is a complaining witness. <i>See </i><i>Malley,</i> 475 U.S. at 340-41, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111611\"><a href=\"/opinion/111611/malley-v-briggs/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1092</span></a></span> (\"[O]ne who procured the issuance of an arrest warrant by submitting a complaint could be held liable if the complaint was made maliciously and without probable cause.\"). We need not and do not decide whether to apply a different label to an individual who testifies in support of a material-witness warrant as opposed to an arrest warrant for criminal activity. <i>See al-</i><i>Kidd,</i> 131 S.Ct. at 2086 (Kennedy, J., concurring) (comparing constitutional requirements governing typical arrest warrants with material-witness warrants). Hanson does not qualify as a complaining witness because she did not provide sworn testimony and was acting within her prosecutorial role.</p>\n<p>[9]  In 2004, United States magistrate judges conducted 4882 material-witness hearings. Charles Doyle, Cong. Research Serv., RL 33077, Arrest and Detention of Material Witnesses 3 n.10 (2005), available at http://www. au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/crs/r133077.pdf. Detentions in the context of immigration proceedings make up the bulk of material-witness arrests. <i>See</i> Adam Liptak, <i>For Post-9/11 Material Witness, It is a Terror of a Different Kind,</i> N.Y. Times, Aug. 19, 2004, available at http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/19/us/ threats-responses-detainees-for-post-9-11-material-witness-it-terror-different.html?src= pm.</p>\n<p>[10]  <i>See</i> Carolyn B. Ramsey, <i>In the Sweat Box: A Historical Perspective on the Detention of Material Witnesses,</i> 6 OHIO ST. J. CRIM. L. 681 nn. 60 &amp; 123 (2009) (discussing habeas relief from material-witness detention and witness-detention lawsuits against police departments); Stacey M. Studnicki &amp; John P. Apol, <i>Witness Detention and Intimidation: The History and Future of Material Witness Law,</i> 76 ST. JOHN'S L. REV. 483, 499-502 (2002) (collecting cases reviewing the validity of material-witness warrants).</p>\n<p>[11]  Such a check was apparently available here. Although there is no information in the record regarding the resolution of the complaint, the State of Michigan's Attorney Grievance Commission received a request for investigation of Hanson arising out of Adams's detention, and Hanson filed an answer detailing her conduct in the case.</p>\n\n</div>",
