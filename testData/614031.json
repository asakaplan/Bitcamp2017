Plaintiffs Lala Smith, Alice\nWilson, and Dennis Morris developed tardive dyskinesia as a result of their use of\ngeneric metoclopramide, a drug prescribed for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux\ndisease.   They filed individual actions against various manufacturers of generic\nmetoclopramide, alleging that the defendants failed to include adequate information on\nproduct labels concerning the risks of taking the drug long-term and seeking damages\nunder Kentucky state law for failure to warn. They also named as parties Wyeth, Inc.,\nand Schwarz Pharma, Inc., the manufacturers of the name-brand form of\nmetoclopramide, sold as Reglan, alleging fraud and tortious misrepresentation. The\ndistrict court dismissed the plaintiffs’ claims against the generic defendants on federal\npreemption grounds, finding a conflict between their tort claims and the federal\nregulation of generic drugs. The district court also dismissed the plaintiffs’ action\n\fNos. 09-5460/5466/5509              Smith, et al. v. Wyeth, Inc., et al.                      Page 3\n\n\nagainst the name-brand defendants because the plaintiffs did not allege that they had\ningested Reglan, a threshold requirement for a products-liability action under Kentucky\nlaw. We find no error with regard to either ruling and affirm.\n\n                  FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n        All three plaintiffs were originally prescribed Reglan to treat gastroesophageal\nreflux. The active ingredient in Reglan is metoclopramide, which is also available in\ngeneric form. Reglan, the name-brand form of metoclopramide, was manufactured by\ndefendant Wyeth from 1989 to 2001 and by defendant Schwarz from 2001 to 2005\n(collectively, the name-brand defendants). Kentucky, where the plaintiffs reside, has a\ngeneric-substitution law requiring pharmacies to fill prescriptions with a lower-priced,\ntherapeutically-equivalent generic drug unless the doctor or the purchaser explicitly\ninstructs otherwise. See KY. REV. STAT. § 217.822(1) (2010). As a result, the plaintiffs’\npharmacies filled their prescriptions for Reglan with generic metoclopramide1\nmanufactured and distributed by defendants Pliva, Barr Pharmaceuticals, Actavis, Teva\nPharmaceuticals, UDL Laboratories, and Morton Grove Pharmaceuticals (collectively,\nthe generic defendants). As a result of their long-term consumption of metoclopramide,\nall three plaintiffs allegedly developed tardive dyskinesia, a severe neurological disorder\nthat resembles Parkinson’s disease.\n\n        Plaintiffs Wilson and Morris filed suit against the generic and name-brand\ndefendants in federal court in 2007. Plaintiff Smith initially sued the same defendants\nin Kentucky state court, and the defendants removed the case to the federal district court\nin which the other suits were pending. Against the generic defendants, the plaintiffs\nasserted state-law failure-to-warn claims; against the name-brand defendants, they\nasserted state-law fraud, fraudulent concealment, and negligent misrepresentation,\nalleging that Reglan’s label and corresponding entry in the Physician’s Desk Reference\n\n\n\n        1\n         Although Smith and Wilson claim to have consumed only generic metoclopramide, plaintiff\nMorris does assert that he consumed some Reglan manufactured by Wyeth (but not Schwarz), a fact that\nWyeth did not contest before the district court. Morris, however, has voluntarily dismissed his claims\nagainst Wyeth.\n\fNos. 09-5460/5466/5509          Smith, et al. v. Wyeth, Inc., et al.                Page 4\n\n\nfalsely and misleadingly represented the risks associated with long-term use of\nmetoclopramide.\n\n       The district court initially issued orders granting summary judgment to the name-\nbrand defendants, dismissing the plaintiffs’ claims, and holding that Kentucky law does\nnot permit a cause of action for misrepresentation about a product against anyone other\nthan the product’s manufacturer or distributor. Subsequently, the district court granted\nsummary judgment to the generic defendants on federal preemption grounds. After\ndenying motions for reconsideration, the district court issued orders dismissing all claims\nand entered final judgment in favor of the defendants. This appeal followed.\n\n                                     DISCUSSION\n\nFederal Preemption\n\n       On appeal, the plaintiffs contend that the district court erred in concluding that\ntheir state-law failure-to-warn claims against the generic defendants were preempted by\nfederal law. Their arguments must fail, however, given the recent decision of the\nSupreme Court in Pliva, Inc. v. Mensing, 131 S.Ct. 2567 (2011), issued on June 23,\n2011. Just as in the present case, the plaintiffs in Mensing alleged that their long-term\nuse of generic metoclopramide caused tardive dyskinesia, and they predicated the\nmanufacturers’ liability under state law on the failure to provide adequate warnings on\nthe product’s label. The Supreme Court held unequivocally, however, that federal law\npreempts state laws that impose on generic-drug manufacturers the duty to change a\ndrug’s label, thus barring the plaintiffs’ state-law tort claims. The plain language of the\nPliva decision compels the same result here.\n\nKentucky Products Liability Law\n\n       On appeal, the plaintiffs also argue that the district court erred in granting the\nname-brand defendants’ motion for summary judgment on their state-law claims. The\ndistrict court first concluded that plaintiffs’ tort claims were subject to Kentucky’s\nProducts Liability Act, KY. REV. STAT. §§ 411.300 - 411.350 (2010). The court then\nheld that the claims could not succeed because the plaintiffs alleged that generic\n\fNos. 09-5460/5466/5509         Smith, et al. v. Wyeth, Inc., et al.                 Page 5\n\n\nmetoclopramide, not the defendants’ name-brand product Reglan, caused their injuries.\nAs a result, the action against the name-brand defendants was dismissed.\n\n       We review the district court’s dismissal de novo, construing the complaint in the\nplaintiffs’ favor and taking all well-pleaded allegations in the complaint as true. See\nBeaudry v. TeleCheck Servs., Inc., 579 F.3d 702, 704 (6th Cir. 2009). The Kentucky\nProducts Liability Act, a codification of preexisting common-law principles, defines a\n“product liability action” as “any action brought for or on account of personal injury,\ndeath or property damage caused by or resulting from the manufacture, construction,\ndesign, formulation . . . warning, instructing, marketing, advertising, packaging or\nlabeling of any product.” KY. REV. STAT. § 411.300(1) (2010). As the Kentucky\nSupreme Court has held, “[t]he [Products Liability Act] applies to all damage claims\narising from the use of products, regardless of the legal theory advanced.” Mosanto Co.\nv. Reed, 950 S.W.2d 811, 814 (Ky. 1997). We conclude that the district court correctly\napplied the Act here.\n\n       A threshold requirement of any products-liability claim is that the plaintiff assert\nthat the defendant’s product caused the plaintiff’s injury. See Holbrook v. Rose,\n458 S.W.2d 155, 157 (Ky. 1970). The plaintiffs in this case concede that they had\nconsumed only generic versions of metoclopramide and not Reglan. As the district court\nobserved, adopting their theory of liability would require the court to attribute any\ndeficiency in a name-brand manufacturer’s labeling and marketing of its products to\nproducts manufactured by its generic competitors. Such a theory, however, fails to\nsatisfy the threshold requirement of a products-liability action – that the defendant’s\nproduct have injured the plaintiff. As the district court stated, “Just because a company\nis in the same business as a tortfeasor, the company is not automatically liable for the\nharm caused by the tortfeasor’s product.”\n\n       The plaintiffs’ argument – that the name-brand defendants’ liability stems from\nthe fact that the regulatory structure governing name-brand and generic drugs makes it\nforeseeable that patients and their physicians will rely on the name-brand labels to use\nand prescribe generic drugs – has been rejected by all but one of the courts that have\n\fNos. 09-5460/5466/5509         Smith, et al. v. Wyeth, Inc., et al.              Page 6\n\n\nconsidered it. The leading case is Foster v. American Home Products Corp., 29 F.3d 165\n(4th Cir. 1994), in which the court held that the manufacturer of a name-brand drug has\nno duty to patients who ingested only a generic version of the drug manufactured by the\nname-brand drug company’s competitors. See also Colacicco v. Apotex, Inc., 432 F.\nSupp. 2d 514, 540-41 (E.D. Pa. 2006) (collecting cases), rev’d on other grounds, 521\nF.3d 253 (3d Cir. 2008). But see Conte v. Wyeth, Inc., 85 Cal. Rptr. 3d 299, 313 (Cal.\nCt. App. 2008) (“[W]e have no difficulty concluding that [the name-brand defendant]\nshould reasonably perceive that there could be injurious reliance on its product\ninformation by a patient taking generic metoclopramide.”). As have the majority of\ncourts to address this question, we reject the argument that a name-brand drug\nmanufacturer owes a duty of care to individuals who have never taken the drug actually\nmanufactured by that company. Moreover, and most significantly, the plaintiffs have\nnot convinced us that the state courts of Kentucky would adopt their vicarious-liability\nargument under the Kentucky Products Liability Act.\n\n                                   CONCLUSION\n\n       For the reasons set out above, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.\n\f",

The Kentucky Products Liability Act, a codification of preexisting common-law principles, defines a \"product liability action\" as \"any action brought for or on account of personal injury, death or property damage caused by or resulting from the manufacture, construction, design, formulation . . . warning, instructing, marketing, advertising, packaging or labeling of any product.\" KY.REV.STAT. § 411.300(1) (2010). As the Kentucky Supreme Court has held, \"[t]he [Products Liability Act] applies to all damage claims arising from the use of products, regardless of the legal theory advanced.\" <i>Monsanto Co. v. Reed,</i> 950 S.W.2d 811, 814 (Ky.1997). We conclude that the district court correctly applied the Act here.</p>\n<p>A threshold requirement of any products-liability claim is that the plaintiff assert that the defendant's product caused the plaintiff's injury. <i>See </i><i>Holbrook v. Rose,</i> 458 S.W.2d 155, 157 (Ky.1970). The plaintiffs in this case concede that they had consumed only generic versions of metoclopramide and not Reglan. As the district court observed, adopting their theory of liability would require the court to attribute any deficiency in a name-brand manufacturer's labeling and marketing of its products to products manufactured by its generic competitors. Such a theory, however, fails to satisfy the threshold requirement of a products-liability action that the <i>defendant's</i> product have injured the plaintiff. As the district court stated, \"Just because a company is in the same business as a tortfeasor, the company is not automatically liable for the harm caused by the tortfeasor's product.\"</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs' argumentthat the name-brand defendants' liability stems from the fact that the regulatory structure governing name-brand and generic drugs makes it foreseeable that patients and their physicians will rely on the name-brand <span class=\"star-pagination\">*424</span> labels to use and prescribe generic drugshas been rejected by all but one of the courts that have considered it. The leading case is <i>Foster v. American Home Products Corp.,</i> 29 F.3d 165 (4th Cir.1994), in which the court held that the manufacturer of a name-brand drug has no duty to patients who ingested only a generic version of the drug manufactured by the name-brand drug company's competitors. <i>See also </i><i>Colacicco v.

They filed individual actions against various manufacturers of generic metoclopramide, alleging that the defendants <span class=\"star-pagination\">*422</span> failed to include adequate information on product labels concerning the risks of taking the drug long-term and seeking damages under Kentucky state law for failure to warn. They also named as parties Wyeth, Inc., and Schwarz Pharma, Inc., the manufacturers of the name-brand form of metoclopramide, sold as Reglan, alleging fraud and tortious misrepresentation. The district court dismissed the plaintiffs' claims against the generic defendants on federal preemption grounds, finding a conflict between their tort claims and the federal regulation of generic drugs. The district court also dismissed the plaintiffs' action against the name-brand defendants because the plaintiffs did not allege that they had ingested Reglan, a threshold requirement for a products-liability action under Kentucky law. We find no error with regard to either ruling and affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>All three plaintiffs were originally prescribed Reglan to treat gastroesophageal reflux. The active ingredient in Reglan is metoclopramide, which is also available in generic form. Reglan, the name-brand form of metoclopramide, was manufactured by defendant Wyeth from 1989 to 2001 and by defendant Schwarz from 2001 to 2005 (collectively, the name-brand defendants). Kentucky, where the plaintiffs reside, has a generic-substitution law requiring pharmacies to fill prescriptions with a lower-priced, therapeutically-equivalent generic drug unless the doctor or the purchaser explicitly instructs otherwise. <i>See</i> KY.REV.STAT. § 217.822(1) (2010). As a result, the plaintiffs' pharmacies filled their prescriptions for Reglan with generic metoclopramide<sup>[1]</sup> manufactured and distributed by defendants Pliva, Barr Pharmaceuticals, Actavis, Teva Pharmaceuticals, UDL Laboratories, and Morton Grove Pharmaceuticals (collectively, the generic defendants). As a result of their long-term consumption of metoclopramide, all three plaintiffs allegedly developed tardive dyskinesia, a severe neurological disorder that resembles Parkinson's disease.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs Wilson and Morris filed suit against the generic and name-brand defendants in federal court in 2007. Plaintiff Smith initially sued the same defendants in Kentucky state court, and the defendants removed the case to the federal district court in which the other suits were pending. Against the generic defendants, the plaintiffs asserted state-law failure-to-warn claims; against the name-brand defendants, they asserted state-law fraud, fraudulent concealment, and negligent misrepresentation, alleging that Reglan's label and corresponding entry in the Physician's Desk Reference falsely and misleadingly represented the risks associated with long-term use of metoclopramide.</p>\n<p>The district court initially issued orders granting summary judgment to the name-brand defendants, dismissing the plaintiffs' claims, and holding that Kentucky law does not permit a cause of action for misrepresentation about a product against anyone other than the product's manufacturer or distributor. Subsequently, the district court granted summary judgment to the generic defendants on federal preemption grounds. After denying motions for reconsideration, the district court issued orders dismissing all claims and entered final judgment in favor of the defendants. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*423</span> DISCUSSION</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Federal Preemption</h2>\n<p>On appeal, the plaintiffs contend that the district court erred in concluding that their state-law failure-to-warn claims against the generic defendants were preempted by federal law. Their arguments must fail, however, given the recent decision of the Supreme Court in <i>PLIVA, Inc. v. Mensing,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"219510\"><a href=\"/opinion/219510/pliva-inc-v-mensing/\"><span class=\"volume\">131</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2567</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"219510\"><a href=\"/opinion/219510/pliva-inc-v-mensing/\"><span class=\"volume\">180</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">580</span></a></span> (2011), issued on June 23, 2011. Just as in the present case, the plaintiffs in <i>Mensing</i> alleged that their long-term use of generic metoclopramide caused tardive dyskinesia, and they predicated the manufacturers' liability under state law on the failure to provide adequate warnings on the product's label. The Supreme Court held unequivocally, however, that federal law preempts state laws that impose on generic-drug manufacturers the duty to change a drug's label, thus barring the plaintiffs' state-law tort claims. The plain language of the <i>PLIVA</i> decision compels the same result here.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Kentucky Products Liability Law</h2>\n<p>On appeal, the plaintiffs also argue that the district court erred in granting the name-brand defendants' motion for summary judgment on their state-law claims. The district court first concluded that plaintiffs' tort claims were subject to Kentucky's Products Liability Act, KY.REV. STAT. §§ 411.300-411.350 (2010). The court then held that the claims could not succeed because the plaintiffs alleged that generic metoclopramide, not the defendants' name-brand product Reglan, caused their injuries. As a result, the action against the name-brand defendants was dismissed.</p>\n<p>We review the district court's dismissal <i>de novo,</i> construing the complaint in the plaintiffs' favor and taking all well-pleaded allegations in the complaint as true. <i>See </i><i>Beaudry v.
