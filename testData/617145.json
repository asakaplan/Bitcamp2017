Billy Joe Sowell was convicted of aggravated murder\nand sentenced to death by a three-judge panel in 1983. At sentencing, counsel’s\nmitigation strategy was to portray Sowell as a good person who lost his temper under the\ninfluence of drugs and alcohol. Counsel pursued this strategy despite having available\nthe reports of several court-appointed mental health experts, which hinted at Sowell’s\ndifficult upbringing but did not provide specific details about his severely impoverished\nand abusive childhood. Despite these reports, counsel did not conduct an investigation\ninto Sowell’s background or interview any of his family members. Had they done so,\nthere is a reasonable probability that the additional mitigating evidence would have led\nat least one of the panel judges to vote against the death penalty. The district court\ntherefore properly granted habeas relief on this basis.\n\n                                             I.\n\n         The facts underlying Sowell’s conviction are not in dispute. As we did in our\ninitial review of Sowell’s petition, we rely on the Ohio Court of Appeals’ version of the\nfacts:\n\n                 The record discloses that [Sowell] and [Calvert] Graham resided\n         in adjacent apartments on the third floor of an apartment building in\n         downtown Cincinnati. [Sowell] was the resident manager of the building\n         and became acquainted with Graham, who performed occasional odd\n         jobs at the apartment building. After Graham became a resident in\n         [Sowell’s] apartment building, the two men developed a friendly\n         relationship and visited one another in their respective residences.\n                 On May 1, 1983, three days prior to the instant offenses, [Sowell]\n         was a guest in Graham’s apartment. Also present were Donna Edwards\n         (Edwards), a woman with whom Graham shared the apartment, and\n         [Pam] Billups [a former prostitute who had been visiting Graham and\n         Edwards]. Graham offered two marijuana cigarettes to [Sowell], which\n         he accepted. Thereafter [Sowell] left the apartment in the company of\n         Billups and proceeded to a nearby restaurant where he purchased dinner\n\fNos. 08-3522/3575           Sowell v. Anderson                                       Page 3\n\n\n      for her. En route to the restaurant, [Sowell] smoked the second\n      marijuana cigarette, having consumed the first at Graham’s residence.\n      Thereafter the pair made their way to a hotel where [Sowell] rented a\n      room. There was conflicting testimony concerning the events that\n      transpired thereafter. However, it is not disputed that [Sowell] eventually\n      lost consciousness, having consumed an unspecified quantity of wine\n      during the evening in addition to the marijuana. The next morning\n      [Sowell] made his way back to his residence, stopping along his route to\n      obtain breakfast for Billups.\n              [Sowell] next encountered Billups on the afternoon of May 4,\n      1983. Billups was in the company of Edwards and the trio passed in the\n      doorway of a store but did not acknowledge one another. As will be\n      seen, this seemingly inconsequential meeting gained significance later in\n      the day.\n              That evening [Sowell] returned to his apartment building after,\n      according to his testimony, visiting no less than five taverns and\n      consuming at least one double shot of vodka at each stop. Upon\n      returning to his apartment building [Sowell] realized that he was not in\n      the mood to retire for the evening, and instead presented himself at\n      Graham’s apartment. Graham greeted [Sowell] and invited him inside,\n      where Edwards and Billups were also present. Graham produced a\n      marijuana cigarette which was consumed by all four occupants.\n              [Sowell] testified before the trial court that following the\n      consumption of the marijuana, he fell asleep for a short time. When he\n      awoke the others were still present and [Sowell] discovered that\n      approximately $190 had been removed from his trouser pocket. At first\n      [Sowell] thought that the trio was playing a joke upon him; however, his\n      requests for the return of his money received no response. [Sowell]\n      further testified that Graham then picked up a knife and ordered [Sowell]\n      to leave the residence. [Sowell] complied and departed, but he was\n      extremely angry as a result of his loss.\n               Both Billups and Edwards told the trial court that [Sowell’s] visit\n      to the apartment on the day in question was at first friendly. However,\n      [Sowell] soon became agitated and accused Billups of being unsociable\n      in that she did not speak to him earlier that afternoon. [Sowell] also\n      accused Billups of stealing $24 from him during their encounter three\n      days earlier. When [Sowell] referred to Billups in terms meant to insult\n      her pedigree, Graham ordered [Sowell] to leave the premises. [Sowell]\n      left, stating that he was going to obtain his gun, return and shoot Billups.\n            [Sowell] went directly to his apartment where he directed his\n      common-law wife, Lenora Waugh (Waugh), to bring his gun to him.\n      Waugh complied with that request, as well as with [Sowell’s] instructions\n\fNos. 08-3522/3575            Sowell v. Anderson                                     Page 4\n\n\n       to accompany him to Graham’s apartment. Upon returning to Graham’s\n       door, Waugh, at [Sowell’s] instruction, knocked and indicated to those\n       inside that she was a woman named Portia. Graham responded to the\n       door and opened it. Edwards and Billups testified, and the trial court\n       found, that [Sowell] forced his way into the apartment, firing a bullet\n       from his handgun into the ceiling as he entered. [Sowell] demanded to\n       know Billups’s whereabouts and threatened to shoot her. Graham was\n       able to calm [Sowell] and began to escort him from the apartment and to\n       close the door, whereupon [Sowell] suddenly turned and shot Graham in\n       the abdomen. As Graham fell, [Sowell] fired a second shot into\n       Graham's skull. Graham fell to the floor, mortally wounded.\n                [Sowell] next made his way to the closet in which Billups was\n       cowering, and fired three bullets into her body. [Sowell] next placed the\n       gun to Billups’s forehead and pulled the trigger. However, the gun did\n       not expel a bullet because it no longer contained ammunition. [Sowell]\n       left the apartment after warning Edwards not to leave the premises or he\n       would shoot her also. [Sowell] returned to his apartment, obtained\n       money and made his way to a nearby tavern where he was apprehended\n       by the police.\n               [Sowell] testified regarding the shootings and told the court that\n       he returned to Graham’s apartment to demand his money and that he was\n       confronted by Graham, who was armed with a knife. [Sowell] stated that\n       it was only after Graham made a furtive movement that [Sowell] began\n       shooting at Graham, and that one of the bullets struck the ceiling.\n       [Sowell] explained his conduct as follows: “It just, I just clocked out.\n       When I seen that person going this way I just pivoted, I pivoted on my\n       gun, I was shooting, I was angry, I started shooting, I just started\n       shooting everybody I seen.”\n\nState v. Sowell, No. C-830835, 1986 WL 9082, at *1-2 (Ohio Ct. App. Aug. 20, 1986)\n(footnotes omitted).\n\n       Sowell was indicted on one count of aggravated murder for the shooting of\nGraham, and one count of attempted murder for the shooting of Billups. The aggravated\nmurder count contained a capital specification alleging that the shooting was part of a\ncourse of conduct involving the purposeful killing of or attempt to kill two or more\npersons. See O.R.C. § 2929.04(a)(5). Relying on the advice of trial counsel, Sowell\nwaived his right to a jury trial and opted for trial by a three-judge panel, see O.R.C.\n\fNos. 08-3522/3575              Sowell v. Anderson                                  Page 5\n\n\n§ 2945.06, which unanimously found Sowell guilty of both counts, including the capital\nspecification.\n\n          The defense’s mitigating evidence consisted of an unsworn statement by Sowell,\nthe testimony of five witnesses who knew Sowell as an adult, and the submission of\nseveral psychological reports prepared by court-appointed mental health experts. Also\nbefore the panel was the presentence investigation (PSI) report prepared by the probation\ndepartment. None of this material revealed any substantial details about Sowell’s\nbackground or family history. The panel unanimously sentenced Sowell to death on the\naggravated murder count, and to a term of seven to twenty-five years of imprisonment\non the attempted murder count. Sowell’s conviction and sentence were upheld on direct\nappeal and his petition for state post-conviction relief was unsuccessful at trial and on\nappeal.\n\n          Sowell’s federal habeas petition was initially dismissed without prejudice for\nfailure to exhaust the Ohio Supreme Court’s Murnahan procedure for raising claims of\nineffective assistance of appellate counsel. See State v. Murnahan, 584 N.E.2d 1204,\n1209 (Ohio 1992). After the Ohio courts denied his Murnahan motions, Sowell renewed\nhis federal habeas petition on May 24, 1994, raising fifty-two claims. The district court\nconducted an evidentiary hearing allowing Sowell to develop one of these claims—that\nhis waiver of a jury trial was not knowing and intelligent. Our initial review of Sowell’s\npetition reversed the district court’s conditional grant of habeas relief on that claim.\nSowell v. Bradshaw, 372 F.3d 821, 838 (6th Cir. 2004).\n\n          The district court reopened Sowell’s petition on November 16, 2004, and\naddressed his remaining claims. In a carefully reasoned opinion, the district court found\nthat Sowell received ineffective assistance of counsel during the penalty phase of his\ntrial. Sowell v. Collins, 557 F. Supp. 2d 843 (S.D. Ohio 2008). After reviewing the\nmitigating evidence presented to the three-judge panel, the court compared this with the\nadditional mitigating evidence that was submitted in Sowell’s state post-conviction\npetition. The court noted that “virtually all of the evidence presented [at sentencing]\nconcerned good deeds performed by petitioner during his adult life.” Id. at 852. In\n\fNos. 08-3522/3575             Sowell v. Anderson                                   Page 6\n\n\ncontrast, the court noted, the additional mitigating information concerned evidence that\n“petitioner grew up in extreme poverty and suffered severe abuse and neglect as a child.”\nId. at 852-53.\n\n       The district court found that counsel’s failure to discover this entirely different\ncategory of mitigating evidence was constitutionally deficient performance. Id. at 866-\n71 (citing Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 690 (1984)). Counsel did not\nperform an adequate sentencing-phase investigation, the court reasoned, because they\n“fail[ed] to interview members of petitioner’s family” and “ignored known leads that\nmight have helped them to prepare their case in mitigation.” Id. at 870-71. The district\ncourt found that Sowell was prejudiced by his attorneys’ performance because “a\nreasonable probability exists that the outcome would have been different had more\ndetailed information been presented regarding petitioner’s tragic childhood and social\ndevelopment.” Id. at 871. The court rejected the argument that this evidence was\n“merely cumulative of information that was presented” in the written reports of the\ncourt-appointed experts, because the new information was “significant,” “qualitatively\ndifferent,” and “would have painted an entirely different portrait” of Sowell. Id. at 872.\nThe court granted a conditional writ on Sowell’s ineffective-assistance claim and denied\nrelief on all of the remaining grounds.\n\n       The Government appeals the district court’s conditional grant of habeas relief on\nthe ineffective-assistance claim. Sowell cross-appeals, challenging the district court’s\ndismissal of five of his claims: (1) ineffective assistance of counsel during the trial’s\nguilt phase; (2) violation of Sowell’s due process rights based on an ex parte meeting\nbetween the presiding judge and members of the probation department; (3) certain\nalleged sentencing errors; (4) insufficient evidence to support his convictions; and\n(5) suppression of exculpatory evidence by the prosecution. For substantially the\nreasons set out by the district court, the grant of a conditional writ on the claim that\ncounsel were ineffective during the penalty-phase proceeding was proper, and Sowell’s\nremaining grounds for habeas relief are without merit.\n\fNos. 08-3522/3575             Sowell v. Anderson                                    Page 7\n\n\n                                            II.\n\n       This case is not governed by the strict limits on federal habeas review imposed\nby the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA). Because\nSowell filed his habeas petition in 1994, the pre-AEDPA standard of review applies.\nSowell, 372 F.3d at 828. Under this standard, a state court’s factual findings are entitled\nto a presumption of correctness that is rebuttable by convincing evidence, McQueen v.\nScroggy, 99 F.3d 1302, 1310 (6th Cir. 1996), while the state court’s determination of\nquestions of federal law or mixed questions of federal law and fact are reviewed de\nnovo, Coleman v. Mitchell, 244 F.3d 533, 538 (6th Cir. 2001). The pre-AEDPA\nstandard of review “entitle[s] [Sowell] to have the federal habeas court make its own\nindependent determination of his federal claim, without being bound by the\ndetermination on the merits of that claim reached in the state proceedings.” Wainwright\nv. Sykes, 433 U.S. 72, 87 (1977).\n\n            A. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel During the Penalty Phase\n\n       Application of this standard leads to the conclusion that Sowell received\nineffective assistance during the penalty phase of his capital trial. Trial counsel failed\nto uncover and present evidence of Sowell’s deprived and abusive childhood, which left\nthe sentencing panel unaware of a substantial body of mitigating evidence that could\nhave led at least one of the judges to vote against the death penalty. Because we uphold\nthe district court’s determination that counsel’s failure to conduct an adequate\nsentencing-phase investigation fell short of constitutional standards, it is not necessary\nto address Sowell’s other arguments that his counsel’s performance during the penalty\nphase was deficient.\n\n                                1. Deficient performance\n\n       Sowell’s attorneys performed deficiently because they did not interview Sowell’s\nfamily members or investigate references to his horrific childhood contained in the\nreports of court-appointed mental health experts. Counsel’s failure to interview Sowell’s\nfamily was inconsistent with their obligation to conduct a thorough sentencing-phase\n\fNos. 08-3522/3575            Sowell v. Anderson                                   Page 8\n\n\ninvestigation, see Porter v. McCollum, 130 S. Ct. 447, 453 (2009) (per curiam), and was\nunreasonable in light of the “leads” contained in the experts’ reports, which should have\nprompted counsel to investigate further, see Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510, 534 (2003).\nBecause they were not aware of this additional mitigating evidence, Sowell’s attorneys\nwere not in a position to make a conscious, strategic decision about the type of\nmitigation case to present at sentencing.\n\n       Counsel’s mitigation strategy at sentencing was to present Sowell as a good\nperson who lost his temper because he felt betrayed by his friend Graham. The\nmitigation evidence consisted of Sowell’s unsworn statement, the testimony of five\nwitnesses—Lenora Waugh, two probation officers, and two work colleagues—who\nknew Sowell as an adult, and the submission of several competency and capacity\nevaluations. As the district court noted, almost all of the testimony involved good deeds\nSowell had done as an adult. Sowell, 557 F. Supp. 2d at 852. The witnesses gave\nspecific examples of times when Sowell had helped them in need and had attempted to\nprevent crimes in his community.       They testified that Sowell was kind-hearted,\ntrustworthy, a hard worker, and a good father. The psychological reports likewise\ndescribed Sowell as “a most righteous man with a high moral sense” who was “proud\nof his good works.” But their discussion of Sowell’s background was perfunctory, and\nnone of the witnesses shed any light on Sowell’s childhood or family history. Direct\nexamination of the six witnesses totaled only thirty-four pages of transcript. Counsel\nfailed to call any family members to testify, and the panel did not learn anything\nsubstantial about Sowell’s formative years.\n\n       There is nothing wrong with a mitigation strategy that emphasizes a capital\ndefendant’s redeeming qualities. But Sowell’s attorneys did not make a conscious\nchoice among available alternative strategies because they overlooked an entire category\nof compelling mitigating evidence—evidence that might have caused the sentencing\npanel to rethink its assessment of Sowell’s moral culpability. Counsel’s failure to\npresent evidence of Sowell’s horrific childhood resulted from their ignorance of this\nevidence, not from an informed choice between mutually exclusive mitigation theories.\n\fNos. 08-3522/3575             Sowell v. Anderson                                     Page 9\n\n\nSowell’s attorneys failed to uncover this additional mitigating evidence—and therefore\nperformed deficiently—for two reasons.\n\n        First, counsel did not interview any of Sowell’s family members, including his\nfather, brothers, sisters, and other relatives. Affidavits of fourteen family members and\nfriends accompanied Sowell’s state post-conviction petition, recounting the violence and\nprivation of Sowell’s childhood. Many of these witnesses stated that they would have\nbeen available and willing to testify at the penalty phase but had not been asked to do\nso. Sowell’s attorneys did not contact a single member of his immediate family, and\nonly Sowell’s father spoke with the social worker who compiled information for the\npsychological evaluations.\n\n        Counsel’s failure to interview Sowell’s family fell short of the “reasonable”\ninvestigation required by the Sixth Amendment, as well as the then-prevailing standards\n“articulated by the American Bar Association (ABA)—standards to which we long have\nreferred as ‘guides to determining what is reasonable.’” Wiggins, 539 U.S. at 524\n(quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 688)). As in Porter, “[i]t is unquestioned that under the\nprevailing professional norms at the time of [defendant’s] trial, counsel had an\n‘obligation to conduct a thorough investigation of the defendant’s background.’” 130\nS. Ct. at 452 (quoting Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362, 396 (2000)). These standards\nrequired counsel to make efforts to “‘explore all avenues leading to facts relevant to . . .\nthe penalty in the event of conviction,’” including evidence of Sowell’s “‘background,\neducation, . . . family relationships, and the like.’” Bobby v. Van Hook, 130 S. Ct. 13,\n17 (2009) (quoting 1 ABA Standards for Criminal Justice 4-4.1, at 4-53 (2d ed. 1980)).\nIn choosing not to interview Sowell’s family members, his attorneys failed in their\nobligation to conduct a “thorough” investigation.\n\n        Of course, these professional standards did not require Sowell’s attorneys to\ncontact every person who ever knew Sowell during every period of his life, and “there\ncomes a point at which evidence from more distant relatives can reasonably be expected\nto be only cumulative, and the search for it distractive from more important duties.” Van\nHook, 130 S. Ct. at 19 (2009). But Sowell’s attorneys stopped well short of that point.\n\fNos. 08-3522/3575              Sowell v. Anderson                                   Page 10\n\n\nWhile there is a “strong presumption that counsel’s conduct falls within the wide range\nof reasonable professional assistance,” Strickland, 466 U.S. at 689, “strategic choices\nmade after less than complete investigation are reasonable precisely to the extent that\nreasonable professional judgments support the limitations on investigation,” Wiggins,\n539 U.S. at 528 (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 690-91). An attorney does not make\na strategic decision by choosing to ignore a body of evidence, the contents of which are\nunknown. That is not strategy.\n\n        Because counsel did not interview Sowell’s family members, the panel did not\nlearn that Sowell’s early life was abusive, impoverished, and totally chaotic. The\naffidavits of Sowell’s father, brothers, sisters, and family friends describe in vivid detail\nthe physical and psychological abuse Sowell endured as a child. Sowell’s father was a\nserious alcoholic who beat his wife and children on a regular basis. His father was\nfrequently absent for long periods of time, but when he was home, the family lived in\nterror. To avoid setting off a drunken outburst, Sowell and his siblings would not speak\nwhile their father was home. Sowell’s mother was only 15 years old when she got\nmarried. She lacked basic parenting skills and vocally wished her children were dead\nor had never been born. She was petrified of Sowell’s father and would not defend the\nchildren from his drunken beatings. To escape the domestic violence, she often fled the\nhome, leaving the children without supervision for days at a time. Sowell’s parents\neventually divorced, but Sowell and his siblings remained with their father. The abuse\ncontinued into Sowell’s adolescent years. On one occasion, Sowell’s father tied him and\nhis sister JoAnn to a chair and beat them until a neighbor intervened. Sowell’s father\nalso sexually molested Sowell’s sister Catherine and threatened to pour gasoline over her\nand watch her burn if she reported it.\n\n        The affidavits also paint a picture of extreme poverty. The panel did not learn,\nfor example, that Sowell’s infant brother died of starvation and that Sowell and his\nsiblings had to beg for and steal food. The children were bitten by rats, infected with\nworms, and lacked sufficient clothing and shoes.             The entire family—all six\nchildren—lived in a small trailer and later moved into an unfinished basement that\n\fNos. 08-3522/3575             Sowell v. Anderson                                  Page 11\n\n\nlacked electricity or running water. By the time Sowell was fourteen, he was living in\na junkyard, on his own, in a tent. None of Sowell’s siblings has fared any better in life.\nJoAnn became a prostitute and killed her pimp. She died a week before the murder in\nthis case. Larry Sowell shot his brother Benny and served time for manslaughter. Benny\nand Henderson Sowell, Jr. were both incarcerated for burglary. Four of the five children\nwho survived were alcohol or drug addicts. “[A] competent attorney, aware of this\nhistory, would have introduced it at sentencing,” Wiggins, 539 U.S. at 535, and counsel’s\nfailure to do so here was deficient.\n\n       Second, counsel failed to uncover compelling evidence of Sowell’s background\nbecause they did not follow up on the obvious leads contained in the written reports of\ncourt-appointed experts.       “In assessing the reasonableness of an attorney’s\ninvestigation, . . . a court must consider not only the quantum of evidence already known\nto counsel, but also whether the known evidence would lead a reasonable attorney to\ninvestigate further.” Wiggins, 539 U.S. at 527. The question is “whether counsel\nadequately followed up on the ‘leads’ that were available to them,” Haliym v. Mitchell,\n492 F.3d 680, 712 (6th Cir. 2007), or whether counsel instead “abandon[ed] their\ninvestigation at an unreasonable juncture,” Wiggins, 539 U.S. at 527. Our decision in\nHarries v. Bell, 417 F.3d 631 (6th Cir. 2005), illustrates the point. In that case, we held\nthat interviews conducted by counsel “produced viable leads regarding Harries’s poor\nmental health and troubled family background,” and held that “[c]ounsel’s failure to\nfollow these promising leads . . . was deficient.” Id. at 639.\n\n       Here, the psychological reports would have prompted a reasonable attorney to\nexpand the investigation beyond the redeeming aspects of Sowell’s adult life. The\ndistrict court summarized the indications of Sowell’s troubled childhood in these reports\nas follows:\n\n       Dr. [Nancy] Schmidtgoessling’s mitigation report noted that petitioner\n       had a “rough childhood” and “an unhappy home life.” She reported that\n       petitioner experienced a “lack of adequate food, clothing and material\n       goods as well as [a] lack of close parental nurturance.” According to her\n       report, petitioner felt “abandoned, angry, without significant stable\n       relationships, and conscious of the need to defend himself in a dangerous,\n\fNos. 08-3522/3575             Sowell v. Anderson                                 Page 12\n\n\n       hostile environment.” She relayed that petitioner was “on his own” at a\n       young age, that he skipped school, and that he ran away for days at a\n       time. Dr. Schmidtgoessling noted petitioner’s history of depression and\n       alcohol abuse. Likewise, Dr. [James] Titchener reported that petitioner’s\n       mother was distant, that she frequently left her family, and that her\n       abandonment was responsible for much of the anger and hostility\n       petitioner experienced. Dr. [William] Walters noted that petitioner’s\n       father was a “strict disciplinarian” and that the Sowell family was very\n       poor. Walters, Schmidtgoessling, Titchener and [Dr. Emmett] Cooper all\n       noted that alcohol and marijuana use contributed to that events leading\n       up to the murder.\n\nSowell, 557 F. Supp. 2d at 869. These hints of a childhood filled with privation and\nabuse should have moved Sowell’s attorneys to expand the scope of their investigation.\nInstead, Sowell’s attorneys “ignored pertinent avenues for investigation of which [they]\nshould have been aware.” Porter, 130 S. Ct. at 453.\n\n       The Supreme Court’s decision in Wiggins strongly supports the district court’s\nconclusion that counsel performed deficiently in failing to follow up on these leads. In\nWiggins, counsel abandoned their investigation of Wiggins’ background “after having\nacquired only rudimentary knowledge of his history from a narrow set of sources.”\n539 U.S. at 524. The PSI report and Department of Social Services (DSS) records that\ncounsel obtained revealed that Wiggins’ mother was a chronic alcoholic; that Wiggins\nwas “shuttled from foster home to foster home and displayed some emotional\ndifficulties” while there; that he had “frequent, lengthy absences” from school; and that,\n“on at least one occasion, his mother left him and his siblings alone for days without\nfood.” Id. at 525. Despite these promising leads, counsel did not investigate further.\nThe Supreme Court held that “any reasonably competent attorney would have realized\nthat pursuing these leads was necessary to making an informed choice among possible\ndefenses.” Id. at 525. “Counsel’s decision not to expand their investigation beyond the\nPSI and DSS records” was “unreasonable in light of what counsel actually discovered\nin the DSS records.” Id. at 524.\n\n       More recently in Porter, 130 S. Ct. at 453, the Supreme Court held that counsel’s\nfailure to interview the defendant’s family members and obtain school, medical, or\n\fNos. 08-3522/3575             Sowell v. Anderson                                 Page 13\n\n\nmilitary service records was constitutionally deficient. Id. Like the counsel in Wiggins,\nPorter’s attorney did not follow up on leads contained in court-ordered competency\nevaluations, which “collectively reported Porter’s very few years of regular school, his\nmilitary service and wounds sustained in combat, and his father’s ‘over-discipline[e].’”\nId. This court has also recently found deficient performance where defense counsel did\nnot follow up on leads developed from a narrow set of sources. Goodwin v. Johnson,\n632 F.3d 301 (6th Cir. 2011). In that case, defense counsel interviewed some of\nGoodwin’s family members, but did not contact his mother, sister, neighbors and friends,\nor the mother of Goodwin’s child. We held that “[t]he information Goodwin’s counsel\npossessed, obviously incomplete, should have triggered a more thorough investigation\nof Goodwin’s past.” Id. at 324.\n\n       As the district court recognized, “[t]his is not a case where counsel presented\nabsolutely no evidence in mitigation.” Sowell, 557 F. Supp. 2d at 871. The evidence\ncounsel did present was intended to draw out the redeeming qualities that made Sowell’s\nlife worth sparing. But counsel’s decision to emphasize Sowell’s worthwhile adult life\nwhile leaving out his horrific childhood is not easily considered a reasonable mitigation\nstrategy, particularly where the additional evidence would not have been inconsistent\nwith—and might even have strengthened—the mitigation case counsel did present. “The\nevidence concerning petitioner’s horrific upbringing that counsel failed to present would\nhave bolstered their mitigation case by demonstrating that petitioner was capable of\ngenerosity and good acts in spite of the upbringing that he endured.” Id. at 872. This\ncase is therefore different from Sears v. Upton, 130 S. Ct. 3259, 3261-62 (2010) (per\ncuriam), where counsel’s mitigation strategy of emphasizing Sears’ “stable, loving,” and\n“privileged” childhood backfired when the prosecutor used this evidence to argue that\nSears was even more culpable than he would have been had he grown up as a “deprived\nchild from the inner city . . . who[m] society ha[d] turned its back on at an early age.”\n\n       More importantly, even if a decision to “emphasize the good rather than the bad”\nwere a reasonable mitigation strategy in the abstract, Sowell, 557 F. Supp. 2d at 871, it\nwas not reasonable in this case because counsel were not fully aware of their options.\n\fNos. 08-3522/3575            Sowell v. Anderson                                 Page 14\n\n\nThe Supreme Court has found deficient performance even in “cases in which counsel\npresented what could be described as a superficially reasonable mitigation theory during\nthe penalty phase.” Sears, 130 S. Ct. at 3266. Thus, notwithstanding the mitigation case\ncounsel did present, our “principal concern in deciding whether counsel exercised\nreasonable professional judgment is whether the investigation supporting counsel’s\ndecision not to introduce mitigation evidence of [defendant’s] background was itself\nreasonable.” Wiggins, 539 U.S. at 523 (emphasis in original). In this case, as in\nWiggins, “counsel were not in a position to make a reasonable strategic\nchoice . . . because the investigation supporting their choice was unreasonable.” Id. at\n536.\n\n       As the district court explained, this is also not a case where counsel could have\nlegitimately feared that digging deeper into Sowell’s past would turn up evidence that\nwas more damaging than favorable. Sowell, 557 F. Supp. 2d at 873. Sowell’s entire\ncriminal record and arrest history were included in the PSI report and the mental health\nevaluations that were submitted to the panel at sentencing. The psychological reports\nalso thoroughly documented Sowell’s short temper and his propensity for responding\nviolently to perceived injustices, especially when drinking. Thus, the panel already\nknew the worst. Further investigation could only have helped Sowell. This case\ntherefore differs from Wood v. Allen, 130 S. Ct. 841, 847-49 (2010), where counsel had\nmade a strategic decision not to investigate Wood’s mental deficiencies, despite having\navailable a favorable expert report on the matter, because the report also contained\ndetails about Wood’s 19 earlier arrests and his attempt to murder a prior ex-\ngirlfriend—rebuttal evidence that counsel had been successful in excluding at trial. Id.\nat 850 n.3. Sowell’s case is also different from Burger v. Kemp, 483 U.S. 776, 794\n(1987), in which a limited investigation was reasonable because all potential witnesses\ninterviewed by counsel provided information that was more harmful than helpful.\nWithout knowledge of the mitigating side of Sowell’s background, his attorneys could\nnot have made a conscious, strategic judgment that this evidence would do more harm\nthan good.\n\fNos. 08-3522/3575            Sowell v. Anderson                                  Page 15\n\n\n                                      2. Prejudice\n\n       Turning to the second prong of Strickland, Sowell was prejudiced by his\nattorneys’ performance because, as the district court found, “there is a reasonable\nlikelihood that at least one member of the three-judge panel would have voted in favor\nof a sentence less than death if the panel had been informed of Sowell’s dysfunctional\nchildhood.” Sowell, 557 F.3d at 866. The additional mitigating evidence differs in\nstrength and in subject matter from the evidence the panel heard, and the evidence is\ntherefore not cumulative. And far from being inconsistent with counsel’s mitigation\nstrategy, the information concerning Sowell’s background would have strengthened\ncounsel’s mitigation theory that Sowell was a good person because it was highly relevant\nto any assessment of his moral worth.\n\n       To establish prejudice, Sowell must demonstrate that there is a reasonable\nprobability that, but for counsel’s errors, the result of the proceeding would have been\ndifferent. See Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694. “In assessing prejudice, we reweigh the\nevidence in aggravation against the totality of available mitigating evidence.” Wiggins,\n539 U.S. at 534. Thus, in a capital case, “the question is whether there is a reasonable\nprobability that, absent the errors, the sentencer—including an appellate court, to the\nextent it independently reweighs the evidence—would have concluded that the balance\nof aggravating and mitigating circumstances did not warrant death.” Strickland, 466\nU.S. at 695. Additional mitigating evidence that is “merely cumulative” of that already\npresented does not undermine the results of sentencing. Broom v. Mitchell, 441 F.3d\n392, 410 (6th Cir. 2006). Instead, “the new evidence . . . must differ in a substantial\nway—in strength and subject matter—from the evidence actually presented at\nsentencing.” Tibbetts v. Bradshaw, 633 F.3d 436, 444 (6th Cir. 2011) (internal\nquotations omitted).\n\n       Here, the additional mitigating evidence is sufficient to “undermine confidence\nin the outcome” of Sowell’s sentencing proceeding. See Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694.\nAs in Williams, 529 U.S. at 398, “the graphic description of [defendant’s] childhood,\nfilled with abuse and privation, . . . might well have influenced the [panel’s] appraisal\n\fNos. 08-3522/3575             Sowell v. Anderson                                  Page 16\n\n\nof his moral culpability.” Though the mitigating evidence regarding Sowell’s childhood\nis extensive, the panel heard only about Sowell’s adult life. The testimony at sentencing\nsupports counsel’s theory that Sowell’s life had residual value. But what is key to the\nprejudice inquiry is the evidence the panel did not hear—specific details about Sowell’s\n“nightmarish” childhood. See id. at 395.\n\n       This evidence is not merely cumulative. There is no question that the additional\nmitigating evidence is stronger than anything the panel learned about Sowell’s\nbackground from the written reports of Drs. Schmidtgoessling, Titchener, and Walters.\nThese reports spoke in generalities that lacked any details of the severe abuse and abject\npoverty Sowell experienced as a child, or any “graphic descriptions” of the atmosphere\nof violence that permeated his formative years. See id. at 398. In contrast, Sowell’s\nfamily members offered first-hand, eyewitness accounts of specific examples of extreme\npoverty and abuse. These specifics had far more evidentiary power than the abstractions\nand oblique references contained in the experts’ written reports.\n\n       What is more, the experts themselves never heard any of these details when they\nconducted their evaluations. Drs. Schmidtgoessling, Titchener, and Cooper interviewed\nonly Sowell and had no contact with his family members. Only the social worker who\ncompiled information for Dr. Walters’ pretrial examination had any contact with\nSowell’s family, and she spoke only with Sowell’s father—a source who had good\nreason to withhold the most compelling examples of abuse Sowell and his siblings\nendured as children. The reports of Drs. Titchener and Walters were not prepared for\nmitigation purposes, and there is nothing in Dr. Cooper’s report about Sowell’s\nbackground. These experts were appointed to evaluate Sowell’s competence to stand\ntrial and his mental capacity for purposes of exploring an insanity defense, and to the\nextent their reports discuss Sowell’s background at all, they are drawn from an even\nnarrower set of sources than those available to defense counsel.\n\n       The subject matter of the additional mitigating evidence is different as well. The\ngood deeds Sowell had done as an adult provide an incomplete picture of his moral\nworth. Sowell’s actions as an adult—good and bad—are merely a snapshot in time,\n\fNos. 08-3522/3575             Sowell v. Anderson                                  Page 17\n\n\nunilluminated by the longitudinal perspective that his developmental history provides.\n“[E]vidence about the defendant’s background and character is relevant because of the\nbelief, long held by this society, that defendants who commit criminal acts that are\nattributable to a disadvantaged background . . . may be less culpable.” Penry v.\nLynaugh, 492 U.S. 302, 319 (1989) (internal quotations omitted). Moreover, Sowell’s\ngood deeds might have been written off as isolated incidents or attributed to ulterior\nmotives by a sentencing judge disinclined to see Sowell as a basically good person. But\nthe additional mitigating evidence is of more than a few scattered incidents. It is\nevidence of a lifetime of privation and abuse, beginning in early childhood and\ncontinuing throughout the formative years of Sowell’s life.\n\n       The evidence the panel did not hear—specific details about Sowell’s horrific\nchildhood—is often the kind of evidence that undermines a court’s confidence in the\noutcome of a capital sentencing proceeding. In Williams, 529 U.S. at 395, the Supreme\nCourt found prejudice where counsel failed to present evidence that Williams had a\n“nightmarish” childhood, that his “parents were imprisoned for the criminal neglect” of\ntheir children, and that Williams “had been severely and repeatedly beaten by his\nfather.” Similarly in Wiggins, 539 U.S. at 535, the Court found prejudice where counsel\nfailed to discover “powerful” evidence of “severe privation and abuse in the first six\nyears of [Wiggins’] life while in the custody of his alcoholic, absentee mother,” as well\nas evidence of “physical torment, sexual molestation, and repeated rape during his\nsubsequent years in foster care.” Again in Rompilla v. Beard, 545 U.S. 374, 392-93\n(2005), the Court found prejudice where counsel failed to present evidence that Rompilla\nwas reared in abject poverty and suffered extreme physical and psychological abuse,\nwhich included being “locked . . . [with] his brother Richard in a small wire mesh dog\npen that was filthy and excrement filled.” And in Porter, 130 S. Ct. at 449, the Court\nfound prejudicial counsel’s failure to present evidence of Porter’s “abusive childhood”\nand “horrible family life,” including an incident in which “Porter’s father shot at him for\ncoming home late, but missed and just beat Porter instead,” and another in which\nPorter’s mother was beaten “so severely that she had to go to the hospital and lost a\nchild.” Most recently in Sears, 130 S. Ct. at 3262, the Court found prejudicial counsel’s\n\fNos. 08-3522/3575              Sowell v. Anderson                                   Page 18\n\n\nfailure to present evidence that Sears’ home life was “physically abusive” and that he\n“suffered sexual abuse at the hands of an adolescent male cousin.”\n\n        A finding that Sowell was prejudiced by his attorneys’ failure to develop and\npresent exactly this kind of mitigating evidence is therefore squarely in line with the\nSupreme Court decisions addressing ineffective assistance during the penalty phase of\na capital trial. Our court has also repeatedly found that ignorance of specifics about a\ndefendant’s formative years undermines confidence in the outcome of a capital\nsentencing proceeding. Most recently in Goodwin, 632 F.3d at 329, we deemed\nprejudicial counsel’s failure to present evidence that Goodwin suffered “severe privation\nand abuse in the early years of his life and while in the custody of his alcoholic and drug\nusing mother,” including evidence that he was “frequently beaten, sexually molested,\nand abandoned by both of his parents.” Likewise in Mason v. Mitchell, 543 F.3d 766,\n780 (6th Cir. 2008), this court held that the petitioner was prejudiced where counsel did\nnot present evidence of Mason’s “abusive and unhealthy” childhood, including evidence\nthat his parents were “daily drug users as well as traffickers,” that his mother “shot at his\nfather because of his involvement with prostitution,” and that Mason’s parents “regularly\nabused Mason and isolated all of their children from anyone not associated with the\nparents’ drug dealing activities.” And in Harries, 417 F.3d at 639, we upheld the district\ncourt’s finding of prejudice where counsel failed to discover evidence that Harries\nsuffered “significant physical abuse” during his “traumatic” childhood, including an\nincident in which he was “hit . . . on the head with a frying pan,” and another in which\nhe was “choked so severely that his eyes hemorrhaged.”\n\n        In short, like the additional mitigating evidence presented in these cases,\nevidence of Sowell’s severely impoverished and abusive childhood is not merely\ncumulative of that presented at sentencing. This is also not a case in which the omitted\nevidence “would have triggered admission of . . . powerful [aggravating] evidence in\nrebuttal.” Wong v. Belmontes, 130 S. Ct. 383, 387-88 (2009) (per curiam). In\nBelmontes, defense counsel “built his mitigation strategy around the overriding need to\nexclude” evidence that Belmontes had committed a prior murder. Id. at 385. The\n\fNos. 08-3522/3575                  Sowell v. Anderson                                          Page 19\n\n\nSupreme Court held that counsel’s decision not to use expert testimony to “humanize”\nBelmontes was not prejudicial, because the expert testimony would have opened the\ndoor to evidence of the prior murder kept out only by counsel’s vigilance. Id. at 388; see\nalso Wood, 130 S. Ct. at 850 n.3. Here, the panel already knew the most damaging\ninformation about Sowell’s background from the PSI and psychological reports, and\nadditional mitigating evidence could only have tipped the balance in favor of leniency.\n\n         We recognize that the prejudice question in this case is close, and that the Ohio\ncourts had a different view of the impact defense counsel’s performance had on Sowell’s\nsentencing proceeding. However, under the pre-AEDPA standard that applies to this\ncase, the federal courts must make their “own independent determination of [Sowell’s]\nfederal claim,” and are not bound by the state courts’ view. Wainwright, 433 U.S. at 87.\nFor these reasons, the district court properly found that there is a reasonable probability\nthat a three-judge panel presented with evidence of Sowell’s extensive abuse and neglect\nwould have returned a different sentence.\n\n         Accordingly, Sowell is entitled to relief on his claim that trial counsel provided\nineffective assistance during the penalty phase of his capital trial. Because counsel’s\nfailure to investigate compelling mitigating evidence constitutes ineffective assistance\nwarranting resentencing, it is not necessary to address the other sentencing issues raised\nin the habeas petition concerning the imposition of the death penalty, including whether\ncounsel’s failure to obtain “reasonable and necessary” experts constitutes ineffective\nassistance, whether the three-judge panel erred in applying the wrong weighing standard\nduring sentencing, and whether the presiding judge’s ex parte communication with the\nprobation department rendered the death sentence constitutionally infirm.1 We now turn\nto issues raised by Sowell concerning the guilt phase of his trial.\n\n\n\n\n         1\n          To the extent that this claim can be read as a challenge not only to Sowell’s sentence but also\nto his conviction, we reject it for the reasons given by the district court. Sowell, 557 F.3d at 893-97.\n\fNos. 08-3522/3575               Sowell v. Anderson                                   Page 20\n\n\n                                             III.\n\n                 A. Prosecution’s Suppression of Exculpatory Evidence\n\n         Sowell claims that the prosecution failed to disclose material exculpatory\nevidence, as required by Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963). This claim is without\nmerit for the reasons given by the district court. Sowell, 557 F. Supp. 2d at 907-09.\nSowell argues that prosecutors suppressed the statement of Jerrell Perrin, an eyewitness\nwho lived on the same floor of the apartment building as Sowell and Graham. But\nPerrin’s statement is not material and does not create sufficient doubt as to Sowell’s\nguilt.\n\n         In her affidavit filed in the post-conviction proceeding, Perrin testified that on\nthe night of the shooting, she saw Sowell standing outside Graham’s apartment and\nheard him ask Pamela Billups to return his money, and that she heard Billups respond\nby screaming profanities at Sowell. She testified that between twenty and thirty minutes\nlater, she heard what she thought was a car backfiring. When she opened her door, she\nsaw Sowell walking back to his apartment. Perrin testified that she knew Billups was\na prostitute and had a reputation for dishonesty, and that Billups was known for stealing\nmoney from her customers.\n\n         As the district court explained:\n\n         Perrin’s affidavit actually contradicts petitioner’s trial testimony, and the\n         defense theory of the case, in several key respects. Petitioner testified\n         that he did not argue with Billups about his money, yet Perrin’s statement\n         quite clearly states that she heard petitioner and Billups arguing. More\n         importantly, Perrin’s affidavit states that she heard the sounds of gunfire\n         twenty to thirty minutes after the argument. This statement directly\n         contradicts petitioner’s testimony that the shooting happened “far less\n         than five minutes” after he left the apartment, and calls into question the\n         defense theory that this offense was committed without sufficient time\n         to form the intent necessary for prior calculation and design.\n\nSowell, 557 F. Supp. 2d at 908-09. There is therefore not a “reasonable probability that,\nhad the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have\n\fNos. 08-3522/3575             Sowell v. Anderson                                  Page 21\n\n\nbeen different,” Strickler v. Greene, 527 U.S. 263, 280 (1999), and Sowell’s Brady claim\ntherefore fails.\n\n                   B. Sufficiency of the Evidence of Aggravated Murder\n\n        Sowell next argues that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction.\nHe is wrong. Sowell was convicted of aggravated murder, which requires a finding of\nprior calculation and design. See O.R.C. § 2903.03(A)(1). We adopt the careful\nreasoning of the district court to the effect that the evidence presented at trial was\nsufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Sowell acted with prior calculation\nand design. Most pointedly, the district court explained that:\n\n        [T]he shootings did not occur as a result of an instantaneous eruption or\n        one continuous course of events. There was an initial encounter and an\n        exchange of hostile words between petitioner and Billups that generated\n        a decision on petitioner’s part to shoot and kill Billups. After arguing\n        with Billups about whether she had taken his money, petitioner\n        announced his intention to get his gun and kill Billups, and he put into\n        action a plan to achieve that result. To that end, petitioner left Graham’s\n        apartment, went down the hall to his own apartment, and retrieved his\n        gun. Although the period of time that elapsed between the initial\n        encounter and the shootings was brief, there was a break in the\n        encounter, or an intervening period, during which there was a time for\n        reflection and planning. During that time, petitioner retrieved his\n        weapon from a different location and devised a plan to regain entry to\n        Graham’s apartment under false pretenses by using Lenora Waugh.\n        Accordingly, . . . there was sufficient time, under all of the\n        circumstances, for petitioner to plan the killing.\n\nSowell, 557 F. Supp. 2d at 917.\n\n              C. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel During the Guilt Phase\n\n        Finally, Sowell asserts that he received ineffective assistance of counsel during\nthe guilt phase of his trial for four reasons. First, Sowell argues that counsel failed to\nconduct a reasonable pretrial investigation by not interviewing the state’s witnesses.\nSecond, Sowell argues that counsel failed to call Sowell’s neighbor, Jarrell Perrin, as a\ndefense witness. Third, Sowell argues that counsel failed to cross-examine Donna\nEdwards, a key prosecution witness and eyewitness to the shootings. And fourth, Sowell\n\fNos. 08-3522/3575              Sowell v. Anderson                                   Page 22\n\n\nclaims that counsel failed to object to inadmissible evidence concerning Sowell’s\nchildren, a false ceiling in his apartment, and his prior contacts with law enforcement.\nWith respect to each of these arguments, counsel’s performance was not deficient, or if\nit was, Sowell has not shown that the deficiency affected the outcome of his trial.\n\n               1. Counsel’s failure to conduct a reasonable investigation\n\n        Sowell first argues that his attorneys did not conduct a sufficient pretrial\ninvestigation because they failed to interview the state’s witnesses. Again, we adopt the\nreasoning of the district court, which carefully disposed of this argument, relying in part\non the fact that:\n\n        [T]he record reflects that counsel filed for discovery and for a more\n        definite bill of particulars, met with petitioner to discuss his options with\n        respect to the trier of fact, and reviewed the grand jury testimony of at\n        least four witnesses. During a pre-trial hearing, petitioner’s counsel\n        stated on the record that they had met with the prosecutor and reviewed\n        the evidence and photographs. Counsel filed several pre-trial motions,\n        including a motion to suppress the gun found in petitioner’s apartment.\n        Moreover, as the trial court noted, petitioner failed to present any\n        evidence during his post-conviction proceedings suggesting that his\n        counsel did not have copies of the witness statements to police.\n\nSowell, 557 F. Supp. 2d at 883 (citations omitted).\n\n        Sowell cites the Seventh Circuit’s holding in Stanley v. Bartley, 465 F.3d 810,\n813 (7th Cir. 2006), for the proposition that these activities were not enough. But unlike\nthe defendant in Stanley, Sowell was not prejudiced by his attorneys’ failure to interview\nthe state’s witnesses because he has shown no real way in which their testimony would\nindicate his innocence. In Stanley, the state’s key witness, James Dean, who might well\nhave been the murderer, testified that he was with Stanley on the night of the murder and\nthat he saw Stanley shoot the victim in the back. Id. at 811. But other witnesses—who\ndid not testify and whom defense counsel did not interview—told the police that Dean\nand the victim had been involved in a violent quarrel hours before the shooting. Id. at\n812. Here, Sowell admitted shooting Graham and Billups, and the only issue to be\ndecided by the panel was whether Sowell had committed the acts with prior calculation\n\fNos. 08-3522/3575              Sowell v. Anderson                                 Page 23\n\n\nand design. Sowell has presented no evidence that would undermine confidence in the\npanel’s finding of prior calculation and design. Thus, no prejudice has been shown from\ncounsel’s performance in this regard.\n\n                         2. Counsel’s failure to call Jerrell Perrin\n\n        Sowell next argues that counsel failed to call Sowell’s neighbor Perrin as a\ndefense witness. The district court rejected this argument for the same reason it found\nthat Perrin’s statement was not material exculpatory evidence—i.e., “the Perrin affidavit\nsupports, in many respects, the state’s theory of the case, and contradicts petitioner’s\naccount of the events.” Sowell, 557 F. Supp. 2d at 884. The court therefore properly\nconcluded that “the testimony of Perrin . . . would not have affected the outcome of\npetitioner’s trial.” Id. at 885.\n\n                 3. Counsel’s failure to cross-examine Donna Edwards\n\n        The district court’s opinion also properly disposes of Sowell’s argument that trial\ncounsel performed deficiently by failing to cross-examine Donna Edwards, a key\nprosecution witness and eyewitness to the shooting. Sowell maintains that the testimony\nof Edwards—the only individual present in the apartment who was not shot by\nSowell—was inconsistent in several respects with Billups’s testimony, and that counsel\nshould have brought out these inconsistencies on cross-examination. But once again,\nSowell has not established that he was prejudiced by counsel’s failure to do this.\n\n        With respect to counsel’s performance, the district court explained:\n\n        Although Edwards was a witness to the actual shooting, she had little to\n        offer regarding petitioner’s interaction with Billups in the days\n        immediately preceding the shooting. Billups, on the other hand, was\n        subject to lengthy cross-examination by counsel, as counsel attempted to\n        establish that the shootings “were prefaced by a heated, passionate, and\n        emotional exchange between Mr. Sowell and Ms. Billups.” Petitioner’s\n        case was not won or lost by whether counsel could exonerate him as the\n        shooter; rather, counsel’s theory of the case was that petitioner did not\n        act with prior calculation and design, and “[t]he disputed issue centered\n        on what precipitated the shooting.” To that end, counsel delivered an\n        opening statement setting forth a cohesive defense, cross-examined\n\fNos. 08-3522/3575               Sowell v. Anderson                                  Page 24\n\n\n          Billups regarding the alleged theft that was at the center of the dispute,\n          and called petitioner to testify regarding the events in question, his\n          relationship with Billups in the days leading up to the shooting, and his\n          mental state at the time of the offense.\n\nSowell, 557 F. Supp. 2d at 886-87 (citations omitted).\n\n          The district court also properly reasoned that there was no prejudice in this\nregard:\n\n          Even if counsel would have highlighted the inconsistencies between\n          Edwards’ testimony and that of Billups, those inconsistencies concerned\n          somewhat collateral matters. What remains consistent with respect to the\n          testimony of the two women is that petitioner threatened to shoot Billups,\n          left the apartment to retrieve a gun from his own apartment down the\n          hall, enlisted the assistance of Lenora Waugh to regain entry into the\n          apartment, entered the apartment with force, shot Graham\n          twice—including a fatal close range shot to his head, then went to where\n          Billups was hiding in a closet and fired three shots into her body at close\n          range, stopping only when he ran out of ammunition. With respect to\n          these essential facts, the testimony of Edwards and Billups was\n          consistent, and petitioner cannot meet the prejudice prong of Strickland.\n\nId. at 887.\n\n                  4. Counsel’s failure to object to inadmissible evidence\n\n          Finally, Sowell argues that trial counsel’s performance was deficient because\ncounsel failed to object to inadmissible evidence. Sowell claims that counsel failed to\nobject to questions by the prosecutor during Sowell’s cross-examination concerning\nwhether he conceived children out of wedlock, whether he had a false ceiling in his\napartment, and whether he had prior contacts with the Cincinnati Police Department.\nThe district court properly held that these claims were procedurally defaulted because\nthey were never presented to the state courts. Sowell, 557 F. Supp. 2d at 888. The state\nmaintains that position on appeal, and Sowell does not respond to the procedural default\nargument.\n\fNos. 08-3522/3575           Sowell v. Anderson                             Page 25\n\n\n                                         IV.\n\n      For these reasons, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n\fNos. 08-3522/3575             Sowell v. Anderson                                  Page 26\n\n\n         _______________________________________________________\n\n            CONCURRING IN PART AND DISSENTING IN PART\n         _______________________________________________________\n\n       ALICE M. BATCHELDER, Chief Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in\npart. I agree that the district court did not err in denying habeas relief on nearly all of\nSowell’s claims. However, I must respectfully dissent from the portion of the majority\nopinion affirming the grant of habeas relief on the basis of ineffective assistance of\ncounsel at the penalty phase. On the record before us, we cannot say either that counsel\nfailed to investigate sufficiently, or that counsel pursued a constitutionally deficient\nmitigation strategy. Sowell has presented fourteen affidavits of family and friends,\nsetting forth testimony about his childhood, his family dynamics, his work history, and\nhis adult life. However, only one of those affidavits—that of Sowell’s father—is of any\nhelp to Sowell’s case, and even then, only marginally so.\n\n       Sowell’s argument is that counsel did not adequately investigate and therefore\ncould not have made a strategic decision to omit certain mitigating evidence at the\nsentencing phase. In these types of cases, it is obviously not enough to merely present\nan affidavit containing testimony that was not introduced during the penalty phase. The\ntestimony must also be useful. See Brooks v. Bagley, 513 F.3d 618, 630 (6th Cir. 2008)\n(rejecting probative value of affidavit that did not specify what new information\nwitnesses would have provided); Martin v. Mitchell, 280 F.3d 594, 614 (6th Cir. 2002)\n(finding no prejudice where “affidavits of [petitioner’s] family members state their\nwillingness to testify at his sentencing but do not show what mitigating evidence would\nhave been presented had they testified”); see also Hill v. Mitchell, 400 F.3d 308, 319\n(6th Cir. 2005) (“[T]he new evidence that a habeas petitioner presents must differ in a\nsubstantial way—in strength and subject matter—from the evidence actually presented\nat sentencing.”). The affidavit must state that the affiant would have been willing to\ntestify, because otherwise the trial court would never hear the relevant testimony. See\nTurner v. Romanowski, No. 07-2352, 2011 WL 383014, at *6 (6th Cir. Feb. 8, 2011)\n(“Turner has not produced an affidavit from Ms. Matthews herself indicating that she\n\fNos. 08-3522/3575              Sowell v. Anderson                                   Page 27\n\n\nwould be willing to testify on Turner’s behalf . . . .”); Coe v. Bell, 161 F.3d 320, 342 (6th\nCir. 1998) (rejecting ineffective assistance claim where “most . . . witnesses were\nunavailable or would not cooperate with counsel at the time of pre-trial preparation”).\nAnd to show that counsel conducted an inadequate investigation, the affidavit must at\nleast state that counsel never spoke with the affiant. Cf. Goodwin v. Johnson, 632 F.3d\n301, 324 (6th Cir. 2011) (“The rest of Goodwin’s family—including his mother, his\nsister, his neighbor, his friend, and the mother of his child—testified that at no time\nduring the trial did attorneys or investigators try to contact them or ask them to testify\non Goodwin’s behalf.”); Morales v. Mitchell, 507 F.3d 916, 932 (6th Cir. 2007) (affiants\nstated that they would have been willing to testify but counsel never contacted them).\nWithout the affiant’s stating that he had not been contacted by counsel, we have no way\nof knowing if the absence of the testimony was the product of an informed strategic\ndecision by counsel or the result of deficient performance.\n\n        The majority opinion glosses over the characteristics of each individual affidavit,\ndescribing them collectively with broad, summary language: “Affidavits of fourteen\nfamily members and friends accompanied Sowell’s state post-conviction petition,\nrecounting the violence and privation of Sowell’s childhood. Many of these witnesses\nstated that they would have been available and willing to testify at the penalty phase but\nhad not been asked to do so.” In fact, only eight of the affidavits have anything to say\nabout Sowell’s childhood. Of those, only one offers any helpful testimony and states\nthat counsel never contacted the affiant.\n\n        In order to avoid the majority’s error, I will examine the affidavits individually,\nnot as an indistinguishable mass of potential mitigation testimony. Sowell submitted\nseveral affidavits from immediate family members: Henderson Sowell, Sr. (father);\nHenderson Sowell, Jr. (brother); Larry Sowell (brother); and Catherine Jones (sister).\nHe submitted affidavits from his wife and other family members: Lenora Waugh\n(common law wife); Bobby Lee Horton (great uncle); Helen Sanderful (aunt); Ann\nSimpson (aunt). He submitted an affidavit from a childhood friend: Kenneth Starks.\nLastly, he submitted affidavits from friends and acquaintances from his adult life: Adam\n\fNos. 08-3522/3575                    Sowell v. Anderson                                           Page 28\n\n\nHuntley (employer); Leroy Jones (friend); Jerrell Perrin (neighbor); Jimmy Wilcox\n(co-worker); and Walter Gabennesh (employer). In all, Sowell submitted fourteen\naffidavits’ worth of information that counsel was allegedly ineffective for failing to\ndiscover. However, very little of it goes towards establishing ineffective assistance of\ncounsel, some of it is not helpful for mitigation, and some of it undercuts his mitigation\ncase.\n\n         The only argument Sowell advances, and the only one that has ever gained\ntraction in a federal court, is that counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate and\npresent evidence concerning Sowell’s difficult childhood. Therefore, any testimony\npresented in the fourteen affidavits regarding Sowell’s adult life is not relevant to\nSowell’s claim. Sowell never argues to the contrary. Waugh, Huntley, Leroy Jones,\nPerrin, Wilcox, and Gabennesh knew Sowell only in his adult life, and their testimony\ndoes not shed light on anything new from his childhood, so those affidavits are not\nvaluable.1\n\n         Of the remaining eight affiants, the only ones to actually state that Sowell’s\nattorneys never contacted them are his father, Henderson Sowell, Sr., and his aunt, Ann\nSimpson. None of the others state that counsel never spoke with them.2 In light of this,\nthe majority opinion’s statement that, “[C]ounsel did not interview any of Sowell’s\nfamily members, including his father, brothers, sisters, and other relatives,” is quite an\noverstatement.\n\n         Because the affidavits of the six other relevant affiants are silent on the matter,\nwe cannot assume that trial counsel never spoke with them. This is simply a matter of\nrecognizing where the burden of proof lies—with Sowell, the petitioner. See Strickland\nv. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687 (1984); Fautenberry v. Mitchell, 515 F.3d 614, 634\n(6th Cir. 2008); Higgins v. Renico, 470 F.3d 624, 632 (6th Cir. 2006) (“In essence, a\ndefendant has the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that counsel\n\n         1\n             Furthermore, Waugh actually did testify at the sentencing phase.\n         2\n          Even Larry Sowell, petitioner’s brother, states only that he was not asked to testify. He does not\nsay anything about whether or not counsel ever spoke with him.\n\fNos. 08-3522/3575                     Sowell v. Anderson                                              Page 29\n\n\nmade errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the counsel guaranteed the\ndefendant by the Sixth Amendment.” (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)).\nThe silence of the relevant affidavits on whether or not counsel ever spoke to the affiants\ncannot lead us to assume away Sowell’s burden of proof. Furthermore, counsel’s\nperformance is entitled to “a strong presumption that [it] falls within the wide range of\nreasonable professional assistance.” Strickland, 466 U.S. at 689. Because of this\npresumption, the burden of proof is heavy. See Short v. United States, 471 F.3d 686, 692\n(6th Cir. 2006) (“[D]efendants alleging ineffective assistance of counsel bear ‘a heavy\nburden of proof.’” (quoting Whiting v. Burt, 395 F.3d 602, 617 (6th Cir. 2005))). This\npresumption means nothing if we automatically assume that counsel did not speak to\nvaluable witnesses, absent evidence to the contrary.                          Indeed, that would be a\npresumption that counsel did not perform adequately.\n\n         That is especially the case here where we have no testimony, no affidavits, and\nno records whatsoever from the witnesses best able to speak on the extent of counsel’s\ninvestigation: trial counsel themselves.3 See Carter v. Mitchell, 443 F.3d 517, 531 (6th\nCir. 2006) (“[C]uriously absent from the record is any statement from trial counsel\ndescribing what he did or did not do in investigating [petitioner’s] background. By not\ndetailing trial counsel’s efforts to learn of [petitioner’s] background, [petitioner] has\nprovided no basis for a finding that trial counsel’s investigation was unreasonable.”).\nTrue, that is not always required. See Woodard v. Mitchell, No. 06-4329, 2010 WL\n4924449, at *6 (6th Cir. Dec. 2, 2010). But it is “obvious . . . that [trial counsel’s]\ntestimony, when available, is preferred.” Id. This Court has never held that a petitioner\ncan establish ineffective assistance by omitting all direct evidence of counsel’s\ninvestigation and presenting affidavits from persons who may or may not have been\ncontacted by counsel, setting out their potential testimony that counsel may or may not\n\n\n\n\n         3\n            It is also particularly notable that two of these affiants are willing and able to say that they were\nnever contacted by trial counsel and would have been willing to testify if asked, e.g., Henderson Sowell,\nSr. Aff., some stated only that they would have been willing to testify, e.g., Larry Sowell Aff., and others\nsay nothing at all on the matter, e.g., Catherine Jones Aff. The most logical interpretation of the affidavits\nis that, astoundingly, they each mean what they say and not what they do not say.\n\fNos. 08-3522/3575              Sowell v. Anderson                                   Page 30\n\n\nhave known. To allow that is to do away with both the presumption that counsel\nperformed adequately and the petitioner’s burden of proof.\n\n         The Court’s holding today provides a roadmap to future habeas petitioners\nseeking to show ineffective assistance of counsel due to inadequate mitigation\ninvestigation. First, the petitioner should present no evidence regarding trial counsel’s\ninvestigation. Next, he should submit affidavits from people setting forth any evidence\nthat counsel did not introduce at trial, regardless of whether or not counsel was aware\nof it, regardless of whether or not counsel spoke with the affiants. Lastly, he must make\nsure the affiants do not mention whether or not counsel ever spoke to them during the\nmitigation investigation, or whether or not they were willing to testify at trial. It is that\neasy. Even if counsel did speak with the affiants but chose not to call them as witnesses,\nthe affiants don’t even have to lie about it—they just have to remain silent on the matter.\n\n         I now return to the only two possibly relevant affidavits. Sowell’s aunt, Ann\nSimpson, would not have provided useful testimony. She stated in her affidavit that,\n“Billy Joe was a happy go lucky youth. He was always clean and liked to dress in nice\nclothing.” Also undercutting the image of a chaotic and abusive relationship between\nhis parents, she stated, “Henderson and his wife, Mary Jane, appeared to get along\nokay.”\n\n         This leaves Sowell’s father, Henderson Sowell, Sr., as the only relevant person\nfor whom we have any evidence to say that Sowell’s counsel never contacted him. The\ntestimony the father presents in his affidavit is relatively unremarkable. Most of it\nconcerns Henderson, Sr.’s own life and upbringing. It mentions Henderson’s alcohol\nuse, separation of the family, and the family’s impoverished housing conditions. It does\nnot contain any of the startling and vivid stories from Sowell’s childhood: an infant\nsibling dying of starvation, rats biting the children, the father’s abandonment of the\nchildren, the father’s beating Billy Joe until a neighbor intervened, the father’s sexual\nmolestation of Catherine, and the father’s threatening to burn Catherine to death. Those\nstatements are from either Sowell himself (in his post-sentence interview with Dr.\nHawgood) or his siblings. Even given Henderson, Sr.’s statement that, “In 1983, I was\n\fNos. 08-3522/3575              Sowell v. Anderson                                   Page 31\n\n\nnot contacted by Billy Joe’s attorneys or their assistants,” the testimony he would have\noffered to them was of minimal value.\n\n        Furthermore, assuming that trial counsel had all of the proffered evidence in front\nof him, I cannot say that their decision not to put forth testimony about Sowell’s\nchildhood was not the product of a strategic decision. I agree with the majority that the\ntwo strategies of emphasizing Sowell’s deprived childhood and emphasizing his good\ncharacter in his adult life are not necessarily incompatible. But as the affidavits\nsubmitted by family members make clear, the testimony about his miserable childhood\nwould also include testimony that could harm Sowell’s mitigation case. Each affidavit\nthat included evidence about Sowell’s difficult childhood also mentioned his temper and\nhis violent tendencies. While his difficult childhood would probably paint a more\nsympathetic picture of Sowell, it would also paint a picture of a man inclined towards\nviolence. The mitigation testimony of Sowell’s friends that counsel did present painted\na picture of a kind, generous man, with no mention whatsoever of Sowell’s violent\ntendencies. True, the psychological reports mentioned Sowell’s violent tendencies. But\nit could certainly have been a strategic decision by counsel to have friends give positive\ntestimony about Sowell’s character, while reserving any analysis of his violent\ntendencies to the expert witnesses. This would emphasize that his violent outburst that\nresulted in these crimes, while predictable to the experts in psychology and psychiatry,\nwas surprising and out of character to those who knew Sowell best. Pursuing an\nadditional strategy that focused on his difficult upbringing would not be inconsistent, but\nin this case it would be at great cost because it would bring to light his violent tendencies\neven more.\n\n        The majority dismisses this concern by employing a double standard. The\nmajority minimizes the damaging effect of the testimony about Sowell’s violent\ntendencies by assuring itself that the psychological reports available to the court at\nsentencing already “thoroughly documented Sowell’s short temper and his propensity\nfor responding violently to perceived injustices, especially when drinking.” Similarly,\n\fNos. 08-3522/3575                    Sowell v. Anderson                                              Page 32\n\n\nthe psychological reports briefly documented Sowell’s difficult upbringing.4 Of course,\non these matters, the majority states that testimony from family members would be far\nmore vivid and effective at describing Sowell’s difficult childhood: “These specifics had\nfar more evidentiary power than the abstractions and oblique references contained in the\nexperts’ written reports.” Why would specifics about his violent tendencies not also\nhave “more evidentiary power”? Apparently, the advantage of specific first-hand\ntestimony over psychological reports only works in Sowell’s favor and never against it.\n\n         I dissent from the majority opinion’s affirmance of the district court’s grant of\nrelief because a careful examination of the evidence before us reveals that Sowell cannot\nshow either that his counsel undertook an inadequate investigation or that counsel’s\nchoice of mitigation strategy was unreasonable. The majority can only find grounds for\nrelief by failing to examine the affidavits individually, presuming them all to be\nunequivocally relevant and helpful to Sowell, and presuming that trial counsel did not\nperform an adequate investigation.

BATCHELDER, C.J. (pp. 801-05), delivered a separate opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>OPINION</h2>\n<p>ROGERS, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>Billy Joe Sowell was convicted of aggravated murder and sentenced to death by a three-judge panel in 1983. At sentencing, counsel's mitigation strategy was to portray Sowell as a good person who lost his temper under the influence of drugs and alcohol. Counsel pursued this strategy despite having available the reports of several court-appointed mental health experts, which hinted at Sowell's difficult upbringing but did not provide specific details about his severely impoverished and abusive childhood. Despite these reports, counsel did not conduct an investigation into Sowell's background or interview any of his family members. Had they done so, there is a reasonable probability that the additional mitigating evidence would have led at least one of the panel judges to vote against the death penalty. The district court therefore properly granted habeas relief on this basis.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>The facts underlying Sowell's conviction are not in dispute. As we did in our initial review of Sowell's petition, we rely on the Ohio Court of Appeals' version of the facts:</p>\n<blockquote>The record discloses that [Sowell] and [Calvert] Graham resided in adjacent apartments on the third floor of an apartment building in downtown Cincinnati. [Sowell] was the resident manager of the building and became acquainted with Graham, who performed occasional odd jobs at the apartment building. After Graham became a resident in [Sowell's] apartment building, the two men developed a friendly relationship and visited one another in their respective residences.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>On May 1, 1983, three days prior to the instant offenses, [Sowell] was a guest in Graham's apartment. Also present were Donna Edwards (Edwards), a woman with whom Graham shared the apartment, and [Pam] Billups [a former prostitute who had been visiting Graham and Edwards]. Graham offered two marijuana cigarettes to [Sowell], which he accepted. Thereafter [Sowell] left the apartment in the company of Billups and proceeded to a nearby restaurant where he purchased dinner for her. En route to the restaurant, [Sowell] smoked the second marijuana cigarette, having consumed the first at <span class=\"star-pagination\">*787</span> Graham's residence. Thereafter the pair made their way to a hotel where [Sowell] rented a room. There was conflicting testimony concerning the events that transpired thereafter. However, it is not disputed that [Sowell] eventually lost consciousness, having consumed an unspecified quantity of wine during the evening in addition to the marijuana. The next morning [Sowell] made his way back to his residence, stopping along his route to obtain breakfast for Billups.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>[Sowell] next encountered Billups on the afternoon of May 4, 1983. Billups was in the company of Edwards and the trio passed in the doorway of a store but did not acknowledge one another. As will be seen, this seemingly inconsequential meeting gained significance later in the day.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>That evening [Sowell] returned to his apartment building after, according to his testimony, visiting no less than five taverns and consuming at least one double shot of vodka at each stop. Upon returning to his apartment building [Sowell] realized that he was not in the mood to retire for the evening, and instead presented himself at Graham's apartment. Graham greeted [Sowell] and invited him inside, where Edwards and Billups were also present. Graham produced a marijuana cigarette which was consumed by all four occupants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>[Sowell] testified before the trial court that following the consumption of the marijuana, he fell asleep for a short time. When he awoke the others were still present and [Sowell] discovered that approximately $190 had been removed from his trouser pocket. At first [Sowell] thought that the trio was playing a joke upon him; however, his requests for the return of his money received no response. [Sowell] further testified that Graham then picked up a knife and ordered [Sowell] to leave the residence. [Sowell] complied and departed, but he was extremely angry as a result of his loss.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Both Billups and Edwards told the trial court that [Sowell's] visit to the apartment on the day in question was at first friendly. However, [Sowell] soon became agitated and accused Billups of being unsociable in that she did not speak to him earlier that afternoon. [Sowell] also accused Billups of stealing $24 from him during their encounter three days earlier. When [Sowell] referred to Billups in terms meant to insult her pedigree, Graham ordered [Sowell] to leave the premises. [Sowell] left, stating that he was going to obtain his gun, return and shoot Billups.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>[Sowell] went directly to his apartment where he directed his common-law wife, Lenora Waugh (Waugh), to bring his gun to him. Waugh complied with that request, as well as with [Sowell's] instructions to accompany him to Graham's apartment. Upon returning to Graham's door, Waugh, at [Sowell's] instruction, knocked and indicated to those inside that she was a woman named Portia. Graham responded to the door and opened it. Edwards and Billups testified, and the trial court found, that [Sowell] forced his way into the apartment, firing a bullet from his handgun into the ceiling as he entered. [Sowell] demanded to know Billups's whereabouts and threatened to shoot her. Graham was able to calm [Sowell] and began to escort him from the apartment and to close the door, whereupon [Sowell] suddenly turned and shot Graham in the abdomen. As Graham fell, [Sowell] fired a second shot into Graham's skull. Graham fell to the floor, mortally wounded.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>[Sowell] next made his way to the closet in which Billups was cowering, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*788</span> and fired three bullets into her body. [Sowell] next placed the gun to Billups's forehead and pulled the trigger. However, the gun did not expel a bullet because it no longer contained ammunition. [Sowell] left the apartment after warning Edwards not to leave the premises or he would shoot her also. [Sowell] returned to his apartment, obtained money and made his way to a nearby tavern where he was apprehended by the police.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>[Sowell] testified regarding the shootings and told the court that he returned to Graham's apartment to demand his money and that he was confronted by Graham, who was armed with a knife. [Sowell] stated that it was only after Graham made a furtive movement that [Sowell] began shooting at Graham, and that one of the bullets struck the ceiling. [Sowell] explained his conduct as follows: \"It just, I just clocked out. When I seen that person going this way I just pivoted, I pivoted on my gun, I was shooting, I was angry, I started shooting, I just started shooting everybody I seen.\"</blockquote>\n<p><i>State v. Sowell,</i> No. C-830835, 1986 WL 9082, at *1-2 (Ohio Ct.App. Aug. 20, 1986) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p>Sowell was indicted on one count of aggravated murder for the shooting of Graham, and one count of attempted murder for the shooting of Billups. The aggravated murder count contained a capital specification alleging that the shooting was part of a course of conduct involving the purposeful killing of or attempt to kill two or more persons. <i>See</i> O.R.C. § 2929.04(a)(5). Relying on the advice of trial counsel, Sowell waived his right to a jury trial and opted for trial by a three-judge panel, <i>see</i> O.R.C. § 2945.06, which unanimously found Sowell guilty of both counts, including the capital specification.</p>\n<p>The defense's mitigating evidence consisted of an unsworn statement by Sowell, the testimony of five witnesses who knew Sowell as an adult, and the submission of several psychological reports prepared by court-appointed mental health experts. Also before the panel was the presentence investigation (PSI) report prepared by the probation department. None of this material revealed any substantial details about Sowell's background or family history. The panel unanimously sentenced Sowell to death on the aggravated murder count, and to a term of seven to twenty-five years of imprisonment on the attempted murder count. Sowell's conviction and sentence were upheld on direct appeal and his petition for state post-conviction relief was unsuccessful at trial and on appeal.</p>\n<p>Sowell's federal habeas petition was initially dismissed without prejudice for failure to exhaust the Ohio Supreme Court's <i>Murnahan</i> procedure for raising claims of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel. <i>See </i><i>State v. Murnahan,</i> 63 Ohio St.3d 60, 584 N.E.2d 1204, 1209 (1992). After the Ohio courts denied his <i>Murnahan</i> motions, Sowell renewed his federal habeas petition on May 24, 1994, raising fifty-two claims. The district court conducted an evidentiary hearing allowing Sowell to develop one of these claimsthat his waiver of a jury trial was not knowing and intelligent. Our initial review of Sowell's petition reversed the district court's conditional grant of habeas relief on that claim. <i>Sowell v. Bradshaw,</i> 372 F.3d 821, 838 (6th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p>The district court reopened Sowell's petition on November 16, 2004, and addressed his remaining claims. In a carefully reasoned opinion, the district court found that Sowell received ineffective assistance of counsel during the penalty phase of his trial. <i>Sowell v. Collins,</i> 557 F.Supp.2d 843 (S.D.Ohio 2008). After reviewing the mitigating evidence presented <span class=\"star-pagination\">*789</span> to the three-judge panel, the court compared this with the additional mitigating evidence that was submitted in Sowell's state post-conviction petition. The court noted that \"virtually all of the evidence presented [at sentencing] concerned good deeds performed by petitioner during his adult life.\" <i>Id.</i> at 852. In contrast, the court noted, the additional mitigating information concerned evidence that \"petitioner grew up in extreme poverty and suffered severe abuse and neglect as a child.\" <i>Id.</i> at 852-53.</p>\n<p>The district court found that counsel's failure to discover this entirely different category of mitigating evidence was constitutionally deficient performance. <i>Id.</i> at 866-71 (citing <i>Strickland v. Washington,</i> 466 U.S. 668, 690, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984)). Counsel did not perform an adequate sentencing-phase investigation, the court reasoned, because they \"fail[ed] to interview members of petitioner's family\" and \"ignored known leads that might have helped them to prepare their case in mitigation.\" <i>Id.</i> at 870-71. The district court found that Sowell was prejudiced by his attorneys' performance because \"a reasonable probability exists that the outcome would have been different had more detailed information been presented regarding petitioner's tragic childhood and social development.\" <i>Id.</i> at 871. The court rejected the argument that this evidence was \"merely cumulative of information that was presented\" in the written reports of the court-appointed experts, because the new information was \"significant,\" \"qualitatively different,\" and \"would have painted an entirely different portrait\" of Sowell. <i>Id.</i> at 872. The court granted a conditional writ on Sowell's ineffective-assistance claim and denied relief on all of the remaining grounds.</p>\n<p>The Government appeals the district court's conditional grant of habeas relief on the ineffective-assistance claim. Sowell cross-appeals, challenging the district court's dismissal of five of his claims: (1) ineffective assistance of counsel during the trial's guilt phase; (2) violation of Sowell's due process rights based on an ex parte meeting between the presiding judge and members of the probation department; (3) certain alleged sentencing errors; (4) insufficient evidence to support his convictions; and (5) suppression of exculpatory evidence by the prosecution. For substantially the reasons set out by the district court, the grant of a conditional writ on the claim that counsel were ineffective during the penalty-phase proceeding was proper, and Sowell's remaining grounds for habeas relief are without merit.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>This case is not governed by the strict limits on federal habeas review imposed by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA). Because Sowell filed his habeas petition in 1994, the pre-AEDPA standard of review applies. <i>Sowell,</i> 372 F.3d at 828. Under this standard, a state court's factual findings are entitled to a presumption of correctness that is rebuttable by convincing evidence, <i>McQueen v. Scroggy,</i> 99 F.3d 1302, 1310 (6th Cir.1996), while the state court's determination of questions of federal law or mixed questions of federal law and fact are reviewed de novo, <i>Coleman v. Mitchell,</i> 244 F.3d 533, 538 (6th Cir.2001). The pre-AEDPA standard of review \"entitle[s] [Sowell] to have the federal habeas court make its own independent determination of his federal claim, without being bound by the determination on the merits of that claim reached in the state proceedings.\" <i>Wainwright v. Sykes,</i> 433 U.S. 72, 87, 97 S.Ct. 2497, 53 L.Ed.2d 594 (1977).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*790</span> <i>A. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel During the Penalty Phase</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Application of this standard leads to the conclusion that Sowell received ineffective assistance during the penalty phase of his capital trial. Trial counsel failed to uncover and present evidence of Sowell's deprived and abusive childhood, which left the sentencing panel unaware of a substantial body of mitigating evidence that could have led at least one of the judges to vote against the death penalty. Because we uphold the district court's determination that counsel's failure to conduct an adequate sentencing-phase investigation fell short of constitutional standards, it is not necessary to address Sowell's other arguments that his counsel's performance during the penalty phase was deficient.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Deficient performance</h2>\n<p>Sowell's attorneys performed deficiently because they did not interview Sowell's family members or investigate references to his horrific childhood contained in the reports of court-appointed mental health experts. Counsel's failure to interview Sowell's family was inconsistent with their obligation to conduct a thorough sentencing-phase investigation, <i>see </i><i>Porter v. McCollum,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 130 S.Ct. 447, 453, 175 L.Ed.2d 398 (2009) (per curiam), and was unreasonable in light of the \"leads\" contained in the experts' reports, which should have prompted counsel to investigate further, <i>see </i><i>Wiggins v. Smith,</i> 539 U.S. 510, 534, 123 S.Ct. 2527, 156 L.Ed.2d 471 (2003). Because they were not aware of this additional mitigating evidence, Sowell's attorneys were not in a position to make a conscious, strategic decision about the type of mitigation case to present at sentencing.</p>\n<p>Counsel's mitigation strategy at sentencing was to present Sowell as a good person who lost his temper because he felt betrayed by his friend Graham. The mitigation evidence consisted of Sowell's unsworn statement, the testimony of five witnessesLenora Waugh, two probation officers, and two work colleagueswho knew Sowell as an adult, and the submission of several competency and capacity evaluations. As the district court noted, almost all of the testimony involved good deeds Sowell had done as an adult. <i>Sowell,</i> 557 F.Supp.2d at 852. The witnesses gave specific examples of times when Sowell had helped them in need and had attempted to prevent crimes in his community. They testified that Sowell was kind-hearted, trustworthy, a hard worker, and a good father. The psychological reports likewise described Sowell as \"a most righteous man with a high moral sense\" who was \"proud of his good works.\" But their discussion of Sowell's background was perfunctory, and none of the witnesses shed any light on Sowell's childhood or family history. Direct examination of the six witnesses totaled only thirty-four pages of transcript. Counsel failed to call any family members to testify, and the panel did not learn anything substantial about Sowell's formative years.</p>\n<p>There is nothing wrong with a mitigation strategy that emphasizes a capital defendant's redeeming qualities. But Sowell's attorneys did not make a conscious choice among available alternative strategies because they overlooked an entire category of compelling mitigating evidenceevidence that might have caused the sentencing panel to rethink its assessment of Sowell's moral culpability. Counsel's failure to present evidence of Sowell's horrific childhood resulted from their ignorance of this evidence, not from an informed choice between mutually exclusive mitigation theories. Sowell's attorneys failed to uncover this additional mitigating <span class=\"star-pagination\">*791</span> evidenceand therefore performed deficientlyfor two reasons.</p>\n<p>First, counsel did not interview any of Sowell's family members, including his father, brothers, sisters, and other relatives. Affidavits of fourteen family members and friends accompanied Sowell's state post-conviction petition, recounting the violence and privation of Sowell's childhood. Many of these witnesses stated that they would have been available and willing to testify at the penalty phase but had not been asked to do so. Sowell's attorneys did not contact a single member of his immediate family, and only Sowell's father spoke with the social worker who compiled information for the psychological evaluations.</p>\n<p>Counsel's failure to interview Sowell's family fell short of the \"reasonable\" investigation required by the Sixth Amendment, as well as the then-prevailing standards \"articulated by the American Bar Association (ABA)standards to which we long have referred as `guides to determining what is reasonable.'\" <i>Wiggins,</i> 539 U.S. at 524, 123 S.Ct. 2527 (quoting <i>Strickland,</i> 466 U.S. at 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052). As in <i>Porter,</i> \"[i]t is unquestioned that under the prevailing professional norms at the time of [defendant's] trial, counsel had an `obligation to conduct a thorough investigation of the defendant's background.'\" 130 S.Ct. at 452 (quoting <i>Williams v. Taylor,</i> 529 U.S. 362, 396, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000)). These standards required counsel to make efforts to \"`explore all avenues leading to facts relevant to . . . the penalty in the event of conviction,'\" including evidence of Sowell's \"`background, education, . . . family relationships, and the like.'\" <i>Bobby v. Van Hook,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 130 S.Ct. 13, 17, 175 L.Ed.2d 255 (2009) (quoting 1 ABA Standards for Criminal Justice 4-4.1, at 4-53 (2d ed. 1980)). In choosing not to interview Sowell's family members, his attorneys failed in their obligation to conduct a \"thorough\" investigation.</p>\n<p>Of course, these professional standards did not require Sowell's attorneys to contact every person who ever knew Sowell during every period of his life, and \"there comes a point at which evidence from more distant relatives can reasonably be expected to be only cumulative, and the search for it distractive from more important duties.\" <i>Van Hook,</i> 130 S.Ct. at 19 (2009). But Sowell's attorneys stopped well short of that point. While there is a \"strong presumption that counsel's conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance,\" <i>Strickland,</i> 466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052, \"strategic choices made after less than complete investigation are reasonable precisely to the extent that reasonable professional judgments support the limitations on investigation,\" <i>Wiggins,</i> 539 U.S. at 528, 123 S.Ct. 2527 (quoting <i>Strickland,</i> 466 U.S. at 690-91, 104 S.Ct. 2052). An attorney does not make a strategic decision by choosing to ignore a body of evidence, the contents of which are unknown. That is not strategy.</p>\n<p>Because counsel did not interview Sowell's family members, the panel did not learn that Sowell's early life was abusive, impoverished, and totally chaotic. The affidavits of Sowell's father, brothers, sisters, and family friends describe in vivid detail the physical and psychological abuse Sowell endured as a child. Sowell's father was a serious alcoholic who beat his wife and children on a regular basis. His father was frequently absent for long periods of time, but when he was home, the family lived in terror. To avoid setting off a drunken outburst, Sowell and his siblings would not speak while their father was home. Sowell's mother was only 15 years old when she got married. She lacked basic parenting skills and vocally wished her children were dead or had never been <span class=\"star-pagination\">*792</span> born. She was petrified of Sowell's father and would not defend the children from his drunken beatings. To escape the domestic violence, she often fled the home, leaving the children without supervision for days at a time. Sowell's parents eventually divorced, but Sowell and his siblings remained with their father. The abuse continued into Sowell's adolescent years. On one occasion, Sowell's father tied him and his sister JoAnn to a chair and beat them until a neighbor intervened. Sowell's father also sexually molested Sowell's sister Catherine and threatened to pour gasoline over her and watch her burn if she reported it.</p>\n<p>The affidavits also paint a picture of extreme poverty. The panel did not learn, for example, that Sowell's infant brother died of starvation and that Sowell and his siblings had to beg for and steal food. The children were bitten by rats, infected with worms, and lacked sufficient clothing and shoes. The entire familyall six childrenlived in a small trailer and later moved into an unfinished basement that lacked electricity or running water. By the time Sowell was fourteen, he was living in a junkyard, on his own, in a tent. None of Sowell's siblings has fared any better in life. JoAnn became a prostitute and killed her pimp. She died a week before the murder in this case. Larry Sowell shot his brother Benny and served time for manslaughter. Benny and Henderson Sowell, Jr. were both incarcerated for burglary. Four of the five children who survived were alcohol or drug addicts. \"[A] competent attorney, aware of this history, would have introduced it at sentencing,\" <i>Wiggins,</i> 539 U.S. at 535, 123 S.Ct. 2527, and counsel's failure to do so here was deficient.</p>\n<p>Second, counsel failed to uncover compelling evidence of Sowell's background because they did not follow up on the obvious leads contained in the written reports of court-appointed experts. \"In assessing the reasonableness of an attorney's investigation, . . . a court must consider not only the quantum of evidence already known to counsel, but also whether the known evidence would lead a reasonable attorney to investigate further.\" <i>Wiggins,</i> 539 U.S. at 527, 123 S.Ct. 2527. The question is \"whether counsel adequately followed up on the `leads' that were available to them,\" <i>Haliym v. Mitchell,</i> 492 F.3d 680, 712 (6th Cir.2007), or whether counsel instead \"abandon[ed] their investigation at an unreasonable juncture,\" <i>Wiggins,</i> 539 U.S. at 527, 123 S.Ct. 2527. Our decision in <i>Harries v. Bell,</i> 417 F.3d 631 (6th Cir.2005), illustrates the point. In that case, we held that interviews conducted by counsel \"produced viable leads regarding Harries's poor mental health and troubled family background,\" and held that \"[c]ounsel's failure to follow these promising leads . . . was deficient.\" <i>Id.</i> at 639.</p>\n<p>Here, the psychological reports would have prompted a reasonable attorney to expand the investigation beyond the redeeming aspects of Sowell's adult life. The district court summarized the indications of Sowell's troubled childhood in these reports as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>Dr. [Nancy] Schmidtgoessling's mitigation report noted that petitioner had a \"rough childhood\" and \"an unhappy home life.\" She reported that petitioner experienced a \"lack of adequate food, clothing and material goods as well as [a] lack of close parental nurturance.\" According to her report, petitioner felt \"abandoned, angry, without significant stable relationships, and conscious of the need to defend himself in a dangerous, hostile environment.\" She relayed that petitioner was \"on his own\" at a young age, that he skipped school, and that he ran away for days at a time. Dr. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*793</span> Schmidtgoessling noted petitioner's history of depression and alcohol abuse. Likewise, Dr. [James] Titchener reported that petitioner's mother was distant, that she frequently left her family, and that her abandonment was responsible for much of the anger and hostility petitioner experienced. Dr. [William] Walters noted that petitioner's father was a \"strict disciplinarian\" and that the Sowell family was very poor. Walters, Schmidtgoessling, Titchener and [Dr. Emmett] Cooper all noted that alcohol and marijuana use contributed to that events leading up to the murder.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Sowell,</i> 557 F.Supp.2d at 869. These hints of a childhood filled with privation and abuse should have moved Sowell's attorneys to expand the scope of their investigation. Instead, Sowell's attorneys \"ignored pertinent avenues for investigation of which [they] should have been aware.\" <i>Porter,</i> 130 S.Ct. at 453.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court's decision in <i>Wiggins</i> strongly supports the district court's conclusion that counsel performed deficiently in failing to follow up on these leads. In <i>Wiggins,</i> counsel abandoned their investigation of Wiggins' background \"after having acquired only rudimentary knowledge of his history from a narrow set of sources.\" 539 U.S. at 524, 123 S.Ct. 2527. The PSI report and Department of Social Services (DSS) records that counsel obtained revealed that Wiggins' mother was a chronic alcoholic; that Wiggins was \"shuttled from foster home to foster home and displayed some emotional difficulties\" while there; that he had \"frequent, lengthy absences\" from school; and that, \"on at least one occasion, his mother left him and his siblings alone for days without food.\" <i>Id.</i> at 525, 123 S.Ct. 2527. Despite these promising leads, counsel did not investigate further. The Supreme Court held that \"any reasonably competent attorney would have realized that pursuing these leads was necessary to making an informed choice among possible defenses.\" <i>Id.</i> at 525, 123 S.Ct. 2527. \"Counsel's decision not to expand their investigation beyond the PSI and DSS records\" was \"unreasonable in light of what counsel actually discovered in the DSS records.\" <i>Id.</i> at 524, 123 S.Ct. 2527.</p>\n<p>More recently in <i>Porter,</i> 130 S.Ct. at 453, the Supreme Court held that counsel's failure to interview the defendant's family members and obtain school, medical, or military service records was constitutionally deficient. <i>Id.</i> Like the counsel in <i>Wiggins,</i> Porter's attorney did not follow up on leads contained in court-ordered competency evaluations, which \"collectively reported Porter's very few years of regular school, his military service and wounds sustained in combat, and his father's `over-discipline[e].'\" <i>Id.</i> This court has also recently found deficient performance where defense counsel did not follow up on leads developed from a narrow set of sources. <i>Goodwin v. Johnson,</i> 632 F.3d 301 (6th Cir.2011). In that case, defense counsel interviewed some of Goodwin's family members, but did not contact his mother, sister, neighbors and friends, or the mother of Goodwin's child. We held that \"[t]he information Goodwin's counsel possessed, obviously incomplete, should have triggered a more thorough investigation of Goodwin's past.\" <i>Id.</i> at 324.</p>\n<p>As the district court recognized, \"[t]his is not a case where counsel presented absolutely no evidence in mitigation.\" <i>Sowell,</i> 557 F.Supp.2d at 871. The evidence counsel did present was intended to draw out the redeeming qualities that made Sowell's life worth sparing. But counsel's decision to emphasize Sowell's worthwhile adult life while leaving out his horrific childhood is not easily considered a reasonable mitigation strategy, particularly <span class=\"star-pagination\">*794</span> where the additional evidence would not have been inconsistent withand might even have strengthenedthe mitigation case counsel did present. \"The evidence concerning petitioner's horrific upbringing that counsel failed to present would have bolstered their mitigation case by demonstrating that petitioner was capable of generosity and good acts in spite of the upbringing that he endured.\" <i>Id.</i> at 872. This case is therefore different from <i>Sears v. Upton,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 130 S.Ct. 3259, 3261-62, 177 L.Ed.2d 1025 (2010) (per curiam), where counsel's mitigation strategy of emphasizing Sears' \"stable, loving,\" and \"privileged\" childhood backfired when the prosecutor used this evidence to argue that Sears was even more culpable than he would have been had he grown up as a \"deprived child from the inner city . . . who[m] society ha[d] turned its back on at an early age.\"</p>\n<p>More importantly, even if a decision to \"emphasize the good rather than the bad\" were a reasonable mitigation strategy in the abstract, <i>Sowell,</i> 557 F.Supp.2d at 871, it was not reasonable in this case because counsel were not fully aware of their options. The Supreme Court has found deficient performance even in \"cases in which counsel presented what could be described as a superficially reasonable mitigation theory during the penalty phase.\" <i>Sears,</i> 130 S.Ct. at 3266. Thus, notwithstanding the mitigation case counsel did present, our \"principal concern in deciding whether counsel exercised reasonable professional judgment is whether the investigation supporting counsel's decision not to introduce mitigation evidence of [defendant's] background <i>was itself reasonable.</i>\" <i>Wiggins,</i> 539 U.S. at 523, 123 S.Ct. 2527 (emphasis in original). In this case, as in <i>Wiggins,</i> \"counsel were not in a position to make a reasonable strategic choice . . . because the investigation supporting their choice was unreasonable.\" <i>Id.</i> at 536, 123 S.Ct. 2527.</p>\n<p>As the district court explained, this is also not a case where counsel could have legitimately feared that digging deeper into Sowell's past would turn up evidence that was more damaging than favorable. <i>Sowell,</i> 557 F.Supp.2d at 873. Sowell's entire criminal record and arrest history were included in the PSI report and the mental health evaluations that were submitted to the panel at sentencing. The psychological reports also thoroughly documented Sowell's short temper and his propensity for responding violently to perceived injustices, especially when drinking. Thus, the panel already knew the worst. Further investigation could only have helped Sowell. This case therefore differs from <i>Wood v. Allen,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 130 S.Ct. 841, 847-49, 175 L.Ed.2d 738 (2010), where counsel had made a strategic decision not to investigte Wood's mental deficiencies, despite having available a favorable expert report on the matter, because the report also contained details about Wood's 19 earlier arrests and his attempt to murder a prior ex-girlfriendrebuttal evidence that counsel had been successful in excluding at trial. <i>Id.</i> at 850 n. 3, 130 S.Ct. 841. Sowell's case is also different from <i>Burger v. Kemp,</i> 483 U.S. 776, 794, 107 S.Ct. 3114, 97 L.Ed.2d 638 (1987), in which a limited investigation was reasonable because all potential witnesses interviewed by counsel provided information that was more harmful than helpful. Without knowledge of the mitigating side of Sowell's background, his attorneys could not have made a conscious, strategic judgment that this evidence would do more harm than good.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Prejudice</h2>\n<p>Turning to the second prong of <i>Strickland,</i> Sowell was prejudiced by his <span class=\"star-pagination\">*795</span> attorneys' performance because, as the district court found, \"there is a reasonable likelihood that at least one member of the three-judge panel would have voted in favor of a sentence less than death if the panel had been informed of Sowell's dysfunctional childhood.\" <i>Sowell,</i> 557 F.Supp.2d at 866. The additional mitigating evidence differs in strength and in subject matter from the evidence the panel heard, and the evidence is therefore not cumulative. And far from being inconsistent with counsel's mitigation strategy, the information concerning Sowell's background would have strengthened counsel's mitigation theory that Sowell was a good person because it was highly relevant to any assessment of his moral worth.</p>\n<p>To establish prejudice, Sowell must demonstrate that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. <i>See </i><i>Strickland,</i> 466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052. \"In assessing prejudice, we reweigh the evidence in aggravation against the totality of available mitigating evidence.\" <i>Wiggins,</i> 539 U.S. at 534, 123 S.Ct. 2527. Thus, in a capital case, \"the question is whether there is a reasonable probability that, absent the errors, the sentencerincluding an appellate court, to the extent it independently reweighs the evidencewould have concluded that the balance of aggravating and mitigating circumstances did not warrant death.\" <i>Strickland,</i> 466 U.S. at 695, 104 S.Ct. 2052. Additional mitigating evidence that is \"merely cumulative\" of that already presented does not undermine the results of sentencing. <i>Broom v. Mitchell,</i> 441 F.3d 392, 410 (6th Cir.2006). Instead, \"the new evidence . . . must differ in a substantial wayin strength and subject matterfrom the evidence actually presented at sentencing.\" <i>Tibbetts v. Bradshaw,</i> 633 F.3d 436, 444 (6th Cir.2011) (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p>Here, the additional mitigating evidence is sufficient to \"undermine confidence in the outcome\" of Sowell's sentencing proceeding. <i>See </i><i>Strickland,</i> 466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052. As in <i>Williams,</i> 529 U.S. at 398, 120 S.Ct. 1495, \"the graphic description of [defendant's] childhood, filled with abuse and privation, . . . might well have influenced the [panel's] appraisal of his moral culpability.\" Though the mitigating evidence regarding Sowell's childhood is extensive, the panel heard only about Sowell's adult life. The testimony at sentencing supports counsel's theory that Sowell's life had residual value. But what is key to the prejudice inquiry is the evidence the panel did <i>not</i> hearspecific details about Sowell's \"nightmarish\" childhood. <i>See id.</i> at 395, 120 S.Ct. 1495.</p>\n<p>This evidence is not merely cumulative. There is no question that the additional mitigating evidence is stronger than anything the panel learned about Sowell's background from the written reports of Drs. Schmidtgoessling, Titchener, and Walters. These reports spoke in generalities that lacked any details of the severe abuse and abject poverty Sowell experienced as a child, or any \"graphic descriptions\" of the atmosphere of violence that permeated his formative years. <i>See id.</i> at 398, 120 S.Ct. 1495. In contrast, Sowell's family members offered first-hand, eyewitness accounts of specific examples of extreme poverty and abuse. These specifics had far more evidentiary power than the abstractions and oblique references contained in the experts' written reports.</p>\n<p>What is more, the experts themselves never heard any of these details when they conducted their evaluations. Drs. Schmidtgoessling, Titchener, and Cooper interviewed only Sowell and had no contact with his family members. Only the social <span class=\"star-pagination\">*796</span> worker who compiled information for Dr. Walters' pretrial examination had any contact with Sowell's family, and she spoke only with Sowell's fathera source who had good reason to withhold the most compelling examples of abuse Sowell and his siblings endured as children. The reports of Drs. Titchener and Walters were not prepared for mitigation purposes, and there is nothing in Dr. Cooper's report about Sowell's background. These experts were appointed to evaluate Sowell's competence to stand trial and his mental capacity for purposes of exploring an insanity defense, and to the extent their reports discuss Sowell's background at all, they are drawn from an even narrower set of sources than those available to defense counsel.</p>\n<p>The subject matter of the additional mitigating evidence is different as well. The good deeds Sowell had done as an adult provide an incomplete picture of his moral worth. Sowell's actions as an adultgood and badare merely a snapshot in time, unilluminated by the longitudinal perspective that his developmental history provides. \"[E]vidence about the defendant's background and character is relevant because of the belief, long held by this society, that defendants who commit criminal acts that are attributable to a disadvantaged background . . . may be less culpable.\" <i>Penry v. Lynaugh,</i> 492 U.S. 302, 319, 109 S.Ct. 2934, 106 L.Ed.2d 256 (1989) (internal quotations omitted). Moreover, Sowell's good deeds might have been written off as isolated incidents or attributed to ulterior motives by a sentencing judge disinclined to see Sowell as a basically good person. But the additional mitigating evidence is of more than a few scattered incidents. It is evidence of a lifetime of privation and abuse, beginning in early childhood and continuing throughout the formative years of Sowell's life.</p>\n<p>The evidence the panel did not hearspecific details about Sowell's horrific childhoodis often the kind of evidence that undermines a court's confidence in the outcome of a capital sentencing proceeding. In <i>Williams,</i> 529 U.S. at 395, 120 S.Ct. 1495, the Supreme Court found prejudice where counsel failed to present evidence that Williams had a \"nightmarish\" childhood, that his \"parents were imprisoned for the criminal neglect\" of their children, and that Williams \"had been severely and repeatedly beaten by his father.\" Similarly in <i>Wiggins,</i> 539 U.S. at 535, 123 S.Ct. 2527, the Court found prejudice where counsel failed to discover \"powerful\" evidence of \"severe privation and abuse in the first six years of [Wiggins'] life while in the custody of his alcoholic, absentee mother,\" as well as evidence of \"physical torment, sexual molestation, and repeated rape during his subsequent years in foster care.\" Again in <i>Rompilla v. Beard,</i> 545 U.S. 374, 392-93, 125 S.Ct. 2456, 162 L.Ed.2d 360 (2005), the Court found prejudice where counsel failed to present evidence that Rompilla was reared in abject poverty and suffered extreme physical and psychological abuse, which included being \"locked . . . [with] his brother Richard in a small wire mesh dog pen that was filthy and excrement filled.\" And in <i>Porter,</i> 130 S.Ct. at 449, the Court found prejudicial counsel's failure to present evidence of Porter's \"abusive childhood\" and \"horrible family life,\" including an incident in which \"Porter's father shot at him for coming home late, but missed and just beat Porter instead,\" and another in which Porter's mother was beaten \"so severely that she had to go to the hospital and lost a child.\" Most recently in <i>Sears,</i> 130 S.Ct. at 3262, the Court found prejudicial counsel's failure to present evidence that Sears' home life was \"physically abusive\" and that he \"suffered sexual abuse at the hands of an adolescent male cousin.\"</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*797</span> A finding that Sowell was prejudiced by his attorneys' failure to develop and present exactly this kind of mitigating evidence is therefore squarely in line with the Supreme Court decisions addressing ineffective assistance during the penalty phase of a capital trial. Our court has also repeatedly found that ignorance of specifics about a defendant's formative years undermines confidence in the outcome of a capital sentencing proceeding. Most recently in <i>Goodwin,</i> 632 F.3d at 329, we deemed prejudicial counsel's failure to present evidence that Goodwin suffered \"severe privation and abuse in the early years of his life and while in the custody of his alcoholic and drug using mother,\" including evidence that he was \"frequently beaten, sexually molested, and abandoned by both of his parents.\" Likewise in <i>Mason v. Mitchell,</i> 543 F.3d 766, 780 (6th Cir.2008), this court held that the petitioner was prejudiced where counsel did not present evidence of Mason's \"abusive and unhealthy\" childhood, including evidence that his parents were \"daily drug users as well as traffickers,\" that his mother \"shot at his father because of his involvement with prostitution,\" and that Mason's parents \"regularly abused Mason and isolated all of their children from anyone not associated with the parents' drug dealing activities.\" And in <i>Harries,</i> 417 F.3d at 639, we upheld the district court's finding of prejudice where counsel failed to discover evidence that Harries suffered \"significant physical abuse\" during his \"traumatic\" childhood, including an incident in which he was \"hit . . . on the head with a frying pan,\" and another in which he was \"choked so severely that his eyes hemorrhaged.\"</p>\n<p>In short, like the additional mitigating evidence presented in these cases, evidence of Sowell's severely impoverished and abusive childhood is not merely cumulative of that presented at sentencing. This is also not a case in which the omitted evidence \"would have triggered admission of . . . powerful [aggravating] evidence in rebuttal.\" <i>Wong v. Belmontes,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 130 S.Ct. 383, 387-88, 175 L.Ed.2d 328 (2009) (per curiam). In <i>Belmontes,</i> defense counsel \"built his mitigation strategy around the overriding need to exclude\" evidence that Belmontes had committed a prior murder. <i>Id.</i> at 385. The Supreme Court held that counsel's decision not to use expert testimony to \"humanize\" Belmontes was not prejudicial, because the expert testimony would have opened the door to evidence of the prior murder kept out only by counsel's vigilance. <i>Id.</i> at 388; <i>see also </i><i>Wood,</i> 130 S.Ct. at 850 n. 3. Here, the panel already knew the most damaging information about Sowell's background from the PSI and psychological reports, and additional mitigating evidence could only have tipped the balance in favor of leniency.</p>\n<p>We recognize that the prejudice question in this case is close, and that the Ohio courts had a different view of the impact defense counsel's performance had on Sowell's sentencing proceeding. However, under the pre-AEDPA standard that applies to this case, the federal courts must make their \"own independent determination of [Sowell's] federal claim,\" and are not bound by the state courts' view. <i>Wainwright,</i> 433 U.S. at 87, 97 S.Ct. 2497. For these reasons, the district court properly found that there is a reasonable probability that a three-judge panel presented with evidence of Sowell's extensive abuse and neglect would have returned a different sentence.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, Sowell is entitled to relief on his claim that trial counsel provided ineffective assistance during the penalty phase of his capital trial. Because counsel's failure to investigate compelling mitigating evidence constitutes ineffective assistance warranting resentencing, it is not <span class=\"star-pagination\">*798</span> necessary to address the other sentencing issues raised in the habeas petition concerning the imposition of the death penalty, including whether counsel's failure to obtain \"reasonable and necessary\" experts constitutes ineffective assistance, whether the three-judge panel erred in applying the wrong weighing standard during sentencing, and whether the presiding judge's ex parte communication with the probation department rendered the death sentence constitutionally infirm.<sup>[1]</sup> We now turn to issues raised by Sowell concerning the guilt phase of his trial.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>A. Prosecution's Suppression of Exculpatory Evidence</i></h2>\n<p>Sowell claims that the prosecution failed to disclose material exculpatory evidence, as required by <i>Brady v. Maryland,</i> 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963). This claim is without merit for the reasons given by the district court. <i>Sowell,</i> 557 F.Supp.2d at 907-09. Sowell argues that prosecutors suppressed the statement of Jerrell Perrin, an eyewitness who lived on the same floor of the apartment building as Sowell and Graham. But Perrin's statement is not material and does not create sufficient doubt as to Sowell's guilt.</p>\n<p>In her affidavit filed in the post-conviction proceeding, Perrin testified that on the night of the shooting, she saw Sowell standing outside Graham's apartment and heard him ask Pamela Billups to return his money, and that she heard Billups respond by screaming profanities at Sowell. She testified that between twenty and thirty minutes later, she heard what she thought was a car backfiring. When she opened her door, she saw Sowell walking back to his apartment. Perrin testified that she knew Billups was a prostitute and had a reputation for dishonesty, and that Billups was known for stealing money from her customers.</p>\n<p>As the district court explained:</p>\n<blockquote>Perrin's affidavit actually contradicts petitioner's trial testimony, and the defense theory of the case, in several key respects. Petitioner testified that he did not argue with Billups about his money, yet Perrin's statement quite clearly states that she heard petitioner and Billups arguing. More importantly, Perrin's affidavit states that she heard the sounds of gunfire twenty to thirty minutes after the argument. This statement directly contradicts petitioner's testimony that the shooting happened \"far less than five minutes\" after he left the apartment, and calls into question the defense theory that this offense was committed without sufficient time to form the intent necessary for prior calculation and design.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Sowell,</i> 557 F.Supp.2d at 908-09. There is therefore not a \"reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different,\" <i>Strickler v. Greene,</i> 527 U.S. 263, 280, 119 S.Ct. 1936, 144 L.Ed.2d 286 (1999), and Sowell's <i>Brady</i> claim therefore fails.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>B. Sufficiency of the Evidence of Aggravated Murder</i></h2>\n<p>Sowell next argues that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction. He is wrong. Sowell was convicted of aggravated murder, which requires a finding of prior calculation and design. <i>See</i> O.R.C. § 2903.03(A)(1). We adopt the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*799</span> careful reasoning of the district court to the effect that the evidence presented at trial was sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Sowell acted with prior calculation and design. Most pointedly, the district court explained that:</p>\n<blockquote>[T]he shootings did not occur as a result of an instantaneous eruption or one continuous course of events. There was an initial encounter and an exchange of hostile words between petitioner and Billups that generated a decision on petitioner's part to shoot and kill Billups. After arguing with Billups about whether she had taken his money, petitioner announced his intention to get his gun and kill Billups, and he put into action a plan to achieve that result. To that end, petitioner left Graham's apartment, went down the hall to his own apartment, and retrieved his gun. Although the period of time that elapsed between the initial encounter and the shootings was brief, there was a break in the encounter, or an intervening period, during which there was a time for reflection and planning. During that time, petitioner retrieved his weapon from a different location and devised a plan to regain entry to Graham's apartment under false pretenses by using Lenora Waugh. Accordingly, . . . there was sufficient time, under all of the circumstances, for petitioner to plan the killing.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Sowell,</i> 557 F.Supp.2d at 917.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>C. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel During the Guilt Phase</i></h2>\n<p>Finally, Sowell asserts that he received ineffective assistance of counsel during the guilt phase of his trial for four reasons. First, Sowell argues that counsel failed to conduct a reasonable pretrial investigation by not interviewing the state's witnesses. Second, Sowell argues that counsel failed to call Sowell's neighbor, Jerrell Perrin, as a defense witness. Third, Sowell argues that counsel failed to cross-examine Donna Edwards, a key prosecution witness and eyewitness to the shootings. And fourth, Sowell claims that counsel failed to object to inadmissible evidence concerning Sowell's children, a false ceiling in his apartment, and his prior contacts with law enforcement. With respect to each of these arguments, counsel's performance was not deficient, or if it was, Sowell has not shown that the deficiency affected the outcome of his trial.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Counsel's failure to conduct a reasonable investigation</h2>\n<p>Sowell first argues that his attorneys did not conduct a sufficient pretrial investigation because they failed to interview the state's witnesses. Again, we adopt the reasoning of the district court, which carefully disposed of this argument, relying in part on the fact that:</p>\n<blockquote>[T]he record reflects that counsel filed for discovery and for a more definite bill of particulars, met with petitioner to discuss his options with respect to the trier of fact, and reviewed the grand jury testimony of at least four witnesses. During a pre-trial hearing, petitioner's counsel stated on the record that they had met with the prosecutor and reviewed the evidence and photographs. Counsel filed several pre-trial motions, including a motion to suppress the gun found in petitioner's apartment. Moreover, as the trial court noted, petitioner failed to present any evidence during his post-conviction proceedings suggesting that his counsel did not have copies of the witness statements to police.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Sowell,</i> 557 F.Supp.2d at 883 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p>Sowell cites the Seventh Circuit's holding in <i>Stanley v. Bartley,</i> 465 F.3d 810, 813 (7th Cir.2006), for the proposition that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*800</span> these activities were not enough. But unlike the defendant in <i>Stanley,</i> Sowell was not prejudiced by his attorneys' failure to interview the state's witnesses because he has shown no real way in which their testimony would indicate his innocence. In <i>Stanley,</i> the state's key witness, James Dean, who might well have been the murderer, testified that he was with Stanley on the night of the murder and that he saw Stanley shoot the victim in the back. <i>Id.</i> at 811. But other witnesseswho did not testify and whom defense counsel did not interviewtold the police that Dean and the victim had been involved in a violent quarrel hours before the shooting. <i>Id.</i> at 812. Here, Sowell admitted shooting Graham and Billups, and the only issue to be decided by the panel was whether Sowell had committed the acts with prior calculation and design. Sowell has presented no evidence that would undermine confidence in the panel's finding of prior calculation and design. Thus, no prejudice has been shown from counsel's performance in this regard.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Counsel's failure to call Jerrell Perrin</h2>\n<p>Sowell next argues that counsel failed to call Sowell's neighbor Perrin as a defense witness. The district court rejected this argument for the same reason it found that Perrin's statement was not material exculpatory evidencei.e., \"the Perrin affidavit supports, in many respects, the state's theory of the case, and contradicts petitioner's account of the events.\" <i>Sowell,</i> 557 F.Supp.2d at 884. The court therefore properly concluded that \"the testimony of Perrin . . . would not have affected the outcome of petitioner's trial.\" <i>Id.</i> at 885.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. Counsel's failure to cross-examine Donna Edwards</h2>\n<p>The district court's opinion also properly disposes of Sowell's argument that trial counsel performed deficiently by failing to cross-examine Donna Edwards, a key prosecution witness and eyewitness to the shooting. Sowell maintains that the testimony of Edwardsthe only individual present in the apartment who was not shot by Sowellwas inconsistent in several respects with Billups's testimony, and that counsel should have brought out these inconsistencies on cross-examination. But once again, Sowell has not established that he was prejudiced by counsel's failure to do this.</p>\n<p>With respect to counsel's performance, the district court explained:</p>\n<blockquote>Although Edwards was a witness to the actual shooting, she had little to offer regarding petitioner's interaction with Billups in the days immediately preceding the shooting. Billups, on the other hand, was subject to lengthy cross-examination by counsel, as counsel attempted to establish that the shootings \"were prefaced by a heated, passionate, and emotional exchange between Mr. Sowell and Ms. Billups.\" Petitioner's case was not won or lost by whether counsel could exonerate him as the shooter; rather, counsel's theory of the case was that petitioner did not act with prior calculation and design, and \"[t]he disputed issue centered on what precipitated the shooting.\" To that end, counsel delivered an opening statement setting forth a cohesive defense, cross-examined Billups regarding the alleged theft that was at the center of the dispute, and called petitioner to testify regarding the events in question, his relationship with Billups in the days leading up to the shooting, and his mental state at the time of the offense.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Sowell,</i> 557 F.Supp.2d at 886-87 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*801</span> The district court also properly reasoned that there was no prejudice in this regard:</p>\n<blockquote>Even if counsel would have highlighted the inconsistencies between Edwards' testimony and that of Billups, those inconsistencies concerned somewhat collateral matters. What remains consistent with respect to the testimony of the two women is that petitioner threatened to shoot Billups, left the apartment to retrieve a gun from his own apartment down the hall, enlisted the assistance of Lenora Waugh to regain entry into the apartment, entered the apartment with force, shot Graham twiceincluding a fatal close range shot to his head, then went to where Billups was hiding in a closet and fired three shots into her body at close range, stopping only when he ran out of ammunition. With respect to these essential facts, the testimony of Edwards and Billups was consistent, and petitioner cannot meet the prejudice prong of <i>Strickland.</i>\n</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 887.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>4. Counsel's failure to object to inadmissible evidence</h2>\n<p>Finally, Sowell argues that trial counsel's performance was deficient because counsel failed to object to inadmissible evidence. Sowell claims that counsel failed to object to questions by the prosecutor during Sowell's cross-examination concerning whether he conceived children out of wedlock, whether he had a false ceiling in his apartment, and whether he had prior contacts with the Cincinnati Police Department. The district court properly held that these claims were procedurally defaulted because they were never presented to the state courts. <i>Sowell,</i> 557 F.Supp.2d at 888. The state maintains that position on appeal, and Sowell does not respond to the procedural default argument.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV.</h2>\n<p>For these reasons, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p>ALICE M. BATCHELDER, Chief Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p>I agree that the district court did not err in denying habeas relief on nearly all of Sowell's claims. However, I must respectfully dissent from the portion of the majority opinion affirming the grant of habeas relief on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel at the penalty phase. On the record before us, we cannot say either that counsel failed to investigate sufficiently, or that counsel pursued a constitutionally deficient mitigation strategy. Sowell has presented fourteen affidavits of family and friends, setting forth testimony about his childhood, his family dynamics, his work history, and his adult life. However, only one of those affidavitsthat of Sowell's fatheris of any help to Sowell's case, and even then, only marginally so.</p>\n<p>Sowell's argument is that counsel did not adequately investigate and therefore could not have made a strategic decision to omit certain mitigating evidence at the sentencing phase. In these types of cases, it is obviously not enough to merely present an affidavit containing testimony that was not introduced during the penalty phase. The testimony must also be useful. <i>See </i><i>Brooks v. Bagley,</i> 513 F.3d 618, 630 (6th Cir.2008) (rejecting probative value of affidavit that did not specify what new information witnesses would have provided); <i>Martin v. Mitchell,</i> 280 F.3d 594, 614 (6th Cir.2002) (finding no prejudice where \"affidavits of [petitioner's] family members state their willingness to testify at his sentencing but do not show what mitigating evidence would have been presented had they testified\"); <i>see also </i><i>Hill v.</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*802</span> <i>Mitchell,</i> 400 F.3d 308, 319 (6th Cir.2005) (\"[T]he new evidence that a habeas petitioner presents must differ in a substantial wayin strength and subject matterfrom the evidence actually presented at sentencing.\"). The affidavit must state that the affiant would have been willing to testify, because otherwise the trial court would never hear the relevant testimony. <i>See </i><i>Turner v. Romanowski,</i> 409 Fed.Appx. 922, 929 (6th Cir.2011) (\"Turner has not produced an affidavit from Ms. Matthews herself indicating that she would be willing to testify on Turner's behalf. . . .\"); <i>Coe v. Bell,</i> 161 F.3d 320, 342 (6th Cir.1998) (rejecting ineffective assistance claim where \"most . . . witnesses were unavailable or would not cooperate with counsel at the time of pre-trial preparation\"). And to show that counsel conducted an inadequate investigation, the affidavit must at least state that counsel never spoke with the affiant. <i>Cf. </i><i>Goodwin v. Johnson,</i> 632 F.3d 301, 324 (6th Cir.2011) (\"The rest of Goodwin's familyincluding his mother, his sister, his neighbor, his friend, and the mother of his childtestified that at no time during the trial did attorneys or investigators try to contact them or ask them to testify on Goodwin's behalf.\"); <i>Morales v. Mitchell,</i> 507 F.3d 916, 932 (6th Cir.2007) (affiants stated that they would have been willing to testify but counsel never contacted them). Without the affiant's stating that he had not been contacted by counsel, we have no way of knowing if the absence of the testimony was the product of an informed strategic decision by counsel or the result of deficient performance.</p>\n<p>The majority opinion glosses over the characteristics of each individual affidavit, describing them collectively with broad, summary language: \"Affidavits of fourteen family members and friends accompanied Sowell's state post-conviction petition, recounting the violence and privation of Sowell's childhood. Many of these witnesses stated that they would have been available and willing to testify at the penalty phase but had not been asked to do so.\" In fact, only eight of the affidavits have anything to say about Sowell's childhood. Of those, only one offers any helpful testimony and states that counsel never contacted the affiant.</p>\n<p>In order to avoid the majority's error, I will examine the affidavits individually, not as an indistinguishable mass of potential mitigation testimony. Sowell submitted several affidavits from immediate family members: Henderson Sowell, Sr. (father); Henderson Sowell, Jr. (brother); Larry Sowell (brother); and Catherine Jones (sister). He submitted affidavits from his wife and other family members: Lenora Waugh (common law wife); Bobby Lee Horton (great uncle); Helen Sanderful (aunt); Ann Simpson (aunt). He submitted an affidavit from a childhood friend: Kenneth Starks. Lastly, he submitted affidavits from friends and acquaintances from his adult life: Adam Huntley (employer); Leroy Jones (friend); Jerrell Perrin (neighbor); Jimmy Wilcox (co-worker); and Walter Gabennesh (employer). In all, Sowell submitted fourteen affidavits' worth of information that counsel was allegedly ineffective for failing to discover. However, very little of it goes towards establishing ineffective assistance of counsel, some of it is not helpful for mitigation, and some of it undercuts his mitigation case.</p>\n<p>The only argument Sowell advances, and the only one that has ever gained traction in a federal court, is that counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate and present evidence concerning Sowell's difficult childhood. Therefore, any testimony presented in the fourteen affidavits regarding Sowell's adult life is not relevant to Sowell's claim. Sowell never argues to the contrary. Waugh, Huntley, Leroy Jones, Perrin, Wilcox, and Gabennesh <span class=\"star-pagination\">*803</span> knew Sowell only in his adult life, and their testimony does not shed light on anything new from his childhood, so those affidavits are not valuable.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>Of the remaining eight affiants, the only ones to actually state that Sowell's attorneys never contacted them are his father, Henderson Sowell, Sr., and his aunt, Ann Simpson. None of the others state that counsel never spoke with them.<sup>[2]</sup> In light of this, the majority opinion's statement that, \"[C]ounsel did not interview any of Sowell's family members, including his father, brothers, sisters, and other relatives,\" is quite an overstatement.</p>\n<p>Because the affidavits of the six other relevant affiants are silent on the matter, we cannot assume that trial counsel never spoke with them. This is simply a matter of recognizing where the burden of proof lieswith Sowell, the petitioner. <i>See </i><i>Strickland v. Washington,</i> 466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984); <i>Fautenberry v. Mitchell,</i> 515 F.3d 614, 634 (6th Cir.2008); <i>Higgins v. Renico,</i> 470 F.3d 624, 632 (6th Cir.2006) (\"In essence, a defendant has the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the counsel guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment.\" (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)). The silence of the relevant affidavits on whether or not counsel ever spoke to the affiants cannot lead us to assume away Sowell's burden of proof. Furthermore, counsel's performance is entitled to \"a strong presumption that [it] falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\" <i>Strickland,</i> 466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052. Because of this presumption, the burden of proof is heavy. <i>See </i><i>Short v. United States,</i> 471 F.3d 686, 692 (6th Cir.2006) (\"[D]efendants alleging ineffective assistance of counsel bear `a heavy burden of proof.'\" (quoting <i>Whiting v. Burt,</i> 395 F.3d 602, 617 (6th Cir.2005))). This presumption means nothing if we automatically assume that counsel did not speak to valuable witnesses, absent evidence to the contrary. Indeed, that would be a presumption that counsel did not perform adequately.</p>\n<p>That is especially the case here where we have no testimony, no affidavits, and no records whatsoever from the witnesses best able to speak on the extent of counsel's investigation: trial counsel themselves.<sup>[3]</sup><i>See </i><i>Carter v. Mitchell,</i> 443 F.3d 517, 531 (6th Cir.2006) (\"[C]uriously absent from the record is any statement from trial counsel describing what he did or did not do in investigating [petitioner's] background. By not detailing trial counsel's efforts to learn of [petitioner's] background, [petitioner] has provided no basis for a finding that trial counsel's investigation was unreasonable.\"). True, that is not always required. <i>See Woodard v. Mitchell,</i> 410 Fed.Appx. 869, 875 (6th Cir.2010). But it is \"obvious . . . that [trial counsel's] testimony, when available, is preferred.\" <i>Id.</i> This Court has never held that a petitioner can establish ineffective assistance by omitting all direct evidence of counsel's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*804</span> investigation and presenting affidavits from persons who may or may not have been contacted by counsel, setting out their potential testimony that counsel may or may not have known. To allow that is to do away with both the presumption that counsel performed adequately and the petitioner's burden of proof.</p>\n<p>The Court's holding today provides a roadmap to future habeas petitioners seeking to show ineffective assistance of counsel due to inadequate mitigation investigation. First, the petitioner should present no evidence regarding trial counsel's investigation. Next, he should submit affidavits from people setting forth any evidence that counsel did not introduce at trial, regardless of whether or not counsel was aware of it, regardless of whether or not counsel spoke with the affiants. Lastly, he must make sure the affiants do not mention whether or not counsel ever spoke to them during the mitigation investigation, or whether or not they were willing to testify at trial. It is that easy. Even if counsel did speak with the affiants but chose not to call them as witnesses, the affiants don't even have to lie about itthey just have to remain silent on the matter.</p>\n<p>I now return to the only two possibly relevant affidavits. Sowell's aunt, Ann Simpson, would not have provided useful testimony. She stated in her affidavit that, \"Billy Joe was a happy go lucky youth. He was always clean and liked to dress in nice clothing.\" Also undercutting the image of a chaotic and abusive relationship between his parents, she stated, \"Henderson and his wife, Mary Jane, appeared to get along okay.\"</p>\n<p>This leaves Sowell's father, Henderson Sowell, Sr., as the only relevant person for whom we have <i>any</i> evidence to say that Sowell's counsel never contacted him. The testimony the father presents in his affidavit is relatively unremarkable. Most of it concerns Henderson, Sr.'s own life and upbringing. It mentions Henderson's alcohol use, separation of the family, and the family's impoverished housing conditions. It does not contain any of the startling and vivid stories from Sowell's childhood: an infant sibling dying of starvation, rats biting the children, the father's abandonment of the children, the father's beating Billy Joe until a neighbor intervened, the father's sexual molestation of Catherine, and the father's threatening to burn Catherine to death. Those statements are from either Sowell himself (in his post-sentence interview with Dr. Hawgood) or his siblings. Even given Henderson, Sr.'s statement that, \"In 1983, I was not contacted by Billy Joe's attorneys or their assistants,\" the testimony he would have offered to them was of minimal value.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, assuming that trial counsel had all of the proffered evidence in front of him, I cannot say that their decision not to put forth testimony about Sowell's childhood was not the product of a strategic decision. I agree with the majority that the two strategies of emphasizing Sowell's deprived childhood and emphasizing his good character in his adult life are not necessarily incompatible. But as the affidavits submitted by family members make clear, the testimony about his miserable childhood would also include testimony that could harm Sowell's mitigation case. Each affidavit that included evidence about Sowell's difficult childhood also mentioned his temper and his violent tendencies. While his difficult childhood would probably paint a more sympathetic picture of Sowell, it would also paint a picture of a man inclined towards violence. The mitigation testimony of Sowell's friends that counsel did present painted a picture of a kind, generous man, with no mention whatsoever of Sowell's violent tendencies. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*805</span> True, the psychological reports mentioned Sowell's violent tendencies. But it could certainly have been a strategic decision by counsel to have friends give positive testimony about Sowell's character, while reserving any analysis of his violent tendencies to the expert witnesses. This would emphasize that his violent outburst that resulted in these crimes, while predictable to the experts in psychology and psychiatry, was surprising and out of character to those who knew Sowell best. Pursuing an additional strategy that focused on his difficult upbringing would not be inconsistent, but in this case it would be at great cost because it would bring to light his violent tendencies even more.</p>\n<p>The majority dismisses this concern by employing a double standard. The majority minimizes the damaging effect of the testimony about Sowell's violent tendencies by assuring itself that the psychological reports available to the court at sentencing already \"thoroughly documented Sowell's short temper and his propensity for responding violently to perceived injustices, especially when drinking.\" Similarly, the psychological reports briefly documented Sowell's difficult upbringing.<sup>[4]</sup> Of course, on these matters, the majority states that testimony from family members would be far more vivid and effective at describing Sowell's difficult childhood: \"These specifics had far more evidentiary power than the abstractions and oblique references contained in the experts' written reports.\" Why would specifics about his violent tendencies not also have \"more evidentiary power\"? Apparently, the advantage of specific first-hand testimony over psychological reports only works in Sowell's favor and never against it.</p>\n<p>I dissent from the majority opinion's affirmance of the district court's grant of relief because a careful examination of the evidence before us reveals that Sowell cannot show either that his counsel undertook an inadequate investigation or that counsel's choice of mitigation strategy was unreasonable. The majority can only find grounds for relief by failing to examine the affidavits individually, presuming them all to be unequivocally relevant and helpful to Sowell, and presuming that trial counsel did <i>not</i> perform an adequate investigation. As for Sowell's other arguments for relief that the district court rejected and the majority did not need to addressthat counsel should have objected to the presentence investigation report and should have obtained additional experts, challenging an ex parte communication between a trial judge and the probation department, and the trial court's weighing standard at sentencingI would deny relief on those claims for substantially the same reasons that the district court did.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  To the extent that this claim can be read as a challenge not only to Sowell's sentence but also to his conviction, we reject it for the reasons given by the district court. <i>Sowell,</i> 557 F.Supp.2d at 893-97.</p>\n<p>[1]  Furthermore, Waugh actually did testify at the sentencing phase.</p>\n<p>[2]  Even Larry Sowell, petitioner's brother, states only that he was not asked to testify. He does not say anything about whether or not counsel ever spoke with him.</p>\n<p>[3]  It is also particularly notable that two of these affiants are willing and able to say that they were never contacted by trial counsel and would have been willing to testify if asked, e.g., Henderson Sowell, Sr. Aff., some stated only that they would have been willing to testify, e.g., Larry Sowell Aff., and others say nothing at all on the matter, e.g., Catherine Jones Aff. The most logical interpretation of the affidavits is that, astoundingly, they each mean what they say and not what they do not say.</p>\n<p>[4]  \"He describes his father as having been a strict disciplinarian. . . .

BATCHELDER, C.J. (pp. 801-05), delivered a separate opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>OPINION</h2>\n<p>ROGERS, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>Billy Joe Sowell was convicted of aggravated murder and sentenced to death by a three-judge panel in 1983. At sentencing, counsel's mitigation strategy was to portray Sowell as a good person who lost his temper under the influence of drugs and alcohol. Counsel pursued this strategy despite having available the reports of several court-appointed mental health experts, which hinted at Sowell's difficult upbringing but did not provide specific details about his severely impoverished and abusive childhood. Despite these reports, counsel did not conduct an investigation into Sowell's background or interview any of his family members. Had they done so, there is a reasonable probability that the additional mitigating evidence would have led at least one of the panel judges to vote against the death penalty. The district court therefore properly granted habeas relief on this basis.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>The facts underlying Sowell's conviction are not in dispute. As we did in our initial review of Sowell's petition, we rely on the Ohio Court of Appeals' version of the facts:</p>\n<blockquote>The record discloses that [Sowell] and [Calvert] Graham resided in adjacent apartments on the third floor of an apartment building in downtown Cincinnati. [Sowell] was the resident manager of the building and became acquainted with Graham, who performed occasional odd jobs at the apartment building. After Graham became a resident in [Sowell's] apartment building, the two men developed a friendly relationship and visited one another in their respective residences.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>On May 1, 1983, three days prior to the instant offenses, [Sowell] was a guest in Graham's apartment. Also present were Donna Edwards (Edwards), a woman with whom Graham shared the apartment, and [Pam] Billups [a former prostitute who had been visiting Graham and Edwards]. Graham offered two marijuana cigarettes to [Sowell], which he accepted. Thereafter [Sowell] left the apartment in the company of Billups and proceeded to a nearby restaurant where he purchased dinner for her. En route to the restaurant, [Sowell] smoked the second marijuana cigarette, having consumed the first at <span class=\"star-pagination\">*787</span> Graham's residence. Thereafter the pair made their way to a hotel where [Sowell] rented a room. There was conflicting testimony concerning the events that transpired thereafter. However, it is not disputed that [Sowell] eventually lost consciousness, having consumed an unspecified quantity of wine during the evening in addition to the marijuana. The next morning [Sowell] made his way back to his residence, stopping along his route to obtain breakfast for Billups.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>[Sowell] next encountered Billups on the afternoon of May 4, 1983. Billups was in the company of Edwards and the trio passed in the doorway of a store but did not acknowledge one another. As will be seen, this seemingly inconsequential meeting gained significance later in the day.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>That evening [Sowell] returned to his apartment building after, according to his testimony, visiting no less than five taverns and consuming at least one double shot of vodka at each stop. Upon returning to his apartment building [Sowell] realized that he was not in the mood to retire for the evening, and instead presented himself at Graham's apartment. Graham greeted [Sowell] and invited him inside, where Edwards and Billups were also present. Graham produced a marijuana cigarette which was consumed by all four occupants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>[Sowell] testified before the trial court that following the consumption of the marijuana, he fell asleep for a short time. When he awoke the others were still present and [Sowell] discovered that approximately $190 had been removed from his trouser pocket. At first [Sowell] thought that the trio was playing a joke upon him; however, his requests for the return of his money received no response. [Sowell] further testified that Graham then picked up a knife and ordered [Sowell] to leave the residence. [Sowell] complied and departed, but he was extremely angry as a result of his loss.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Both Billups and Edwards told the trial court that [Sowell's] visit to the apartment on the day in question was at first friendly. However, [Sowell] soon became agitated and accused Billups of being unsociable in that she did not speak to him earlier that afternoon. [Sowell] also accused Billups of stealing $24 from him during their encounter three days earlier. When [Sowell] referred to Billups in terms meant to insult her pedigree, Graham ordered [Sowell] to leave the premises. [Sowell] left, stating that he was going to obtain his gun, return and shoot Billups.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>[Sowell] went directly to his apartment where he directed his common-law wife, Lenora Waugh (Waugh), to bring his gun to him. Waugh complied with that request, as well as with [Sowell's] instructions to accompany him to Graham's apartment. Upon returning to Graham's door, Waugh, at [Sowell's] instruction, knocked and indicated to those inside that she was a woman named Portia. Graham responded to the door and opened it. Edwards and Billups testified, and the trial court found, that [Sowell] forced his way into the apartment, firing a bullet from his handgun into the ceiling as he entered. [Sowell] demanded to know Billups's whereabouts and threatened to shoot her. Graham was able to calm [Sowell] and began to escort him from the apartment and to close the door, whereupon [Sowell] suddenly turned and shot Graham in the abdomen. As Graham fell, [Sowell] fired a second shot into Graham's skull. Graham fell to the floor, mortally wounded.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>[Sowell] next made his way to the closet in which Billups was cowering, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*788</span> and fired three bullets into her body. [Sowell] next placed the gun to Billups's forehead and pulled the trigger. However, the gun did not expel a bullet because it no longer contained ammunition. [Sowell] left the apartment after warning Edwards not to leave the premises or he would shoot her also. [Sowell] returned to his apartment, obtained money and made his way to a nearby tavern where he was apprehended by the police.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>[Sowell] testified regarding the shootings and told the court that he returned to Graham's apartment to demand his money and that he was confronted by Graham, who was armed with a knife. [Sowell] stated that it was only after Graham made a furtive movement that [Sowell] began shooting at Graham, and that one of the bullets struck the ceiling. [Sowell] explained his conduct as follows: \"It just, I just clocked out. When I seen that person going this way I just pivoted, I pivoted on my gun, I was shooting, I was angry, I started shooting, I just started shooting everybody I seen.\"</blockquote>\n<p><i>State v. Sowell,</i> No. C-830835, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1986</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">9082</span></span>, at *1-2 (Ohio Ct.App. Aug. 20, 1986) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p>Sowell was indicted on one count of aggravated murder for the shooting of Graham, and one count of attempted murder for the shooting of Billups. The aggravated murder count contained a capital specification alleging that the shooting was part of a course of conduct involving the purposeful killing of or attempt to kill two or more persons. <i>See</i> O.R.C. § 2929.04(a)(5). Relying on the advice of trial counsel, Sowell waived his right to a jury trial and opted for trial by a three-judge panel, <i>see</i> O.R.C. § 2945.06, which unanimously found Sowell guilty of both counts, including the capital specification.</p>\n<p>The defense's mitigating evidence consisted of an unsworn statement by Sowell, the testimony of five witnesses who knew Sowell as an adult, and the submission of several psychological reports prepared by court-appointed mental health experts. Also before the panel was the presentence investigation (PSI) report prepared by the probation department. None of this material revealed any substantial details about Sowell's background or family history. The panel unanimously sentenced Sowell to death on the aggravated murder count, and to a term of seven to twenty-five years of imprisonment on the attempted murder count. Sowell's conviction and sentence were upheld on direct appeal and his petition for state post-conviction relief was unsuccessful at trial and on appeal.</p>\n<p>Sowell's federal habeas petition was initially dismissed without prejudice for failure to exhaust the Ohio Supreme Court's <i>Murnahan</i> procedure for raising claims of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel. <i>See </i><i>State v. Murnahan,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">63</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">60</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">584</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1204</span></span>, 1209 (1992). After the Ohio courts denied his <i>Murnahan</i> motions, Sowell renewed his federal habeas petition on May 24, 1994, raising fifty-two claims. The district court conducted an evidentiary hearing allowing Sowell to develop one of these claimsthat his waiver of a jury trial was not knowing and intelligent. Our initial review of Sowell's petition reversed the district court's conditional grant of habeas relief on that claim. <i>Sowell v. Bradshaw,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"786645\"><a href=\"/opinion/786645/billy-joe-sowell-v-margaret-bradshaw-warden/\"><span class=\"volume\">372</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">821</span></a></span>, 838 (6th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p>The district court reopened Sowell's petition on November 16, 2004, and addressed his remaining claims. In a carefully reasoned opinion, the district court found that Sowell received ineffective assistance of counsel during the penalty phase of his trial. <i>Sowell v. Collins,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2239129\"><a href=\"/opinion/2239129/sowell-v-collins/\"><span class=\"volume\">557</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">843</span></a></span> (S.D.Ohio 2008). After reviewing the mitigating evidence presented <span class=\"star-pagination\">*789</span> to the three-judge panel, the court compared this with the additional mitigating evidence that was submitted in Sowell's state post-conviction petition. The court noted that \"virtually all of the evidence presented [at sentencing] concerned good deeds performed by petitioner during his adult life.\" <i>Id.</i> at 852. In contrast, the court noted, the additional mitigating information concerned evidence that \"petitioner grew up in extreme poverty and suffered severe abuse and neglect as a child.\" <i>Id.</i> at 852-53.</p>\n<p>The district court found that counsel's failure to discover this entirely different category of mitigating evidence was constitutionally deficient performance. <i>Id.</i> at 866-71 (citing <i>Strickland v. Washington,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span>, 690, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2052</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">80</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">674</span></a></span> (1984)). Counsel did not perform an adequate sentencing-phase investigation, the court reasoned, because they \"fail[ed] to interview members of petitioner's family\" and \"ignored known leads that might have helped them to prepare their case in mitigation.\" <i>Id.</i> at 870-71. The district court found that Sowell was prejudiced by his attorneys' performance because \"a reasonable probability exists that the outcome would have been different had more detailed information been presented regarding petitioner's tragic childhood and social development.\" <i>Id.</i> at 871. The court rejected the argument that this evidence was \"merely cumulative of information that was presented\" in the written reports of the court-appointed experts, because the new information was \"significant,\" \"qualitatively different,\" and \"would have painted an entirely different portrait\" of Sowell. <i>Id.</i> at 872. The court granted a conditional writ on Sowell's ineffective-assistance claim and denied relief on all of the remaining grounds.</p>\n<p>The Government appeals the district court's conditional grant of habeas relief on the ineffective-assistance claim. Sowell cross-appeals, challenging the district court's dismissal of five of his claims: (1) ineffective assistance of counsel during the trial's guilt phase; (2) violation of Sowell's due process rights based on an ex parte meeting between the presiding judge and members of the probation department; (3) certain alleged sentencing errors; (4) insufficient evidence to support his convictions; and (5) suppression of exculpatory evidence by the prosecution. For substantially the reasons set out by the district court, the grant of a conditional writ on the claim that counsel were ineffective during the penalty-phase proceeding was proper, and Sowell's remaining grounds for habeas relief are without merit.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>This case is not governed by the strict limits on federal habeas review imposed by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA). Because Sowell filed his habeas petition in 1994, the pre-AEDPA standard of review applies. <i>Sowell,</i> 372 F.3d at 828. Under this standard, a state court's factual findings are entitled to a presumption of correctness that is rebuttable by convincing evidence, <i>McQueen v. Scroggy,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"729638\"><a href=\"/opinion/729638/harold-mcqueen-jr-v-gene-scroggy-warden/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1302</span></a></span>, 1310 (6th Cir.1996), while the state court's determination of questions of federal law or mixed questions of federal law and fact are reviewed de novo, <i>Coleman v. Mitchell,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"772579\"><a href=\"/opinion/772579/alton-coleman-v-betty-mitchell-warden/\"><span class=\"volume\">244</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">533</span></a></span>, 538 (6th Cir.2001). The pre-AEDPA standard of review \"entitle[s] [Sowell] to have the federal habeas court make its own independent determination of his federal claim, without being bound by the determination on the merits of that claim reached in the state proceedings.\" <i>Wainwright v. Sykes,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109717\"><a href=\"/opinion/109717/wainwright-v-sykes/\"><span class=\"volume\">433</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">72</span></a></span>, 87, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109717\"><a href=\"/opinion/109717/wainwright-v-sykes/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ineffective Assistance of Counsel During the Penalty Phase</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Application of this standard leads to the conclusion that Sowell received ineffective assistance during the penalty phase of his capital trial. Trial counsel failed to uncover and present evidence of Sowell's deprived and abusive childhood, which left the sentencing panel unaware of a substantial body of mitigating evidence that could have led at least one of the judges to vote against the death penalty. Because we uphold the district court's determination that counsel's failure to conduct an adequate sentencing-phase investigation fell short of constitutional standards, it is not necessary to address Sowell's other arguments that his counsel's performance during the penalty phase was deficient.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Deficient performance</h2>\n<p>Sowell's attorneys performed deficiently because they did not interview Sowell's family members or investigate references to his horrific childhood contained in the reports of court-appointed mental health experts. Counsel's failure to interview Sowell's family was inconsistent with their obligation to conduct a thorough sentencing-phase investigation, <i>see </i><i>Porter v.

Because they were not aware of this additional mitigating evidence, Sowell's attorneys were not in a position to make a conscious, strategic decision about the type of mitigation case to present at sentencing.</p>\n<p>Counsel's mitigation strategy at sentencing was to present Sowell as a good person who lost his temper because he felt betrayed by his friend Graham. The mitigation evidence consisted of Sowell's unsworn statement, the testimony of five witnessesLenora Waugh, two probation officers, and two work colleagueswho knew Sowell as an adult, and the submission of several competency and capacity evaluations. As the district court noted, almost all of the testimony involved good deeds Sowell had done as an adult. <i>Sowell,</i> 557 F.Supp.2d at 852. The witnesses gave specific examples of times when Sowell had helped them in need and had attempted to prevent crimes in his community. They testified that Sowell was kind-hearted, trustworthy, a hard worker, and a good father. The psychological reports likewise described Sowell as \"a most righteous man with a high moral sense\" who was \"proud of his good works.\" But their discussion of Sowell's background was perfunctory, and none of the witnesses shed any light on Sowell's childhood or family history. Direct examination of the six witnesses totaled only thirty-four pages of transcript. Counsel failed to call any family members to testify, and the panel did not learn anything substantial about Sowell's formative years.</p>\n<p>There is nothing wrong with a mitigation strategy that emphasizes a capital defendant's redeeming qualities. But Sowell's attorneys did not make a conscious choice among available alternative strategies because they overlooked an entire category of compelling mitigating evidenceevidence that might have caused the sentencing panel to rethink its assessment of Sowell's moral culpability. Counsel's failure to present evidence of Sowell's horrific childhood resulted from their ignorance of this evidence, not from an informed choice between mutually exclusive mitigation theories. Sowell's attorneys failed to uncover this additional mitigating <span class=\"star-pagination\">*791</span> evidenceand therefore performed deficientlyfor two reasons.</p>\n<p>First, counsel did not interview any of Sowell's family members, including his father, brothers, sisters, and other relatives. Affidavits of fourteen family members and friends accompanied Sowell's state post-conviction petition, recounting the violence and privation of Sowell's childhood. Many of these witnesses stated that they would have been available and willing to testify at the penalty phase but had not been asked to do so. Sowell's attorneys did not contact a single member of his immediate family, and only Sowell's father spoke with the social worker who compiled information for the psychological evaluations.</p>\n<p>Counsel's failure to interview Sowell's family fell short of the \"reasonable\" investigation required by the Sixth Amendment, as well as the then-prevailing standards \"articulated by the American Bar Association (ABA)standards to which we long have referred as `guides to determining what is reasonable.'\" <i>Wiggins,</i> 539 U.S. at 524, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130159\"><a href=\"/opinion/130159/wiggins-v-smith-warden/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

These standards required counsel to make efforts to \"`explore all avenues leading to facts relevant to . . . the penalty in the event of conviction,'\" including evidence of Sowell's \"`background, education, . . . family relationships, and the like.'\" <i>Bobby v. Van Hook,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1758\"><a href=\"/opinion/1758/bobby-v-van-hook/\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In choosing not to interview Sowell's family members, his attorneys failed in their obligation to conduct a \"thorough\" investigation.</p>\n<p>Of course, these professional standards did not require Sowell's attorneys to contact every person who ever knew Sowell during every period of his life, and \"there comes a point at which evidence from more distant relatives can reasonably be expected to be only cumulative, and the search for it distractive from more important duties.\" <i>Van Hook,</i> 130 S.Ct. at 19 (2009). But Sowell's attorneys stopped well short of that point. While there is a \"strong presumption that counsel's conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance,\" <i>Strickland,</i> 466 U.S. at 689, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2052</span></a></span>). An attorney does not make a strategic decision by choosing to ignore a body of evidence, the contents of which are unknown. That is not strategy.</p>\n<p>Because counsel did not interview Sowell's family members, the panel did not learn that Sowell's early life was abusive, impoverished, and totally chaotic. The affidavits of Sowell's father, brothers, sisters, and family friends describe in vivid detail the physical and psychological abuse Sowell endured as a child. Sowell's father was a serious alcoholic who beat his wife and children on a regular basis. His father was frequently absent for long periods of time, but when he was home, the family lived in terror. To avoid setting off a drunken outburst, Sowell and his siblings would not speak while their father was home. Sowell's mother was only 15 years old when she got married. She lacked basic parenting skills and vocally wished her children were dead or had never been <span class=\"star-pagination\">*792</span> born. She was petrified of Sowell's father and would not defend the children from his drunken beatings. To escape the domestic violence, she often fled the home, leaving the children without supervision for days at a time. Sowell's parents eventually divorced, but Sowell and his siblings remained with their father. The abuse continued into Sowell's adolescent years. On one occasion, Sowell's father tied him and his sister JoAnn to a chair and beat them until a neighbor intervened. Sowell's father also sexually molested Sowell's sister Catherine and threatened to pour gasoline over her and watch her burn if she reported it.</p>\n<p>The affidavits also paint a picture of extreme poverty. The panel did not learn, for example, that Sowell's infant brother died of starvation and that Sowell and his siblings had to beg for and steal food. The children were bitten by rats, infected with worms, and lacked sufficient clothing and shoes. The entire familyall six childrenlived in a small trailer and later moved into an unfinished basement that lacked electricity or running water. By the time Sowell was fourteen, he was living in a junkyard, on his own, in a tent. None of Sowell's siblings has fared any better in life. JoAnn became a prostitute and killed her pimp. She died a week before the murder in this case. Larry Sowell shot his brother Benny and served time for manslaughter. Benny and Henderson Sowell, Jr. were both incarcerated for burglary. Four of the five children who survived were alcohol or drug addicts. \"[A] competent attorney, aware of this history, would have introduced it at sentencing,\" <i>Wiggins,</i> 539 U.S. at 535, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130159\"><a href=\"/opinion/130159/wiggins-v-smith-warden/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2527</span></a></span>, and counsel's failure to do so here was deficient.</p>\n<p>Second, counsel failed to uncover compelling evidence of Sowell's background because they did not follow up on the obvious leads contained in the written reports of court-appointed experts. \"In assessing the reasonableness of an attorney's investigation, . . . a court must consider not only the quantum of evidence already known to counsel, but also whether the known evidence would lead a reasonable attorney to investigate further.\" <i>Wiggins,</i> 539 U.S. at 527, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130159\"><a href=\"/opinion/130159/wiggins-v-smith-warden/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2527</span></a></span>. Our decision in <i>Harries v. Bell,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"791271\"><a href=\"/opinion/791271/ronald-r-harries-petitioner-appelleecross-appellant-v-ricky-bell/\"><span class=\"volume\">417</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">631</span></a></span> (6th Cir.2005), illustrates the point. In that case, we held that interviews conducted by counsel \"produced viable leads regarding Harries's poor mental health and troubled family background,\" and held that \"[c]ounsel's failure to follow these promising leads . . . was deficient.\" <i>Id.</i> at 639.</p>\n<p>Here, the psychological reports would have prompted a reasonable attorney to expand the investigation beyond the redeeming aspects of Sowell's adult life. The district court summarized the indications of Sowell's troubled childhood in these reports as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>Dr. [Nancy] Schmidtgoessling's mitigation report noted that petitioner had a \"rough childhood\" and \"an unhappy home life.\" She reported that petitioner experienced a \"lack of adequate food, clothing and material goods as well as [a] lack of close parental nurturance.\" According to her report, petitioner felt \"abandoned, angry, without significant stable relationships, and conscious of the need to defend himself in a dangerous, hostile environment.\" She relayed that petitioner was \"on his own\" at a young age, that he skipped school, and that he ran away for days at a time. Dr. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*793</span> Schmidtgoessling noted petitioner's history of depression and alcohol abuse. Likewise, Dr. [James] Titchener reported that petitioner's mother was distant, that she frequently left her family, and that her abandonment was responsible for much of the anger and hostility petitioner experienced. Dr. [William] Walters noted that petitioner's father was a \"strict disciplinarian\" and that the Sowell family was very poor. Walters, Schmidtgoessling, Titchener and [Dr. Emmett] Cooper all noted that alcohol and marijuana use contributed to that events leading up to the murder.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Sowell,</i> 557 F.Supp.2d at 869. These hints of a childhood filled with privation and abuse should have moved Sowell's attorneys to expand the scope of their investigation. Instead, Sowell's attorneys \"ignored pertinent avenues for investigation of which [they] should have been aware.\" <i>Porter,</i> 130 S.Ct. at 453.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court's decision in <i>Wiggins</i> strongly supports the district court's conclusion that counsel performed deficiently in failing to follow up on these leads. In <i>Wiggins,</i> counsel abandoned their investigation of Wiggins' background \"after having acquired only rudimentary knowledge of his history from a narrow set of sources.\" 539 U.S. at 524, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130159\"><a href=\"/opinion/130159/wiggins-v-smith-warden/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2527</span></a></span>. The PSI report and Department of Social Services (DSS) records that counsel obtained revealed that Wiggins' mother was a chronic alcoholic; that Wiggins was \"shuttled from foster home to foster home and displayed some emotional difficulties\" while there; that he had \"frequent, lengthy absences\" from school; and that, \"on at least one occasion, his mother left him and his siblings alone for days without food.\" <i>Id.</i> at 525, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130159\"><a href=\"/opinion/130159/wiggins-v-smith-warden/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2527</span></a></span>. Despite these promising leads, counsel did not investigate further. The Supreme Court held that \"any reasonably competent attorney would have realized that pursuing these leads was necessary to making an informed choice among possible defenses.\" <i>Id.</i> at 525, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130159\"><a href=\"/opinion/130159/wiggins-v-smith-warden/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2527</span></a></span>. \"Counsel's decision not to expand their investigation beyond the PSI and DSS records\" was \"unreasonable in light of what counsel actually discovered in the DSS records.\" <i>Id.</i> at 524, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130159\"><a href=\"/opinion/130159/wiggins-v-smith-warden/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2527</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>More recently in <i>Porter,</i> 130 S.Ct. at 453, the Supreme Court held that counsel's failure to interview the defendant's family members and obtain school, medical, or military service records was constitutionally deficient. <i>Id.</i> Like the counsel in <i>Wiggins,</i> Porter's attorney did not follow up on leads contained in court-ordered competency evaluations, which \"collectively reported Porter's very few years of regular school, his military service and wounds sustained in combat, and his father's `over-discipline[e].'\" <i>Id.</i> This court has also recently found deficient performance where defense counsel did not follow up on leads developed from a narrow set of sources. <i>Goodwin v. Johnson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"183324\"><a href=\"/opinion/183324/goodwin-v-johnson/\"><span class=\"volume\">632</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">301</span></a></span> (6th Cir.2011). In that case, defense counsel interviewed some of Goodwin's family members, but did not contact his mother, sister, neighbors and friends, or the mother of Goodwin's child. We held that \"[t]he information Goodwin's counsel possessed, obviously incomplete, should have triggered a more thorough investigation of Goodwin's past.\" <i>Id.</i> at 324.</p>\n<p>As the district court recognized, \"[t]his is not a case where counsel presented absolutely no evidence in mitigation.\" <i>Sowell,</i> 557 F.Supp.2d at 871. The evidence counsel did present was intended to draw out the redeeming qualities that made Sowell's life worth sparing. But counsel's decision to emphasize Sowell's worthwhile adult life while leaving out his horrific childhood is not easily considered a reasonable mitigation strategy, particularly <span class=\"star-pagination\">*794</span> where the additional evidence would not have been inconsistent withand might even have strengthenedthe mitigation case counsel did present. \"The evidence concerning petitioner's horrific upbringing that counsel failed to present would have bolstered their mitigation case by demonstrating that petitioner was capable of generosity and good acts in spite of the upbringing that he endured.\" <i>Id.</i> at 872. This case is therefore different from <i>Sears v. Upton,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"149653\"><a href=\"/opinion/149653/sears-v-upton/\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1025</span></a></span> (2010) (per curiam), where counsel's mitigation strategy of emphasizing Sears' \"stable, loving,\" and \"privileged\" childhood backfired when the prosecutor used this evidence to argue that Sears was even more culpable than he would have been had he grown up as a \"deprived child from the inner city . . . who[m] society ha[d] turned its back on at an early age.\"</p>\n<p>More importantly, even if a decision to \"emphasize the good rather than the bad\" were a reasonable mitigation strategy in the abstract, <i>Sowell,</i> 557 F.Supp.2d at 871, it was not reasonable in this case because counsel were not fully aware of their options. The Supreme Court has found deficient performance even in \"cases in which counsel presented what could be described as a superficially reasonable mitigation theory during the penalty phase.\" <i>Sears,</i> 130 S.Ct. at 3266. Thus, notwithstanding the mitigation case counsel did present, our \"principal concern in deciding whether counsel exercised reasonable professional judgment is whether the investigation supporting counsel's decision not to introduce mitigation evidence of [defendant's] background <i>was itself reasonable.</i>\" <i>Wiggins,</i> 539 U.S. at 523, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130159\"><a href=\"/opinion/130159/wiggins-v-smith-warden/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2527</span></a></span> (emphasis in original). In this case, as in <i>Wiggins,</i> \"counsel were not in a position to make a reasonable strategic choice . . . because the investigation supporting their choice was unreasonable.\" <i>Id.</i> at 536, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130159\"><a href=\"/opinion/130159/wiggins-v-smith-warden/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2527</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>As the district court explained, this is also not a case where counsel could have legitimately feared that digging deeper into Sowell's past would turn up evidence that was more damaging than favorable. <i>Sowell,</i> 557 F.Supp.2d at 873. Sowell's entire criminal record and arrest history were included in the PSI report and the mental health evaluations that were submitted to the panel at sentencing. The psychological reports also thoroughly documented Sowell's short temper and his propensity for responding violently to perceived injustices, especially when drinking. Thus, the panel already knew the worst. Further investigation could only have helped Sowell. This case therefore differs from <i>Wood v. Allen,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1742\"><a href=\"/opinion/1742/wood-v-allen/\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">738</span></a></span> (2010), where counsel had made a strategic decision not to investigte Wood's mental deficiencies, despite having available a favorable expert report on the matter, because the report also contained details about Wood's 19 earlier arrests and his attempt to murder a prior ex-girlfriendrebuttal evidence that counsel had been successful in excluding at trial. <i>Id.</i> at 850 n. 3, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1742\"><a href=\"/opinion/1742/wood-v-allen/\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">841</span></a></span>. Sowell's case is also different from <i>Burger v. Kemp,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111957\"><a href=\"/opinion/111957/burger-v-kemp/\"><span class=\"volume\">483</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">776</span></a></span>, 794, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111957\"><a href=\"/opinion/111957/burger-v-kemp/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">638</span></a></span> (1987), in which a limited investigation was reasonable because all potential witnesses interviewed by counsel provided information that was more harmful than helpful. Without knowledge of the mitigating side of Sowell's background, his attorneys could not have made a conscious, strategic judgment that this evidence would do more harm than good.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Prejudice</h2>\n<p>Turning to the second prong of <i>Strickland,</i> Sowell was prejudiced by his <span class=\"star-pagination\">*795</span> attorneys' performance because, as the district court found, \"there is a reasonable likelihood that at least one member of the three-judge panel would have voted in favor of a sentence less than death if the panel had been informed of Sowell's dysfunctional childhood.\" <i>Sowell,</i> 557 F.Supp.2d at 866. The additional mitigating evidence differs in strength and in subject matter from the evidence the panel heard, and the evidence is therefore not cumulative. And far from being inconsistent with counsel's mitigation strategy, the information concerning Sowell's background would have strengthened counsel's mitigation theory that Sowell was a good person because it was highly relevant to any assessment of his moral worth.</p>\n<p>To establish prejudice, Sowell must demonstrate that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. <i>See </i><i>Strickland,</i> 466 U.S. at 694, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2527</span></a></span>. Thus, in a capital case, \"the question is whether there is a reasonable probability that, absent the errors, the sentencerincluding an appellate court, to the extent it independently reweighs the evidencewould have concluded that the balance of aggravating and mitigating circumstances did not warrant death.\" <i>Strickland,</i> 466 U.S. at 695, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2052</span></a></span>. Additional mitigating evidence that is \"merely cumulative\" of that already presented does not undermine the results of sentencing. <i>Broom v. Mitchell,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"793677\"><a href=\"/opinion/793677/romell-broom-v-betty-mitchell/\"><span class=\"volume\">441</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">392</span></a></span>, 410 (6th Cir.2006).

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1495</span></a></span>, \"the graphic description of [defendant's] childhood, filled with abuse and privation, . . . might well have influenced the [panel's] appraisal of his moral culpability.\" Though the mitigating evidence regarding Sowell's childhood is extensive, the panel heard only about Sowell's adult life. The testimony at sentencing supports counsel's theory that Sowell's life had residual value. But what is key to the prejudice inquiry is the evidence the panel did <i>not</i> hearspecific details about Sowell's \"nightmarish\" childhood. <i>See id.</i> at 395, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145122\"><a href=\"/opinion/145122/williams-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

There is no question that the additional mitigating evidence is stronger than anything the panel learned about Sowell's background from the written reports of Drs. Schmidtgoessling, Titchener, and Walters. These reports spoke in generalities that lacked any details of the severe abuse and abject poverty Sowell experienced as a child, or any \"graphic descriptions\" of the atmosphere of violence that permeated his formative years. <i>See id.</i> at 398, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145122\"><a href=\"/opinion/145122/williams-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1495</span></a></span>. In contrast, Sowell's family members offered first-hand, eyewitness accounts of specific examples of extreme poverty and abuse. These specifics had far more evidentiary power than the abstractions and oblique references contained in the experts' written reports.</p>\n<p>What is more, the experts themselves never heard any of these details when they conducted their evaluations. Drs. Schmidtgoessling, Titchener, and Cooper interviewed only Sowell and had no contact with his family members. Only the social <span class=\"star-pagination\">*796</span> worker who compiled information for Dr. Walters' pretrial examination had any contact with Sowell's family, and she spoke only with Sowell's fathera source who had good reason to withhold the most compelling examples of abuse Sowell and his siblings endured as children. The reports of Drs. Titchener and Walters were not prepared for mitigation purposes, and there is nothing in Dr. Cooper's report about Sowell's background. These experts were appointed to evaluate Sowell's competence to stand trial and his mental capacity for purposes of exploring an insanity defense, and to the extent their reports discuss Sowell's background at all, they are drawn from an even narrower set of sources than those available to defense counsel.</p>\n<p>The subject matter of the additional mitigating evidence is different as well. The good deeds Sowell had done as an adult provide an incomplete picture of his moral worth. Sowell's actions as an adultgood and badare merely a snapshot in time, unilluminated by the longitudinal perspective that his developmental history provides. \"[E]vidence about the defendant's background and character is relevant because of the belief, long held by this society, that defendants who commit criminal acts that are attributable to a disadvantaged background . . . may be less culpable.\" <i>Penry v. Lynaugh,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112325\"><a href=\"/opinion/112325/penry-v-lynaugh/\"><span class=\"volume\">492</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">302</span></a></span>, 319, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112325\"><a href=\"/opinion/112325/penry-v-lynaugh/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Moreover, Sowell's good deeds might have been written off as isolated incidents or attributed to ulterior motives by a sentencing judge disinclined to see Sowell as a basically good person. But the additional mitigating evidence is of more than a few scattered incidents. It is evidence of a lifetime of privation and abuse, beginning in early childhood and continuing throughout the formative years of Sowell's life.</p>\n<p>The evidence the panel did not hearspecific details about Sowell's horrific childhoodis often the kind of evidence that undermines a court's confidence in the outcome of a capital sentencing proceeding. In <i>Williams,</i> 529 U.S. at 395, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145122\"><a href=\"/opinion/145122/williams-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1495</span></a></span>, the Supreme Court found prejudice where counsel failed to present evidence that Williams had a \"nightmarish\" childhood, that his \"parents were imprisoned for the criminal neglect\" of their children, and that Williams \"had been severely and repeatedly beaten by his father.\" Similarly in <i>Wiggins,</i> 539 U.S. at 535, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130159\"><a href=\"/opinion/130159/wiggins-v-smith-warden/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2527</span></a></span>, the Court found prejudice where counsel failed to discover \"powerful\" evidence of \"severe privation and abuse in the first six years of [Wiggins'] life while in the custody of his alcoholic, absentee mother,\" as well as evidence of \"physical torment, sexual molestation, and repeated rape during his subsequent years in foster care.\" Again in <i>Rompilla v. Beard,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"799980\"><a href=\"/opinion/799980/rompilla-v-beard/\"><span class=\"volume\">545</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">374</span></a></span>, 392-93, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"799980\"><a href=\"/opinion/799980/rompilla-v-beard/\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">360</span></a></span> (2005), the Court found prejudice where counsel failed to present evidence that Rompilla was reared in abject poverty and suffered extreme physical and psychological abuse, which included being \"locked . . . [with] his brother Richard in a small wire mesh dog pen that was filthy and excrement filled.\" And in <i>Porter,</i> 130 S.Ct. at 449, the Court found prejudicial counsel's failure to present evidence of Porter's \"abusive childhood\" and \"horrible family life,\" including an incident in which \"Porter's father shot at him for coming home late, but missed and just beat Porter instead,\" and another in which Porter's mother was beaten \"so severely that she had to go to the hospital and lost a child.\" Most recently in <i>Sears,</i> 130 S.Ct. at 3262, the Court found prejudicial counsel's failure to present evidence that Sears' home life was \"physically abusive\" and that he \"suffered sexual abuse at the hands of an adolescent male cousin.\"</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*797</span> A finding that Sowell was prejudiced by his attorneys' failure to develop and present exactly this kind of mitigating evidence is therefore squarely in line with the Supreme Court decisions addressing ineffective assistance during the penalty phase of a capital trial. Our court has also repeatedly found that ignorance of specifics about a defendant's formative years undermines confidence in the outcome of a capital sentencing proceeding. Most recently in <i>Goodwin,</i> 632 F.3d at 329, we deemed prejudicial counsel's failure to present evidence that Goodwin suffered \"severe privation and abuse in the early years of his life and while in the custody of his alcoholic and drug using mother,\" including evidence that he was \"frequently beaten, sexually molested, and abandoned by both of his parents.\" Likewise in <i>Mason v. Mitchell,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1212584\"><a href=\"/opinion/1212584/mason-v-mitchell/\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">766</span></a></span>, 780 (6th Cir.2008), this court held that the petitioner was prejudiced where counsel did not present evidence of Mason's \"abusive and unhealthy\" childhood, including evidence that his parents were \"daily drug users as well as traffickers,\" that his mother \"shot at his father because of his involvement with prostitution,\" and that Mason's parents \"regularly abused Mason and isolated all of their children from anyone not associated with the parents' drug dealing activities.\" And in <i>Harries,</i> 417 F.3d at 639, we upheld the district court's finding of prejudice where counsel failed to discover evidence that Harries suffered \"significant physical abuse\" during his \"traumatic\" childhood, including an incident in which he was \"hit . . . on the head with a frying pan,\" and another in which he was \"choked so severely that his eyes hemorrhaged.\"</p>\n<p>In short, like the additional mitigating evidence presented in these cases, evidence of Sowell's severely impoverished and abusive childhood is not merely cumulative of that presented at sentencing. This is also not a case in which the omitted evidence \"would have triggered admission of . . . powerful [aggravating] evidence in rebuttal.\" <i>Wong v. Belmontes,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1757\"><a href=\"/opinion/1757/wong-v-belmontes/\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">383</span></a></span>, 387-88, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1757\"><a href=\"/opinion/1757/wong-v-belmontes/\"><span class=\"volume\">175</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">328</span></a></span> (2009) (per curiam). In <i>Belmontes,</i> defense counsel \"built his mitigation strategy around the overriding need to exclude\" evidence that Belmontes had committed a prior murder. <i>Id.</i> at 385. The Supreme Court held that counsel's decision not to use expert testimony to \"humanize\" Belmontes was not prejudicial, because the expert testimony would have opened the door to evidence of the prior murder kept out only by counsel's vigilance. <i>Id.</i> at 388; <i>see also </i><i>Wood,</i> 130 S.Ct. at 850 n. 3. Here, the panel already knew the most damaging information about Sowell's background from the PSI and psychological reports, and additional mitigating evidence could only have tipped the balance in favor of leniency.</p>\n<p>We recognize that the prejudice question in this case is close, and that the Ohio courts had a different view of the impact defense counsel's performance had on Sowell's sentencing proceeding. However, under the pre-AEDPA standard that applies to this case, the federal courts must make their \"own independent determination of [Sowell's] federal claim,\" and are not bound by the state courts' view. <i>Wainwright,</i> 433 U.S. at 87, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109717\"><a href=\"/opinion/109717/wainwright-v-sykes/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2497</span></a></span>. For these reasons, the district court properly found that there is a reasonable probability that a three-judge panel presented with evidence of Sowell's extensive abuse and neglect would have returned a different sentence.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, Sowell is entitled to relief on his claim that trial counsel provided ineffective assistance during the penalty phase of his capital trial. Because counsel's failure to investigate compelling mitigating evidence constitutes ineffective assistance warranting resentencing, it is not <span class=\"star-pagination\">*798</span> necessary to address the other sentencing issues raised in the habeas petition concerning the imposition of the death penalty, including whether counsel's failure to obtain \"reasonable and necessary\" experts constitutes ineffective assistance, whether the three-judge panel erred in applying the wrong weighing standard during sentencing, and whether the presiding judge's ex parte communication with the probation department rendered the death sentence constitutionally infirm.<sup>[1]</sup> We now turn to issues raised by Sowell concerning the guilt phase of his trial.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>A. Prosecution's Suppression of Exculpatory Evidence</i></h2>\n<p>Sowell claims that the prosecution failed to disclose material exculpatory evidence, as required by <i>Brady v. Maryland,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106598\"><a href=\"/opinion/106598/brady-v-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">373</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106598\"><a href=\"/opinion/106598/brady-v-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">215</span></a></span> (1963). This claim is without merit for the reasons given by the district court. <i>Sowell,</i> 557 F.Supp.2d at 907-09. Sowell argues that prosecutors suppressed the statement of Jerrell Perrin, an eyewitness who lived on the same floor of the apartment building as Sowell and Graham. But Perrin's statement is not material and does not create sufficient doubt as to Sowell's guilt.</p>\n<p>In her affidavit filed in the post-conviction proceeding, Perrin testified that on the night of the shooting, she saw Sowell standing outside Graham's apartment and heard him ask Pamela Billups to return his money, and that she heard Billups respond by screaming profanities at Sowell. She testified that between twenty and thirty minutes later, she heard what she thought was a car backfiring. When she opened her door, she saw Sowell walking back to his apartment. Perrin testified that she knew Billups was a prostitute and had a reputation for dishonesty, and that Billups was known for stealing money from her customers.</p>\n<p>As the district court explained:</p>\n<blockquote>Perrin's affidavit actually contradicts petitioner's trial testimony, and the defense theory of the case, in several key respects. Petitioner testified that he did not argue with Billups about his money, yet Perrin's statement quite clearly states that she heard petitioner and Billups arguing. More importantly, Perrin's affidavit states that she heard the sounds of gunfire twenty to thirty minutes after the argument. This statement directly contradicts petitioner's testimony that the shooting happened \"far less than five minutes\" after he left the apartment, and calls into question the defense theory that this offense was committed without sufficient time to form the intent necessary for prior calculation and design.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Sowell,</i> 557 F.Supp.2d at 908-09. There is therefore not a \"reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different,\" <i>Strickler v. Greene,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118307\"><a href=\"/opinion/118307/strickler-v-greene/\"><span class=\"volume\">527</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">263</span></a></span>, 280, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118307\"><a href=\"/opinion/118307/strickler-v-greene/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">286</span></a></span> (1999), and Sowell's <i>Brady</i> claim therefore fails.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>B. Sufficiency of the Evidence of Aggravated Murder</i></h2>\n<p>Sowell next argues that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction. He is wrong. Sowell was convicted of aggravated murder, which requires a finding of prior calculation and design. <i>See</i> O.R.C. § 2903.03(A)(1). We adopt the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*799</span> careful reasoning of the district court to the effect that the evidence presented at trial was sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Sowell acted with prior calculation and design. Most pointedly, the district court explained that:</p>\n<blockquote>[T]he shootings did not occur as a result of an instantaneous eruption or one continuous course of events. There was an initial encounter and an exchange of hostile words between petitioner and Billups that generated a decision on petitioner's part to shoot and kill Billups. After arguing with Billups about whether she had taken his money, petitioner announced his intention to get his gun and kill Billups, and he put into action a plan to achieve that result. To that end, petitioner left Graham's apartment, went down the hall to his own apartment, and retrieved his gun. Although the period of time that elapsed between the initial encounter and the shootings was brief, there was a break in the encounter, or an intervening period, during which there was a time for reflection and planning. During that time, petitioner retrieved his weapon from a different location and devised a plan to regain entry to Graham's apartment under false pretenses by using Lenora Waugh. Accordingly, . . . there was sufficient time, under all of the circumstances, for petitioner to plan the killing.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Sowell,</i> 557 F.Supp.2d at 917.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>C. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel During the Guilt Phase</i></h2>\n<p>Finally, Sowell asserts that he received ineffective assistance of counsel during the guilt phase of his trial for four reasons. First, Sowell argues that counsel failed to conduct a reasonable pretrial investigation by not interviewing the state's witnesses. Second, Sowell argues that counsel failed to call Sowell's neighbor, Jerrell Perrin, as a defense witness. Third, Sowell argues that counsel failed to cross-examine Donna Edwards, a key prosecution witness and eyewitness to the shootings. And fourth, Sowell claims that counsel failed to object to inadmissible evidence concerning Sowell's children, a false ceiling in his apartment, and his prior contacts with law enforcement. With respect to each of these arguments, counsel's performance was not deficient, or if it was, Sowell has not shown that the deficiency affected the outcome of his trial.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Counsel's failure to conduct a reasonable investigation</h2>\n<p>Sowell first argues that his attorneys did not conduct a sufficient pretrial investigation because they failed to interview the state's witnesses. Again, we adopt the reasoning of the district court, which carefully disposed of this argument, relying in part on the fact that:</p>\n<blockquote>[T]he record reflects that counsel filed for discovery and for a more definite bill of particulars, met with petitioner to discuss his options with respect to the trier of fact, and reviewed the grand jury testimony of at least four witnesses. During a pre-trial hearing, petitioner's counsel stated on the record that they had met with the prosecutor and reviewed the evidence and photographs. Counsel filed several pre-trial motions, including a motion to suppress the gun found in petitioner's apartment. Moreover, as the trial court noted, petitioner failed to present any evidence during his post-conviction proceedings suggesting that his counsel did not have copies of the witness statements to police.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Sowell,</i> 557 F.Supp.2d at 883 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p>Sowell cites the Seventh Circuit's holding in <i>Stanley v. Bartley,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">465</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">810</span></span>, 813 (7th Cir.2006), for the proposition that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*800</span> these activities were not enough. But unlike the defendant in <i>Stanley,</i> Sowell was not prejudiced by his attorneys' failure to interview the state's witnesses because he has shown no real way in which their testimony would indicate his innocence. In <i>Stanley,</i> the state's key witness, James Dean, who might well have been the murderer, testified that he was with Stanley on the night of the murder and that he saw Stanley shoot the victim in the back. <i>Id.</i> at 811. But other witnesseswho did not testify and whom defense counsel did not interviewtold the police that Dean and the victim had been involved in a violent quarrel hours before the shooting. <i>Id.</i> at 812. Here, Sowell admitted shooting Graham and Billups, and the only issue to be decided by the panel was whether Sowell had committed the acts with prior calculation and design. Sowell has presented no evidence that would undermine confidence in the panel's finding of prior calculation and design. Thus, no prejudice has been shown from counsel's performance in this regard.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Counsel's failure to call Jerrell Perrin</h2>\n<p>Sowell next argues that counsel failed to call Sowell's neighbor Perrin as a defense witness. The district court rejected this argument for the same reason it found that Perrin's statement was not material exculpatory evidencei.e., \"the Perrin affidavit supports, in many respects, the state's theory of the case, and contradicts petitioner's account of the events.\" <i>Sowell,</i> 557 F.Supp.2d at 884. The court therefore properly concluded that \"the testimony of Perrin . . . would not have affected the outcome of petitioner's trial.\" <i>Id.</i> at 885.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. Counsel's failure to cross-examine Donna Edwards</h2>\n<p>The district court's opinion also properly disposes of Sowell's argument that trial counsel performed deficiently by failing to cross-examine Donna Edwards, a key prosecution witness and eyewitness to the shooting. Sowell maintains that the testimony of Edwardsthe only individual present in the apartment who was not shot by Sowellwas inconsistent in several respects with Billups's testimony, and that counsel should have brought out these inconsistencies on cross-examination. But once again, Sowell has not established that he was prejudiced by counsel's failure to do this.</p>\n<p>With respect to counsel's performance, the district court explained:</p>\n<blockquote>Although Edwards was a witness to the actual shooting, she had little to offer regarding petitioner's interaction with Billups in the days immediately preceding the shooting. Billups, on the other hand, was subject to lengthy cross-examination by counsel, as counsel attempted to establish that the shootings \"were prefaced by a heated, passionate, and emotional exchange between Mr. Sowell and Ms. Billups.\" Petitioner's case was not won or lost by whether counsel could exonerate him as the shooter; rather, counsel's theory of the case was that petitioner did not act with prior calculation and design, and \"[t]he disputed issue centered on what precipitated the shooting.\" To that end, counsel delivered an opening statement setting forth a cohesive defense, cross-examined Billups regarding the alleged theft that was at the center of the dispute, and called petitioner to testify regarding the events in question, his relationship with Billups in the days leading up to the shooting, and his mental state at the time of the offense.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Sowell,</i> 557 F.Supp.2d at 886-87 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*801</span> The district court also properly reasoned that there was no prejudice in this regard:</p>\n<blockquote>Even if counsel would have highlighted the inconsistencies between Edwards' testimony and that of Billups, those inconsistencies concerned somewhat collateral matters. What remains consistent with respect to the testimony of the two women is that petitioner threatened to shoot Billups, left the apartment to retrieve a gun from his own apartment down the hall, enlisted the assistance of Lenora Waugh to regain entry into the apartment, entered the apartment with force, shot Graham twiceincluding a fatal close range shot to his head, then went to where Billups was hiding in a closet and fired three shots into her body at close range, stopping only when he ran out of ammunition. With respect to these essential facts, the testimony of Edwards and Billups was consistent, and petitioner cannot meet the prejudice prong of <i>Strickland.</i>\n</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 887.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>4. Counsel's failure to object to inadmissible evidence</h2>\n<p>Finally, Sowell argues that trial counsel's performance was deficient because counsel failed to object to inadmissible evidence. Sowell claims that counsel failed to object to questions by the prosecutor during Sowell's cross-examination concerning whether he conceived children out of wedlock, whether he had a false ceiling in his apartment, and whether he had prior contacts with the Cincinnati Police Department. The district court properly held that these claims were procedurally defaulted because they were never presented to the state courts. <i>Sowell,</i> 557 F.Supp.2d at 888. The state maintains that position on appeal, and Sowell does not respond to the procedural default argument.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV.</h2>\n<p>For these reasons, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p>ALICE M. BATCHELDER, Chief Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p>I agree that the district court did not err in denying habeas relief on nearly all of Sowell's claims. However, I must respectfully dissent from the portion of the majority opinion affirming the grant of habeas relief on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel at the penalty phase. On the record before us, we cannot say either that counsel failed to investigate sufficiently, or that counsel pursued a constitutionally deficient mitigation strategy. Sowell has presented fourteen affidavits of family and friends, setting forth testimony about his childhood, his family dynamics, his work history, and his adult life. However, only one of those affidavitsthat of Sowell's fatheris of any help to Sowell's case, and even then, only marginally so.</p>\n<p>Sowell's argument is that counsel did not adequately investigate and therefore could not have made a strategic decision to omit certain mitigating evidence at the sentencing phase. In these types of cases, it is obviously not enough to merely present an affidavit containing testimony that was not introduced during the penalty phase. The testimony must also be useful. <i>See </i><i>Brooks v. Bagley,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1271284\"><a href=\"/opinion/1271284/brooks-v-bagley/\"><span class=\"volume\">513</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">618</span></a></span>, 630 (6th Cir.2008) (rejecting probative value of affidavit that did not specify what new information witnesses would have provided); <i>Martin v.

The affidavit must state that the affiant would have been willing to testify, because otherwise the trial court would never hear the relevant testimony. <i>See </i><i>Turner v. Romanowski,</i> 409 Fed.Appx. 922, 929 (6th Cir.2011) (\"Turner has not produced an affidavit from Ms. Matthews herself indicating that she would be willing to testify on Turner's behalf. . . .\"); <i>Coe v.

And to show that counsel conducted an inadequate investigation, the affidavit must at least state that counsel never spoke with the affiant. <i>Cf. </i><i>Goodwin v. Johnson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"183324\"><a href=\"/opinion/183324/goodwin-v-johnson/\"><span class=\"volume\">632</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">301</span></a></span>, 324 (6th Cir.2011) (\"The rest of Goodwin's familyincluding his mother, his sister, his neighbor, his friend, and the mother of his childtestified that at no time during the trial did attorneys or investigators try to contact them or ask them to testify on Goodwin's behalf.\"); <i>Morales v.

Without the affiant's stating that he had not been contacted by counsel, we have no way of knowing if the absence of the testimony was the product of an informed strategic decision by counsel or the result of deficient performance.</p>\n<p>The majority opinion glosses over the characteristics of each individual affidavit, describing them collectively with broad, summary language: \"Affidavits of fourteen family members and friends accompanied Sowell's state post-conviction petition, recounting the violence and privation of Sowell's childhood. Many of these witnesses stated that they would have been available and willing to testify at the penalty phase but had not been asked to do so.\" In fact, only eight of the affidavits have anything to say about Sowell's childhood. Of those, only one offers any helpful testimony and states that counsel never contacted the affiant.</p>\n<p>In order to avoid the majority's error, I will examine the affidavits individually, not as an indistinguishable mass of potential mitigation testimony. Sowell submitted several affidavits from immediate family members: Henderson Sowell, Sr. (father); Henderson Sowell, Jr. (brother); Larry Sowell (brother); and Catherine Jones (sister). He submitted affidavits from his wife and other family members: Lenora Waugh (common law wife); Bobby Lee Horton (great uncle); Helen Sanderful (aunt); Ann Simpson (aunt). He submitted an affidavit from a childhood friend: Kenneth Starks. Lastly, he submitted affidavits from friends and acquaintances from his adult life: Adam Huntley (employer); Leroy Jones (friend); Jerrell Perrin (neighbor); Jimmy Wilcox (co-worker); and Walter Gabennesh (employer). In all, Sowell submitted fourteen affidavits' worth of information that counsel was allegedly ineffective for failing to discover. However, very little of it goes towards establishing ineffective assistance of counsel, some of it is not helpful for mitigation, and some of it undercuts his mitigation case.</p>\n<p>The only argument Sowell advances, and the only one that has ever gained traction in a federal court, is that counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate and present evidence concerning Sowell's difficult childhood. Therefore, any testimony presented in the fourteen affidavits regarding Sowell's adult life is not relevant to Sowell's claim. Sowell never argues to the contrary. Waugh, Huntley, Leroy Jones, Perrin, Wilcox, and Gabennesh <span class=\"star-pagination\">*803</span> knew Sowell only in his adult life, and their testimony does not shed light on anything new from his childhood, so those affidavits are not valuable.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>Of the remaining eight affiants, the only ones to actually state that Sowell's attorneys never contacted them are his father, Henderson Sowell, Sr., and his aunt, Ann Simpson. None of the others state that counsel never spoke with them.<sup>[2]</sup> In light of this, the majority opinion's statement that, \"[C]ounsel did not interview any of Sowell's family members, including his father, brothers, sisters, and other relatives,\" is quite an overstatement.</p>\n<p>Because the affidavits of the six other relevant affiants are silent on the matter, we cannot assume that trial counsel never spoke with them. This is simply a matter of recognizing where the burden of proof lieswith Sowell, the petitioner. <i>See </i><i>Strickland v. Washington,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span>, 687, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The silence of the relevant affidavits on whether or not counsel ever spoke to the affiants cannot lead us to assume away Sowell's burden of proof. Furthermore, counsel's performance is entitled to \"a strong presumption that [it] falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\" <i>Strickland,</i> 466 U.S. at 689, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2052</span></a></span>. Because of this presumption, the burden of proof is heavy. <i>See </i><i>Short v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"796262\"><a href=\"/opinion/796262/ricky-wayne-short-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">471</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">686</span></a></span>, 692 (6th Cir.2006) (\"[D]efendants alleging ineffective assistance of counsel bear `a heavy burden of proof.'\" (quoting <i>Whiting v.

This presumption means nothing if we automatically assume that counsel did not speak to valuable witnesses, absent evidence to the contrary. Indeed, that would be a presumption that counsel did not perform adequately.</p>\n<p>That is especially the case here where we have no testimony, no affidavits, and no records whatsoever from the witnesses best able to speak on the extent of counsel's investigation: trial counsel themselves.<sup>[3]</sup><i>See </i><i>Carter v. Mitchell,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"793892\"><a href=\"/opinion/793892/clarence-carter-v-betty-mitchell-warden/\"><span class=\"volume\">443</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">517</span></a></span>, 531 (6th Cir.2006) (\"[C]uriously absent from the record is any statement from trial counsel describing what he did or did not do in investigating [petitioner's] background. By not detailing trial counsel's efforts to learn of [petitioner's] background, [petitioner] has provided no basis for a finding that trial counsel's investigation was unreasonable.\"). True, that is not always required. <i>See Woodard v. Mitchell,</i> 410 Fed.Appx. 869, 875 (6th Cir.2010). But it is \"obvious . . . that [trial counsel's] testimony, when available, is preferred.\" <i>Id.</i> This Court has never held that a petitioner can establish ineffective assistance by omitting all direct evidence of counsel's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*804</span> investigation and presenting affidavits from persons who may or may not have been contacted by counsel, setting out their potential testimony that counsel may or may not have known. To allow that is to do away with both the presumption that counsel performed adequately and the petitioner's burden of proof.</p>\n<p>The Court's holding today provides a roadmap to future habeas petitioners seeking to show ineffective assistance of counsel due to inadequate mitigation investigation. First, the petitioner should present no evidence regarding trial counsel's investigation. Next, he should submit affidavits from people setting forth any evidence that counsel did not introduce at trial, regardless of whether or not counsel was aware of it, regardless of whether or not counsel spoke with the affiants. Lastly, he must make sure the affiants do not mention whether or not counsel ever spoke to them during the mitigation investigation, or whether or not they were willing to testify at trial. It is that easy. Even if counsel did speak with the affiants but chose not to call them as witnesses, the affiants don't even have to lie about itthey just have to remain silent on the matter.</p>\n<p>I now return to the only two possibly relevant affidavits. Sowell's aunt, Ann Simpson, would not have provided useful testimony. She stated in her affidavit that, \"Billy Joe was a happy go lucky youth. He was always clean and liked to dress in nice clothing.\" Also undercutting the image of a chaotic and abusive relationship between his parents, she stated, \"Henderson and his wife, Mary Jane, appeared to get along okay.\"</p>\n<p>This leaves Sowell's father, Henderson Sowell, Sr., as the only relevant person for whom we have <i>any</i> evidence to say that Sowell's counsel never contacted him. The testimony the father presents in his affidavit is relatively unremarkable. Most of it concerns Henderson, Sr.'s own life and upbringing. It mentions Henderson's alcohol use, separation of the family, and the family's impoverished housing conditions. It does not contain any of the startling and vivid stories from Sowell's childhood: an infant sibling dying of starvation, rats biting the children, the father's abandonment of the children, the father's beating Billy Joe until a neighbor intervened, the father's sexual molestation of Catherine, and the father's threatening to burn Catherine to death. Those statements are from either Sowell himself (in his post-sentence interview with Dr. Hawgood) or his siblings. Even given Henderson, Sr.'s statement that, \"In 1983, I was not contacted by Billy Joe's attorneys or their assistants,\" the testimony he would have offered to them was of minimal value.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, assuming that trial counsel had all of the proffered evidence in front of him, I cannot say that their decision not to put forth testimony about Sowell's childhood was not the product of a strategic decision. I agree with the majority that the two strategies of emphasizing Sowell's deprived childhood and emphasizing his good character in his adult life are not necessarily incompatible. But as the affidavits submitted by family members make clear, the testimony about his miserable childhood would also include testimony that could harm Sowell's mitigation case. Each affidavit that included evidence about Sowell's difficult childhood also mentioned his temper and his violent tendencies. While his difficult childhood would probably paint a more sympathetic picture of Sowell, it would also paint a picture of a man inclined towards violence. The mitigation testimony of Sowell's friends that counsel did present painted a picture of a kind, generous man, with no mention whatsoever of Sowell's violent tendencies. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*805</span> True, the psychological reports mentioned Sowell's violent tendencies. But it could certainly have been a strategic decision by counsel to have friends give positive testimony about Sowell's character, while reserving any analysis of his violent tendencies to the expert witnesses. This would emphasize that his violent outburst that resulted in these crimes, while predictable to the experts in psychology and psychiatry, was surprising and out of character to those who knew Sowell best. Pursuing an additional strategy that focused on his difficult upbringing would not be inconsistent, but in this case it would be at great cost because it would bring to light his violent tendencies even more.</p>\n<p>The majority dismisses this concern by employing a double standard. The majority minimizes the damaging effect of the testimony about Sowell's violent tendencies by assuring itself that the psychological reports available to the court at sentencing already \"thoroughly documented Sowell's short temper and his propensity for responding violently to perceived injustices, especially when drinking.\" Similarly, the psychological reports briefly documented Sowell's difficult upbringing.<sup>[4]</sup> Of course, on these matters, the majority states that testimony from family members would be far more vivid and effective at describing Sowell's difficult childhood: \"These specifics had far more evidentiary power than the abstractions and oblique references contained in the experts' written reports.\" Why would specifics about his violent tendencies not also have \"more evidentiary power\"? Apparently, the advantage of specific first-hand testimony over psychological reports only works in Sowell's favor and never against it.</p>\n<p>I dissent from the majority opinion's affirmance of the district court's grant of relief because a careful examination of the evidence before us reveals that Sowell cannot show either that his counsel undertook an inadequate investigation or that counsel's choice of mitigation strategy was unreasonable. The majority can only find grounds for relief by failing to examine the affidavits individually, presuming them all to be unequivocally relevant and helpful to Sowell, and presuming that trial counsel did <i>not</i> perform an adequate investigation. As for Sowell's other arguments for relief that the district court rejected and the majority did not need to addressthat counsel should have objected to the presentence investigation report and should have obtained additional experts, challenging an ex parte communication between a trial judge and the probation department, and the trial court's weighing standard at sentencingI would deny relief on those claims for substantially the same reasons that the district court did.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  To the extent that this claim can be read as a challenge not only to Sowell's sentence but also to his conviction, we reject it for the reasons given by the district court. <i>Sowell,</i> 557 F.Supp.2d at 893-97.</p>\n<p>[1]  Furthermore, Waugh actually did testify at the sentencing phase.</p>\n<p>[2]  Even Larry Sowell, petitioner's brother, states only that he was not asked to testify. He does not say anything about whether or not counsel ever spoke with him.</p>\n<p>[3]  It is also particularly notable that two of these affiants are willing and able to say that they were never contacted by trial counsel and would have been willing to testify if asked, e.g., Henderson Sowell, Sr. Aff., some stated only that they would have been willing to testify, e.g., Larry Sowell Aff., and others say nothing at all on the matter, e.g., Catherine Jones Aff. The most logical interpretation of the affidavits is that, astoundingly, they each mean what they say and not what they do not say.</p>\n<p>[4]  \"He describes his father as having been a strict disciplinarian. . . . The family was very poor. . . .\" (Walters Report.) \"Mother had been good in some ways but a distant person and one who could not be satisfied with her marriage and family and frequently left it. . . .\" (Titchener Report.) \"[Sowell] feels that there was a lack of close parental nurturance, thus he felt he had a `rough' childhood. . . . [H]is early experiences left him feeling abandoned, angry, without significant stable relationships. . . .\" (Schmidtgoessling Report.)</p>\n\n</div>",
