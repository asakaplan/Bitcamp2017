MARTIN, JR., Circuit Judge. Robert M. Sills, a federal prisoner,\nappeals through counsel his 2009 conviction, following a jury trial, of conspiracy to\ndistribute five kilograms or more of cocaine, for which he was sentenced to 136 months\nof imprisonment. He argues on appeal that the evidence was insufficient to support his\nconviction, and that the prosecutor committed misconduct during closing argument in\nreferencing his failure to testify and improperly vouching for evidence submitted by the\nprosecution.\n\n\n\n                                           1\n\fNo. 10-1898         United States v. Sills                                           Page 2\n\n\n        Sills was charged with being a member of the “Black Mafia Family,” a\nnationwide drug conspiracy headquartered in Detroit. The evidence at trial included\ntestimony from four co-defendants who had entered guilty pleas and agreed to testify in\nhopes of receiving lighter sentences. These witnesses testified that they had driven\nvehicles with secret compartments filled with cocaine to St. Louis on numerous\noccasions. The witnesses would turn the vehicles over to Sills, who would remove the\ncocaine, fill the secret compartments with cash, and return the vehicles to the witnesses.\nIn support of this testimony, the government also introduced a ledger seized from one\nof the drug houses purporting to show a nickname by which Sills was known in the\nconspiracy appearing in several places, next to numbers indicating drug quantities and\nmoney. The government also introduced recordings of telephone calls between the\nconspirators mentioning the nickname by which Sills was known.\n\n        In reviewing a claim of insufficient evidence, we review the evidence in the light\nmost favorable to the prosecution, and determine whether “any rational trier of fact could\nhave found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.” Jackson v.\nVirginia, 443 U.S. 307, 319 (1979) (citing Johnson v. Louisiana, 406 U.S. 356, 362\n(1972)). Sills argues that the evidence showed only that he purchased drugs from\nmembers of the conspiracy on numerous occasions, and not that he joined the\nconspiracy. While he acknowledges that case law from this circuit holds that a\nconspiracy can be inferred from repeated purchases of large quantities of drugs, see\nUnited States v. Caver, 470 F.3d 220, 233 (6th Cir. 2006), and that it can be assumed\nthat participants understand that they are participating in a joint enterprise because their\nsuccess is dependent on the success of those from whom they buy drugs, see United\nStates v. Spearman, 186 F.3d 743, 746 (6th Cir. 1999), Sills argues that other circuits\nrequire more than a showing that the buyer intends to resell the drugs to establish that\nhe has joined a seller’s conspiracy. Sills cites United States v. Hawkins, 547 F.3d 66 (2d\nCir. 2008), but that case found a conspiracy had been proven based on the ongoing\nrelationship and trust between the buyer and seller. Id. at 75-76. In this case, the\nevidence showed that Sills had an ongoing relationship with the members of the\nconspiracy over several years, and that the members trusted Sills enough to turn over the\n\fNo. 10-1898         United States v. Sills                                          Page 3\n\n\nvehicles to him and instruct him how to open the secret compartments containing the\ndrugs. Therefore, we find the argument of insufficient evidence without merit.\n\n        During defense counsel’s closing argument, counsel argued that the jury could\nnot rely on the ledger to corroborate the testimony that Sills bought drugs from the\nconspiracy on numerous occasions because the person who wrote the ledger did not\ntestify. The prosecutor responded to this argument during closing as follows:\n\n        And I’m so glad that Mr. Richards brought up the point that you haven’t\n        heard from this person who wrote these ledgers and all of that. You\n        heard that there were over 66 people indicted in this district alone. You\n        heard from Agent Harvey that there were 16 people indicted in Atlanta\n        and that there were prosecutions in other districts in this country.\n        And just like Mr. Sills exercised his right to remain silent--and you are\n        by no means to judge him on that or read anything to that, you just look\n        at the evidence that has been presented by the government and hold\n        nothing against him for that--others are entitled to that same thing.\n\n        Sills argues that this argument was both an improper comment on his failure to\ntestify and improper vouching for the ledger evidence. Defense counsel did not object\nto the prosecutor’s argument, so it can be reviewed only for plain error. See United\nStates v. Emuegbunam, 268 F.3d 377, 406 (6th Cir. 2001). We will reverse a conviction\nbased on plain error only in exceptional circumstances that seriously affect the fairness\nof the trial. Id.\n\n        Allegations of prosecutorial misconduct, including comments on a defendant’s\nfailure to testify and improper vouching, are reviewed to determine whether the remarks\nwere improper, and, if so, whether they were flagrant. United States v. Galloway,\n316 F.3d 624, 632-33 (6th Cir. 2003). Here, the prosecutor commented on the\ndefendant’s failure to testify, but not in a way that would encourage the jury to infer\nguilt. Rather, the comment closely mirrors the instruction given to the jury by the judge.\nTherefore, even if it was improper, it was not flagrant. Similarly, the prosecutor’s\nexplanation for the lack of testimony by the author of the ledger, implying that he may\nhave invoked his Fifth Amendment rights, while arguably vouching for the materiality\nof the evidence, was not a flagrant misleading of the jury. Given the strength of the\n\fNo. 10-1898            United States v. Sills                                    Page 4\n\n\ngovernment’s case, both comments were at most harmless error. See id. They do not\ngive rise to the exceptional circumstances necessary to reverse a conviction on a ground\nnot raised at trial.\n\n        Accordingly, the district court’s judgment of conviction is affirmed.\n\f",
