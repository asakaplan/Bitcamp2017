Herbert Nixon sent six threatening letters to the\nfederal district judge who had sentenced him to prison for fraudulent use of an\nunauthorized credit card. The unsigned letters demanded money and threatened the\njudge’s life. One of them contained a white-powder substance, which was later\ndetermined to be a harmless artificial sweetener. Nixon pled guilty to committing a hoax\n\n\n        *\n           The Honorable John R. Adams, United States District Judge for the Northern District of Ohio,\nsitting by designation.\n\n\n                                                  1\n\fNo. 10-5929         United States v. Nixon                                           Page 2\n\n\ninvolving a biological weapon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1038(a)(1). The Sentencing\nGuidelines recommended a sentence of 30 to 37 months in prison. The district court\ndisagreed with that recommendation and sentenced Nixon to 60 months—the statutory\nmaximum—and also ordered that he have no contact with any member of the postal\nservice during his three years of supervised release. Nixon now challenges his sentence\nand the supervised release condition. The district court’s sentence was reasonable, so\nwe affirm.\n\n        Nixon first argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable. We review\nhis above-Guidelines sentence using a “deferential abuse-of-discretion standard.”\nUnited States v. Bolds, 511 F.3d 568, 578 (6th Cir. 2007) (quoting United States v. Gall,\n552 U.S. 38, 41 (2007)). A sentence may be substantively unreasonable where a district\ncourt selects it arbitrarily, fails to consider pertinent factors in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a), or\ngives unreasonable weight to any one factor. United States v. Denny, 653 F.3d 415, 424\n(6th Cir. 2011).\n\n        Here, the district court committed no error.            The court explained its\nsentence—including its decision to vary from the Guidelines—by discussing the serious\neffect of Nixon’s crime on the operation of government. See 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2)(A).\nNixon says that was an impermissible basis for varying upward because his Guidelines\nrange already included an enhancement for targeting a government officer. That a\ncircumstance was addressed in the Guidelines, however, does not prevent the district\ncourt from considering it under section 3553(a), so long as the court explains why the\ncircumstance warrants additional weight with regard to that particular defendant’s\nsentence. See United States v. Tristan-Madrigal, 601 F.3d 629, 635–36, 636 n.1 (6th\nCir. 2010) (refusing to find an above-Guidelines sentence to be substantively\nunreasonable where the Guidelines had already accounted for the district court’s\njustifications for that sentence). Moreover, Nixon’s offense involved more than just a\nsingle act against a government official—his white-powder hoax was part of a series of\nletters that threatened the life of a district judge and attempted to extort him.\n\fNo. 10-5929        United States v. Nixon                                           Page 3\n\n\n       The district court also explained that it varied above the Guidelines because\nNixon’s prior sentence of 36 months for credit card fraud had failed to deter him from\nfurther criminal conduct.      That too was a proper consideration under section\n3553(a)(2)(C). See Tristan-Madrigal, 601 F.3d at 633–34. That Nixon sent the\nthreatening letters out of anger over his fraud sentence makes no difference—the court\ndetermined that a sentence of more than 36 months was necessary to deter Nixon against\nfuture crimes.\n\n       Finally, Nixon says that by sentencing him at the top of the statutory range, the\ndistrict court left no room for higher penalties for more serious offenders. But Nixon’s\ncrimes were serious: they required the government to spend resources responding to a\nbio-hazard threat and were meant to terrorize a district judge and his staff. Moreover,\nthe court found that Nixon was a repeat offender and that the Guidelines’ criminal\nhistory calculation understated his criminal record. Those observations went to Nixon’s\nhistory and characteristics and were proper under section 3553(a)(1). See Tristan-\nMadrigal, 601 F.3d at 635–36.\n\n       That an appellate court might have imposed a different sentence is not an\nappropriate basis for reversal. Gall, 552 U.S. at 51; see also United States v. Collington,\n461 F.3d 805, 811 (6th Cir. 2006) (where the district court has considered the relevant\nsection 3553(a) factors in-depth, the appellate court should not substitute its judgment\nfor that of the district court regarding how long the defendant should serve). Given the\ncircumstances of Nixon’s offense, his criminal history, and his refusal to be deterred by\na prior 36-month sentence, the district court’s sentence of 60 months was not an abuse\nof discretion.\n\n       Nixon also challenges the supervised release condition barring him from contact\nwith any member of the postal service. Nixon did not object to this condition before the\ndistrict court, so we review it only for plain error. United States v. Kingsley, 241 F.3d\n828, 835 (6th Cir. 2001). A district court may impose a supervised release condition as\nlong as it is reasonably related to the factors in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B),\n(a)(2)(C), and (a)(2)(D); involves no greater deprivation of liberty than is reasonably\n\fNo. 10-5929        United States v. Nixon                                          Page 4\n\n\nnecessary for those factors; and is consistent with any pertinent policy statements of the\nSentencing Commission. See 18 U.S.C. § 3583(d).\n\n       Here, Nixon used the postal service to commit his crimes, so the supervised\nrelease condition was reasonably related to the “nature and circumstances of [his]\noffense.” 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(1); see also Kingsley, 241 F.3d at 838 (affirming a\nsupervised release condition restricting the driving privileges of a defendant because he\nhad used his vehicle to illegally transport firearms). The condition also serves to deter\nNixon against future criminal conduct, including retaliation against postal employees.\nSee United States v. Berridge, 74 F.3d 113, 119 (6th Cir. 1996) (affirming a condition\nprohibiting a defendant from obtaining employment in the banking industry, after he\npled guilty to making false statements on loan applications, in order to aid the defendant\nin avoiding the conditions that led him to commit the offense). Nixon has not identified\nany statements of the Sentencing Commission that are inconsistent with this condition.\nAnd that the condition arguably implicates Nixon’s First Amendment rights does not\ninvalidate it—we have approved supervised release conditions affecting constitutional\nrights so long as they were directly related to the defendant’s rehabilitation and the\nprotection of the public. See United States v. Ritter, 118 F.3d 502, 504–05 (6th Cir.\n1997) (rejecting a First Amendment challenge to a condition ordering a defendant to\ndisclose his embezzlement crimes to his employer). Finally, the deprivation of Nixon’s\nliberty is not greater than necessary. Nixon is only prohibited from contacting members\nof the postal service; he is not barred from using the service altogether. There was no\nerror, plain or otherwise.\n\n       The district court’s sentence is affirmed.\n\f",

Kingsley,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*627</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"772254\"><a href=\"/opinion/772254/united-states-v-eric-william-kingsley/\"><span class=\"volume\">241</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">828</span></a></span>, 835 (6th Cir.2001). A district court may impose a supervised release condition as long as it is reasonably related to the factors in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), and (a)(2)(D); involves no greater deprivation of liberty than is reasonably necessary for those factors; and is consistent with any pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. § 3583(d).</p>\n<p>Here, Nixon used the postal service to commit his crimes, so the supervised release condition was reasonably related to the \"nature and circumstances of [his] offense.\" 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(1); <i>see also </i><i>Kingsley,</i> 241 F.3d at 838 (affirming a supervised release condition restricting the driving privileges of a defendant because he had used his vehicle to illegally transport firearms). The condition also serves to deter Nixon against future criminal conduct, including retaliation against postal employees. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Berridge,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"711074\"><a href=\"/opinion/711074/united-states-v-michael-l-berridge/\"><span class=\"volume\">74</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">113</span></a></span>, 119 (6th Cir.1996) (affirming a condition prohibiting a defendant from obtaining employment in the banking industry, after he pled guilty to making false statements on loan applications, in order to aid the defendant in avoiding the conditions that led him to commit the offense). Nixon has not identified any statements of the Sentencing Commission that are inconsistent with this condition. And that the condition arguably implicates Nixon's First Amendment rights does not invalidate it we have approved supervised release conditions affecting constitutional rights so long as they were directly related to the defendant's rehabilitation and the protection of the public. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Ritter,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"743526\"><a href=\"/opinion/743526/united-states-v-jay-daniel-ritter/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">502</span></a></span>, 504-05 (6th Cir.1997) (rejecting a First Amendment challenge to a condition ordering a defendant to disclose his embezzlement crimes to his employer). Finally, the deprivation of Nixon's liberty is not greater than necessary. Nixon is only prohibited from contacting members of the postal service; he is not barred from using the service altogether. There was no error, plain or otherwise.</p>\n<p>The district court's sentence is affirmed.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  The Honorable John R.
