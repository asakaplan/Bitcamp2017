Bolton appeals the seventy-two month prison sentence imposed\nfollowing his guilty-plea conviction for knowing possession of child pornography\ntransported via computer, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2252A(a)(5)(B) and (b)(2). The\nparties have waived oral argument, and this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument\nis not needed. Fed. R. App. P. 34(a).\n\n       At his guilty-plea hearing, Bolton agreed that the trial evidence would show that\nhis laptop computer contained child pornography, which Bolton had downloaded using\na peer-to-peer file-sharing program called Ares. In calculating Bolton’s imprisonment\nrange under the Sentencing Guidelines, the Probation Office recommended, among other\nguideline enhancements, a two-level increase pursuant to § 2G2.2(b)(3)(F) based on\nBolton’s “distribution” of the images through Ares. Most of Bolton’s sentencing hearing\nwas devoted to expert testimony addressed to Bolton’s objection to this enhancement;\nBolton contended that there was no evidence he intended to use Ares to distribute child\n\n\n                                           1\n\fNo. 10-6555        United States v. Bolton                                        Page 2\n\n\npornography. Following argument, the district court overruled Bolton’s objection. The\nseventy-two month sentence imposed by the court, however, was well below the\nguidelines imprisonment range of 108 to 120 months. The court also sentenced Bolton\nto eight years of supervised release.\n\n       In this timely appeal, Bolton challenges the procedural reasonableness of his\nsentence, arguing that the district court misapplied USSG § 2G2.2(b)(3)(F) in imposing\nthe two-level enhancement, insofar as the evidence was inadequate to show that he\nintended to distribute child pornography via Ares, the peer-to-peer program.\n\n       We review a sentence imposed by a district court for reasonableness. United\nStates v. Lanning, 633 F.3d 469, 473 (6th Cir. 2011). Reasonableness review has both\na procedural and a substantive component. See Gall v. United States, 552 U.S. 38, 51\n(2007); Lanning, 633 F.3d at 473. When reviewing a district court’s sentencing\ndetermination for procedural reasonableness, we must “ensure that the district court\ncommitted no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly\ncalculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to\nconsider the [18 U.S.C.] § 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly\nerroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence.” Gall, 552 U.S.\nat 51 (emphasis added). Bolton does not explicitly challenge the substantive\nreasonableness of his sentence.\n\n       In arguing that the sentencing evidence was inadequate to prove that he intended\nto distribute child pornography under § 2G2.2(b)(3)(F), Bolton asserts that the district\ncourt concluded that his use of a file-sharing program was sufficient by itself to prove\ndistribution. He contends that most courts that have addressed this matter have required\nthat the government independently prove that the distribution was intentional or at least\nknowing.\n\n       The government responds that § 2G2.2(b)(3)(F) has no intent, knowledge, or any\nother mens rea requirement. The government stresses that some other subsections in\n§ 2G2.2(b)(3) do include intent requirements, indicating that the Sentencing Commission\n“knew how to require a mens rea for a specific offense characteristic to apply.” The\n\fNo. 10-6555        United States v. Bolton                                             Page 3\n\n\ngovernment maintains that, in any event, it proved Bolton’s intent to distribute by a\npreponderance of the evidence, based on the “multiple . . . advisories that Ares was a file\nsharing program” and evidence showing that Bolton knew about file-sharing programs\nbased on his installation of Ares on his own laptop and his removal of another file-\nsharing program, Limewire, from his girlfriend’s laptop, after her daughter had installed\nit.\n\n       Section 2G2.2(b)(3) provides for a range of guideline enhancements for\ndistribution of child pornography, such as for distribution for pecuniary gain or\ndistribution to a minor. See, e.g., § 2G2.2(b)(3)(A), (C). Section 2G2.2(b)(3)(F)\nrequires a two-level increase for “[d]istribution other than distribution described in\nsubdivisions (A) through (E).” The guideline defines “distribution” as follows:\n\n       “Distribution” means any act, including possession with intent to\n       distribute, production, transmission, advertisement, and transportation,\n       related to the transfer of material involving the sexual exploitation of a\n       minor. Accordingly, distribution includes posting material involving the\n       sexual exploitation of a minor on a website for public viewing but does\n       not include the mere solicitation of such material by a defendant.\n\n§ 2G2.2, cmt. n.1 (emphasis added). We review the district court’s application of the\nSentencing Guidelines de novo and its findings of fact for clear error. United States v.\nDeitz, 577 F.3d 672, 698 (6th Cir. 2009).\n\n       The district court’s explanation for overruling Bolton’s objection to the two-level\nenhancement was as follows:\n\n       Well, you know, I think that there was a time, perhaps, of several years\n       ago when I could say that – and I think I have said in cases that – that just\n       simply having a peer-to-peer file sharing program on your computer\n       didn’t mean that you were intending to distribute, but I think that time\n       has passed. I really do.\n       I think that nowadays everybody knows that that’s what these things are\n       about. I think that there was evidence Mr. Bolton was familiar with\n       LimeShare [sic] and he got LimeShare off the daughter’s [sic] computer\n       or something and used Ares instead. I think that people nowadays know\n       that if they have these programs, they’re sharing, even though it’s\n       difficult and you have to go through all the steps. It’s just like Facebook.\n\fNo. 10-6555        United States v. Bolton                                          Page 4\n\n\n       You’ve got to do a lot of things to, you know, to be secure. When you\n       don’t do that, you’re making all of your files, you’re sharing your files.\n\nWe agree with Bolton that this explanation suggests that the court believed that Bolton’s\nuse of a file-sharing program, standing alone, was adequate to support the distribution\nenhancement. However, the court’s explanatory comments concerning Bolton’s removal\nof a different file-sharing program from his girlfriend’s computer and replacement of it\nwith Ares also reflected a determination that Bolton knew how the programs worked.\nThe girlfriend, Karen Wallace, in fact testified that Bolton was aware that the programs\n“shared files.”\n\n       We have not explicitly addressed § 2G2.2(b)(3)(F)’s applicability in a decision\ninvolving a conviction of possession of child pornography, and have done so only in two\nunpublished decisions in appeals from convictions for distribution of child pornography.\nSee United States v. Pizzino, 419 F. App’x 579, 582 (6th Cir. 2011); United States v.\nDarway, 255 F. App’x 68, 70 (6th Cir. 2007). Emphasizing that the defendant in\nDarway had already pleaded guilty to distribution, we rejected Darway’s appeal of a\n§ 2G2.2(b)(3)(F) increase, noting that “[s]everal courts have held that maintaining files\nin an accessible public folder constitutes distribution.” Darway, 255 F. App’x at 71-72\n(citing cases). In Pizzino, we noted that the defendant had admitted that he acted\n“intentionally.” Pizzino, 419 F. App’x at 582.\n\n       At least two circuits appear to hold that the government may prove distribution\nmerely by showing that the defendant knowingly used a peer-to-peer file-sharing\nprogram to download child pornography. See United States v. Layton, 564 F.3d 330, 335\n(4th Cir. 2009) (possession conviction); United States v. Carani, 492 F.3d 867, 876 (7th\nCir. 2007) (possession and receiving convictions). Under this standard, the sentencing-\nhearing evidence was more than adequate to establish that Bolton knowingly used Ares\nto “distribute” child pornography.\n\n       Bolton relies heavily on an Eighth Circuit decision, United States v. Durham, 618\nF.3d 921 (8th Cir. 2010), and other Eighth Circuit decisions, for the proposition that the\n“mere use of a peer-to-peer file-sharing network such as Ares . . . does not automatically\n\fNo. 10-6555         United States v. Bolton                                         Page 5\n\n\ntrigger application of § 2G2.2(b)(3)(F)’s distribution enhancement.” The Eighth\nCircuit’s jurisprudence in this area, which the court in Durham discussed at length, is\nsomewhat more nuanced than Bolton suggests. It is true that the Durham court noted\nthat it had repeatedly held that its cases did not call for automatic application of the\n§ 2G2.2(b)(3)(F) enhancement whenever a defendant used a file-sharing program to\ndownload child pornography. See Durham, 618 F.3d at 925-26, 931 (citing United\nStates v. Stults, 575 F.3d 834, 848 (8th Cir. 2009), and United States v. Ultsch, 578 F.3d\n827, 829-30 (8th Cir. 2009)). Instead, application of the distribution enhancement must\nbe decided on a “case-by-case basis.” Id. at 926 (citing Ultsch). The Durham court\nobserved that the Eighth Circuit had “significantly altered” its approach in United States\nv. Dodd, 598 F.3d 449 (8th Cir. 2010), cert. denied, 130 S. Ct. 3533 (2010), while\nacknowledging that the inquiry was still “fact-intensive.” Durham, 618 F.3d at 926-27\n(citing Dodd, 598 F.3d at 451). The Dodd court changed the approach by “impos[ing]\na new standard whereby the file-sharing defendant must show ‘concrete evidence of\nignorance–evidence that is needed because ignorance is entirely counterintuitive’”\nwhere a file-sharing program is involved. Id. at 927 (quoting Dodd, 598 F.3d at 452)\n(emphasis added).\n\n       The court in Durham sustained the defendant’s challenge to a § 2G2.2(b)(3)(F)\nincrease, noting that the defendant’s brother testified that he, not Durham, had installed\nLimewire on Durham’s computer and that Durham was not knowledgeable about the\nprogram. Id. at 923, 928-29. In addressing Durham’s contentions, the Eighth Circuit\nultimately concluded that “our case law inquires whether the defendant’s ‘use of the\npeer-to-peer file sharing network made the child-pornography files in his shared folder\navailable to be searched and downloaded by other . . . users.’” Id. at 928 (quoting\nUnited States v. Estey, 595 F.3d 836, 843 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 130 S. Ct. 3342 (2010))\n(emphasis in original).\n\n       In Bolton’s case, in contrast, Bolton’s girlfriend testified that Bolton not only\ninstalled Ares on his own laptop but removed a different file-sharing program from her\nlaptop and replaced it with Ares. She also testified that Bolton understood that Ares\n\fNo. 10-6555          United States v. Bolton                                      Page 6\n\n\n“shared files” with other users.      We conclude that this evidence is adequate to\ndistinguish Bolton’s case from Durham. It at least arguably refutes any claim by Bolton\nthat he was ignorant of the fact that his use of a file-sharing program made the files he\ndownloaded through the program “available” to be searched and downloaded by others.\nSee id. at 928; United States v. DuFran, 430 F. App’x 855, 857 (11th Cir. 2011).\nAccordingly, we conclude that Bolton cannot prevail under the Eighth Circuit standard,\neither.\n\n          For the reasons discussed above, we affirm Bolton’s conviction and sentence.\n\n                                               ENTERED BY ORDER OF THE COURT\n\n\n\n                                                      /s/ Leonard Green\n                                               ___________________________________\n                                                              Clerk\n\f",

The <i>Dodd</i> court changed the approach by \"impos[ing] a new standard whereby the file-sharing defendant must show `concrete evidence of <i>ignorance</i>evidence that is needed because ignorance is entirely counterintuitive'\" where a file-sharing program is involved. <i>Id.</i> at 927 (quoting <i>Dodd,</i> 598 F.3d at 452) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>The court in <i>Durham</i> sustained the defendant's challenge to a § 2G2.2(b)(3)(F) increase, noting that the defendant's brother testified that he, not Durham, had installed Limewire on Durham's computer and that Durham was not knowledgeable about the program. <i>Id.</i> at 923, 928-29. In addressing Durham's contentions, the Eighth Circuit ultimately concluded that \"our case law inquires whether the defendant's `use of the peer-to-peer file sharing network made the child-pornography files in his shared folder <i>available</i> to be searched and downloaded by other . . . users.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 928 (quoting <i>United States v.

BOLTON, Defendant-Appellant.</h1></center>\n<center>No. 10-6555.</center>\n<center><p><b>United States Court of Appeals, Sixth Circuit.</b></p></center>\n<center>January 19, 2012.</center>\n<p>Before: KEITH, GUY, and GIBBONS, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>ORDER</h2>\n<p>Tommy K. Bolton appeals the seventy-two month prison sentence imposed following his guilty-plea conviction for knowing possession of child pornography transported via computer, in violation of 18 U.S.C. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*781</span> § 2252A(a)(5)(B) and (b)(2). The parties have waived oral argument, and this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p>At his guilty-plea hearing, Bolton agreed that the trial evidence would show that his laptop computer contained child pornography, which Bolton had downloaded using a peer-to-peer file-sharing program called Ares. In calculating Bolton's imprisonment range under the Sentencing Guidelines, the Probation Office recommended, among other guideline enhancements, a two-level increase pursuant to § 2G2.2(b)(3)(F) based on Bolton's \"distribution\" of the images through Ares. Most of Bolton's sentencing hearing was devoted to expert testimony addressed to Bolton's objection to this enhancement; Bolton contended that there was no evidence he <i>intended</i> to use Ares to distribute child pornography. Following argument, the district court overruled Bolton's objection. The seventy-two month sentence imposed by the court, however, was well below the guidelines imprisonment range of 108 to 120 months. The court also sentenced Bolton to eight years of supervised release.</p>\n<p>In this timely appeal, Bolton challenges the procedural reasonableness of his sentence, arguing that the district court misapplied USSG § 2G2.2(b)(3)(F) in imposing the two-level enhancement, insofar as the evidence was inadequate to show that he intended to distribute child pornography via Ares, the peer-to-peer program.</p>\n<p>We review a sentence imposed by a district court for reasonableness. <i>United States v. Lanning,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"184114\"><a href=\"/opinion/184114/united-states-v-lanning/\"><span class=\"volume\">633</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">469</span></a></span>, 473 (6th Cir.2011). Reasonableness review has both a procedural and a substantive component. <i>See </i><i>Gall v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145843\"><a href=\"/opinion/145843/gall-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">552</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">38</span></a></span>, 51, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145843\"><a href=\"/opinion/145843/gall-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">586</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145843\"><a href=\"/opinion/145843/gall-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">169</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">445</span></a></span> (2007); <i>Lanning,</i> 633 F.3d at 473. When reviewing a district court's sentencing determination for procedural reasonableness, we must \"ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or <i>improperly calculating</i>) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the [18 U.S.C.] § 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence.\" <i>Gall,</i> 552 U.S. at 51, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145843\"><a href=\"/opinion/145843/gall-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">586</span></a></span> (emphasis added). Bolton does not explicitly challenge the substantive reasonableness of his sentence.</p>\n<p>In arguing that the sentencing evidence was inadequate to prove that he intended to distribute child pornography under § 2G2.2(b)(3)(F), Bolton asserts that the district court concluded that his use of a file-sharing program was sufficient by itself to prove distribution. He contends that most courts that have addressed this matter have required that the government independently prove that the distribution was intentional or at least knowing.</p>\n<p>The government responds that § 2G2.2(b)(3)(F) has no intent, knowledge, or any other mens rea requirement. The government stresses that some other subsections in § 2G2.2(b)(3) do include intent requirements, indicating that the Sentencing Commission \"knew how to require a mens rea for a specific offense characteristic to apply.\" The government maintains that, in any event, it proved Bolton's intent to distribute by a preponderance of the evidence, based on the \"multiple . . . advisories that Ares was a file sharing program\" and evidence showing that Bolton knew about file-sharing programs based on his installation of Ares on his own laptop and his removal of another file-sharing program, Limewire, from his girlfriend's laptop, after her daughter had installed it.</p>\n<p>Section 2G2.2(b)(3) provides for a range of guideline enhancements for distribution of child pornography, such as for distribution for pecuniary gain or distribution to a minor. <i>See, e.g.,</i> § 2G2.2(b)(3)(A), <span class=\"star-pagination\">*782</span> (C). Section 2G2.2(b)(3)(F) requires a two-level increase for \"[d]istribution other than distribution described in subdivisions (A) through (E).\" The guideline defines \"distribution\" as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Distribution\" means any act, including possession with intent to distribute, production, transmission, advertisement, and transportation, related to the transfer of material involving the sexual exploitation of a minor. Accordingly, distribution includes <i>posting material involving the sexual exploitation of a minor on a website for public viewing</i> but does not include the mere solicitation of such material by a defendant.</blockquote>\n<p>§ 2G2.2, cmt. n. 1 (emphasis added). We review the district court's application of the Sentencing Guidelines de novo and its findings of fact for clear error. <i>United States v. Deitz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1233878\"><a href=\"/opinion/1233878/united-states-v-deitz/\"><span class=\"volume\">577</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">672</span></a></span>, 698 (6th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p>The district court's explanation for overruling Bolton's objection to the two-level enhancement was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>Well, you know, I think that there was a time, perhaps, of several years ago when I could say thatand I think I have said in cases thatthat just simply having a peer-to-peer file sharing program on your computer didn't mean that you were intending to distribute, but I think that time has passed. I really do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>I think that nowadays everybody knows that that's what these things are about. I think that there was evidence Mr. Bolton was familiar with LimeShare [sic] and he got LimeShare off the daughter's [sic] computer or something and used Ares instead. I think that people nowadays know that if they have these programs, they're sharing, even though it's difficult and you have to go through all the steps. It's just like Facebook.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>You've got to do a lot of things to, you know, to be secure. When you don't do that, you're making all of your files, you're sharing your files.</blockquote>\n<p>We agree with Bolton that this explanation suggests that the court believed that Bolton's use of a file-sharing program, standing alone, was adequate to support the distribution enhancement. However, the court's explanatory comments concerning Bolton's removal of a different file-sharing program from his girlfriend's computer and replacement of it with Ares also reflected a determination that Bolton knew how the programs worked. The girlfriend, Karen Wallace, in fact testified that Bolton was aware that the programs \"shared files.\"</p>\n<p>We have not explicitly addressed § 2G2.2(b)(3)(F)'s applicability in a decision involving a conviction of <i>possession</i> of child pornography, and have done so only in two unpublished decisions in appeals from convictions for <i>distribution</i> of child pornography. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Pizzino,</i> 419 Fed.Appx. 579, 582 (6th Cir.2011); <i>United States v. Darway,</i> 255 Fed.Appx. 68, 70 (6th Cir.2007). Emphasizing that the defendant in <i>Darway</i> had already pleaded guilty to distribution, we rejected Darway's appeal of a § 2G2.2(b)(3)(F) increase, noting that \"[s]everal courts have held that maintaining files in an accessible public folder constitutes distribution.\" <i>Darway,</i> 255 Fed.Appx. at 71-72 (citing cases). In <i>Pizzino,</i> we noted that the defendant had admitted that he acted \"intentionally.\" <i>Pizzino,</i> 419 Fed.Appx. at 582.</p>\n<p>At least two circuits appear to hold that the government may prove distribution merely by showing that the defendant knowingly used a peer-to-peer file-sharing program to download child pornography. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Layton,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1028711\"><a href=\"/opinion/1028711/united-states-v-layton/\"><span class=\"volume\">564</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">330</span></a></span>, 335 (4th Cir.2009) (possession conviction); <i>United States v. Carani,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1447430\"><a href=\"/opinion/1447430/united-states-v-carani/\"><span class=\"volume\">492</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">867</span></a></span>, 876 (7th Cir.2007) (possession and receiving <span class=\"star-pagination\">*783</span> convictions). Under this standard, the sentencing-hearing evidence was more than adequate to establish that Bolton knowingly used Ares to \"distribute\" child pornography.</p>\n<p>Bolton relies heavily on an Eighth Circuit decision, <i>United States v. Durham,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"174090\"><a href=\"/opinion/174090/united-states-v-durham/\"><span class=\"volume\">618</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">921</span></a></span> (8th Cir.2010), and other Eighth Circuit decisions, for the proposition that the \"mere use of a peer-to-peer file-sharing network such as Ares . . . does <i>not</i> automatically trigger application of § 2G2.2(b)(3)(F)'s distribution enhancement.\" The Eighth Circuit's jurisprudence in this area, which the court in <i>Durham</i> discussed at length, is somewhat more nuanced than Bolton suggests. It is true that the <i>Durham</i> court noted that it had repeatedly held that its cases did <i>not</i> call for automatic application of the § 2G2.2(b)(3)(F) enhancement whenever a defendant used a file-sharing program to download child pornography. <i>See </i><i>Durham,</i> 618 F.3d at 925-26, 931 (citing <i>United States v. Stults,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1214508\"><a href=\"/opinion/1214508/united-states-v-stults/\"><span class=\"volume\">575</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">834</span></a></span>, 848 (8th Cir.2009), and <i>United States v. Ultsch,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1456432\"><a href=\"/opinion/1456432/united-states-v-ultsch/\"><span class=\"volume\">578</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">827</span></a></span>, 829-30 (8th Cir.2009)). Instead, application of the distribution enhancement must be decided on a \"case-by-case basis.\" <i>Id.</i> at 926 (citing <i>Ultsch</i>). The <i>Durham</i> court observed that the Eighth Circuit had \"significantly altered\" its approach in <i>United States v. Dodd,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1224909\"><a href=\"/opinion/1224909/united-states-v-dodd/\"><span class=\"volume\">598</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">449</span></a></span> (8th Cir.2010), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The <i>Dodd</i> court changed the approach by \"impos[ing] a new standard whereby the file-sharing defendant must show `concrete evidence of <i>ignorance</i>evidence that is needed because ignorance is entirely counterintuitive'\" where a file-sharing program is involved. <i>Id.</i> at 927 (quoting <i>Dodd,</i> 598 F.3d at 452) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>The court in <i>Durham</i> sustained the defendant's challenge to a § 2G2.2(b)(3)(F) increase, noting that the defendant's brother testified that he, not Durham, had installed Limewire on Durham's computer and that Durham was not knowledgeable about the program. <i>Id.</i> at 923, 928-29.
