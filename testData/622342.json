Plaintiffs-appellants Amanda and\nReece Heinrich and six other couples (referred to collectively as “plaintiffs”) appeal the\ndistrict court’s order granting the second motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by\ndefendants-appellees, Waiting Angels Adoption Services, Inc. and its principals, Simone\nBoraggina and Joseph Beauvais (referred to collectively as “defendants”). The district\ncourt dismissed with prejudice, pursuant to Rules 12(b)(6) and 9(b), all claims in the\nplaintiffs’ third amended complaint brought under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt\nOrganizations Act (“RICO”), 18 U.S.C. § 1962. On appeal, the plaintiffs argue (1) that\nthe district court failed to include several alleged predicate acts in its analysis of their\nRICO claim, (2) that the district court erred in ruling that the third amended complaint\ndid not adequately allege extortion, and (3) that the district court erred in concluding that\nthe allegations in the third amended complaint failed to meet the requirement of\ncontinuity, which is necessary to establish a pattern of racketeering activity and a\nsubstantive RICO violation. For the reasons that follow, we reverse.\n\n                                             I.\n\n        The plaintiffs are seven couples who enlisted the assistance of the Waiting\nAngels Adoption Services, Inc. (“Waiting Angels”) in an attempt to adopt children from\nGuatemala. Believing that they were defrauded in the course of their adoption efforts,\nthe plaintiffs initiated suit in federal district court on October 24, 2006, naming Waiting\nAngels and its two principals, Simone Boraggina and Joseph Beauvais, as defendants.\nThe original complaint was first amended on March 26, 2007. About a month later, the\ncase was stayed due to the pendency of state criminal proceedings against the individual\ndefendants. After the state criminal proceedings were resolved, the district court granted\nthe plaintiffs’ motion to lift the stay on April 2008 and granted them permission to file\na second amended complaint.\n\fNo. 09-2470         Heinrich, et al. v. Waiting Angels                               Page 3\n                    Adoption Services, et al.\n\n\n        In response, the defendants filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings,\npursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(c) and 9(b), which the district court\ngranted. Some claims were dismissed with prejudice, but the plaintiffs were granted\nleave to amend and replead certain claims, including: (1) a RICO claim under section\n1962(c) alleging Waiting Angels Adoption Services, Inc. as the enterprise and Boraggina\nand Beauvais as individual defendants, with the plaintiffs allowed to allege as predicate\nacts violations of federal mail fraud, wire fraud, and extortion statutes as well as\nviolations of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2314 and 1952; (2) a RICO claim under section 1962(d) for\nconspiracy between Boraggina and Beauvais only, including the predicate acts identified\nabove; and (3) various state law claims that are not at issue in this appeal.\n\n        The plaintiffs filed their third amended complaint on April 4, 2009. Counts 1\nthrough 6 assert state law claims. Count 7 alleges violations of the mail and wire fraud\nstatutes, 18 U.S.C. §§ 1341 and 1343, for the purpose of establishing the predicate acts\nof racketeering activity needed to support the RICO claims that follow. Count 8 asserts\na claim that the individual defendants, Boraggina and Beauvais, committed a substantive\nRICO violation under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). It alleges that Waiting Angels constituted\nan “enterprise” within the meaning of the statute and that the individual defendants\nconducted the affairs of this enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity,\nparticularly through extortion and fraud. Finally, Count 9 asserts a RICO conspiracy\nclaim between Boraggina and Beauvais under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d).\n\n        The third amended complaint contains the following allegations that are\nparticularly relevant to this appeal. First, as a general matter, the plaintiffs allege that\nthe defendants advertised Waiting Angels’s services on the internet and that the\ndefendants’ website displayed children that were advertised as available for adoption.\nThe plaintiffs also allege that Waiting Angels was advertised as a non-profit\norganization, when, in reality, it was a for-profit organization.\n\fNo. 09-2470           Heinrich, et al. v. Waiting Angels                          Page 4\n                      Adoption Services, et al.\n\n\nPlaintiffs Heinrich\n\n       The Heinriches allege that on June 13, 2005, they were sent an email by the\ndefendants containing baby pictures and that they decided to attempt to adopt baby\nSelvin, a baby pictured in the email and apparently available for adoption. They signed\na contract with Waiting Angels and wired $12,000 for a “referral” or match. About a\nmonth earlier, they had been told by Boraggina that “[once] the dossier is certified, the\nadoption will be completed in 4-6 months.” On January 30, 2006, Boraggina informed\nthe Heinriches that the birth mother had not signed the necessary papers and the adoption\ncould not proceed without this documentation.\n\nPlaintiffs Kruger and Flenniken (“Flenniken plaintiffs”)\n\n       The Flenniken plaintiffs allege that in January 2006, they received an invoice for\nfoster care fees for $1050 for baby Maria, the child they hoped to adopt. In mid-March\n2006, they traveled to Guatemala and discovered that baby Maria remained in an\norphanage and had never lived in foster care. Beauvais then sent the Flenniken plaintiffs\nan email demanding that they pay the rest of the adoption fees, and they responded that,\nunder the adoption contract, the fees were not due until the case was out of PGN (the\nGuatemalan family court), and they would not pay until that time. The couple alleges\nthat in response the defendants sent a request to the Guatemalan attorney to stop the\nadoption until they were sent a certified check.\n\n       The Flenniken plaintiffs further allege that due to their frustration with Waiting\nAngels and the individual defendants, they hired a different adoption agency to complete\ntheir adoption.\n\nPlaintiffs Casassa\n\n       The Casassas allege that they were matched with Guatemalan twins by the\ndefendants around January 28, 2006, after which they signed an adoption agreement and\nwired money for adoption fees and foster fees. On May 24, 2006, Boraggina emailed\nto advise them that the twins had been reclaimed by their birth mother. They assert that\n\fNo. 09-2470        Heinrich, et al. v. Waiting Angels                              Page 5\n                   Adoption Services, et al.\n\n\nthe twins had not been reclaimed by their birth mother but instead were already matched\nwith another family through a different adoption agency. They allege that Boraggina\nhad knowledge of this fact at the end of January 2006, when Waiting Angels collected\nfees for the adoption. They support this allegation by asserting further: (1) during the\nfour months they were “matched” with the twins, the defendants sent no photos or\nmedical information; (2) the U.S. Embassy in Guatemala had no record of a pending\nadoption case involving the Casassas; (3) the defendants did not respond to demands for\nproof that the plaintiffs’ money had been sent to Guatemala; and (4) the twins had not\nbeen reclaimed by their birth mother but were matched with another adoptive family\nthrough a different adoption agency.\n\n       The Casassas also allege that on June 26, 2006, they contacted the defendants for\nan update and to inquire about the photos of new babies and toddlers being offered for\nadoption on the Waiting Angels website. The defendants informed the Casassas that the\ncouple was not sent any referrals because the children pictured on the website were\nbeing handled by a Guatemalan attorney other than the attorney handling the twins’\nadoption. The couple further alleges that they were later told that the defendants could\nnot get birth certificates for the babies they were displaying on the website.\n\nPlaintiffs Tavolilla\n\n       The Tavolillas allege that they were considering baby Marvin for adoption and\nwere sent his medical information by the defendants in May 2006. They were unsure\nof whether to begin the adoption process when they received a telephone call from\nBoraggina on May 25, 2006, advising them they needed to wire the money immediately\nto start the adoption process for baby Marvin because “He’s gonna go, He’s gonna go,\nHe’s gonna go!!” Shortly after wiring $16,000 to the defendants, the Tavolillas received\na call from their pediatrician who determined that the child had serious health issues and\nadvised them not to adopt the child. The Tavolillas allege that they were assured by\nBoraggina that if the child was not healthy, the adoption fee would be returned. When\nthey made this refund request, however, Boraggina responded by saying that Beauvais\n\fNo. 09-2470         Heinrich, et al. v. Waiting Angels                              Page 6\n                    Adoption Services, et al.\n\n\nwas responsible for such financial matters, that he was unavailable for a few days, and\nthat she thought the money had already been sent to an attorney in Guatemala.\n\nPlaintiffs Lundy\n\n       The Lundys allege that after two other unsuccessful adoption attempts in which\nthe couple paid a total of $26,550 in fees, they emailed the defendants on July 13, 2006\nto inquire about another baby featured on the Waiting Angels website. In a reply email,\nBoraggina informed the Lundys that the baby about whom they inquired was\n“unavailable to them because she was with a different attorney.”\n\nPlaintiffs Wright\n\n       The Wrights allege that in September 2005, they sent Waiting Angels $14,350\nfor the retainer fee and adoption payment for the adoption of baby Wendy, after which\nthey were faxed an adoption agreement. The complaint does not contain any further\ndetails about the terms of this agreement for baby Wendy.\n\n       On January 2, 2006, the Wrights decided to adopt another child, baby Estafany,\nand sent the defendants another $14,350 to begin the adoption process. The contract for\nbaby Estafany required them to pay $350 per month to the defendants to “offset private\nfoster care fees for the child.” The Wrights allege they learned through an investigator\nthat the Guatemalan Adoption Agency and foster mother “never received the $350 per\nmonth that they were being charged by the Defendants.”\n\nPlaintiffs Saenz\n\n       The Saenz plaintiffs allege that on February 2, 2006, they wired $8,500 to the\ndefendants for payment of “in country” fees, which they were told would be sent to the\nfacilitators in Guatemala for the adoption of baby Maria. They were also charged $350\nper month for foster fees. On May 14, 2007, the Saenz plaintffs discovered that the\ndefendants had not paid the facilitator any money for the adoption and that the foster fees\nremained unpaid.\n\fNo. 09-2470         Heinrich, et al. v. Waiting Angels                                Page 7\n                    Adoption Services, et al.\n\n\n        In response to this third amended complaint, the defendants filed a second motion\nfor judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Rules 9(b) and 12(c) on May 15, 2009. After\na hearing, the district court granted the defendants’ motion, issuing an opinion in which\nit dismissed the federal claims with prejudice and the state law claims without prejudice.\nHeinrich v. Waiting Angels Adoption Services, Inc., No. 5:06-cv-168, 2009 WL\n3401171, at *20 (W.D. Mich. Oct. 19, 2009). Assessing the allegations that formed the\nbasis for the RICO claims under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), the district court found that the\ncomplaint did not allege sufficient facts that could give rise to a plausible claim of\nextortion. The district court also concluded that there were only four plausible claims\nof mail or wire fraud, spanning the period between September 2005 to February 2006.\nThe court went on to conclude that these four plausible claims were insufficient to show\neither a “closed-ended” or “open-ended” pattern of racketeering, and thus the plaintiffs\nwere unable to establish a substantive violation of the RICO statute. Finally, the court\nfound that the plaintiffs’ RICO conspiracy claim could not stand because they were\nunable to plausibly allege an underlying RICO violation.\n\n                                             II.\n\n        We review the district court’s dismissal of a complaint pursuant to a Rule 12(c)\nmotion de novo. Rawe v. Liberty Mut. Fire Ins. Co., 462 F.3d 521, 526 (6th Cir. 2006).\n“The manner of review under Rule 12(c) is the same as a review under Rule 12(b)(6)\n. . . .” Vickers v. Fairfield Med. Ctr., 453 F.3d 757, 761 (6th Cir. 2006).\n\n        In assessing a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), this court construes the\ncomplaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, accepts the plaintiff’s factual\nallegations as true, and determines whether the complaint “contain[s] sufficient factual\nmatter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.” Ashcroft\nv. Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 1949 (2009) (internal quotation and citation omitted); Inge v.\nRock Fin. Corp., 281 F.3d 613, 619 (6th Cir. 2002). A plaintiff’s complaint must\nprovide “more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements\nof a cause of action will not do.” Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007).\n\fNo. 09-2470         Heinrich, et al. v. Waiting Angels                                Page 8\n                    Adoption Services, et al.\n\n\nCourts are not required to accept as true legal conclusions couched as factual allegations.\nId. (quoting Papasan v. Allain, 478 U.S. 265, 286 (1986)). “Factual allegations must be\nenough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level . . . .” Id. “[O]nly a\ncomplaint that states a plausible claim for relief survives a motion to dismiss. . . .\n[W]here the well-pleaded facts do not permit the court to infer more than the mere\npossibility of misconduct, the complaint has alleged—but it has not ‘show[n]’—‘that the\npleader is entitled to relief.’” Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. at 1950 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2))\n(internal citation omitted).\n\n        The plaintiffs must also meet the more rigorous pleading standards of Rule 9(b)\nwith respect to their claims based on fraud. Rule 9(b) states that “[i]n alleging fraud or\nmistake, a party must state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud or\nmistake.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b). In order to allege fraud with particularity, the plaintiffs,\nat a minimum, must “‘allege the time, place, and content of the alleged misrepresentation\non which [they] relied; the fraudulent scheme; the fraudulent intent of the defendants;\nand the injury resulting from the fraud.’” United States ex rel. Bledsoe v. Cmty. Health\nSys., Inc., 342 F.3d 634, 643 (6th Cir. 2003) (quoting Coffey v. Foamex L.P., 2 F.3d 157,\n161–62 (6th Cir. 1993)).\n\n        The plaintiffs challenge the dismissal of their RICO claim under 18 U.S.C.\n§ 1962(c), which provides:\n\n        It shall be unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any\n        enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or\n        foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the\n        conduct of such enterprise’s affairs through a pattern of racketeering\n        activity or collection of unlawful debt.\n\n18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). A violation of the statute requires “(1) conduct (2) of an enterprise\n(3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity.” Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co.,\n473 U.S. 479, 496 (1985). A plaintiff must allege each element to properly state a claim.\nThe plaintiffs challenge the district court’s findings that only four predicate acts of\nracketeering activity were adequately alleged in the third amended complaint and that\n\fNo. 09-2470         Heinrich, et al. v. Waiting Angels                               Page 9\n                    Adoption Services, et al.\n\n\nthese four predicate acts were insufficient to establish a pattern of racketeering activity.\nAs discussed below, we agree with the district court that the plaintiffs have only\nadequately pled four predicate acts of racketeering activity, but we find that these four\nacts are sufficient to establish a pattern of racketeering activity.\n\n                       A. Predicate Acts of Racketeering Activity\n\n        Racketeering activity consists of acts which are indictable under a number of\nfederal statutes listed in 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1)(B). In this case, the plaintiffs allege as\npredicate acts of racketeering activity: mail and wire fraud, 18 U.S.C. §§ 1341 and 1343;\nextortion in violation of the Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1951; transmitting or transferring\nin interstate commerce goods, wares, merchandise, or money knowing the same to have\nbeen stolen, converted, or taken by fraud, 18 U.S.C. § 2314; and traveling in interstate\nor foreign commerce with the intent to distribute the proceeds of extortion, 18 U.S.C.\n§ 1952.\n\n        On appeal, the plaintiffs argue that (1) the district court improperly ignored\nseveral predicate acts of mail and wire fraud committed by the defendants and (2) the\ndistrict court incorrectly ruled that the third amended complaint did not adequately allege\nany predicate acts of extortion. These arguments are without merit.\n\n                          1. Mail and Wire Fraud Allegations\n\n        Mail fraud consists of “(1) a scheme to defraud, and (2) use of the mails in\nfurtherance of the scheme.” United States v. Jamieson, 427 F.3d 394, 402 (6th Cir.\n2005). The elements of wire fraud are essentially the same except that one must use the\nwires in furtherance of the scheme to defraud. United States v. Daniel, 329 F.3d 480,\n486 n.1 (6th Cir. 2003) (noting that the statutes share the same relevant language and the\nsame analysis should be used for each). “A scheme to defraud includes any plan or\ncourse of action by which someone uses false, deceptive, or fraudulent pretenses,\nrepresentations, or promises to deprive someone else of money.” Jamieson, 427 F.3d\nat 402. A plaintiff must also demonstrate scienter to establish a scheme to defraud,\n\fNo. 09-2470        Heinrich, et al. v. Waiting Angels                             Page 10\n                   Adoption Services, et al.\n\n\nwhich is satisfied by showing the defendant acted either with a specific intent to defraud\nor with recklessness with respect to potentially misleading information. United States\nv. DeSantis, 134 F.3d 760, 764 (6th Cir. 1998).\n\n       When pleading predicate acts of mail or wire fraud, in order to satisfy the\nheightened pleading requirements of Rule 9(b), a plaintiff must “(1) specify the\nstatements that the plaintiff contends were fraudulent, (2) identify the speaker, (3) state\nwhere and when the statements were made, and (4) explain why the statements were\nfraudulent.” Frank v. Dana Corp., 547 F.3d 564, 570 (6th Cir. 2008) (quoting Gupta v.\nTerra Nitrogen Corp., 10 F. Supp. 2d 879, 883 (N.D. Ohio 1998)). A RICO plaintiff is\nnot required to plead or prove first-party reliance on an allegedly false statement. See\nBridge v. Phoenix Bond & Indem. Co. 553 U.S. 639, 648 (2008). To allege a valid\nRICO claim, however, a plaintiff must show not only that the predicate act was a “but\nfor” cause of plaintiff’s injuries, but also that it was a proximate cause. Holmes v. Sec.\nInvestor Prot. Corp., 503 U.S. 258, 268 (1992). A plaintiff must show “some direct\nrelation between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged.” Id.\n\n       First, plaintiffs argue that the district court erred in disregarding allegedly\nfraudulent emails sent by the defendants in May 2005. To support their claim, the\nplaintiffs point to documents gathered in the state criminal prosecution of Boraggina and\nBeauvais and included in the plaintiffs’ response to the second motion to dismiss. These\ndocuments reveal an incident where, in a request for references, Boraggina sent\nprospective clients, Jeff and Cheryl Smith, (who are not parties to this lawsuit) an email\ncontaining the names of purported former clients “Tony and Carol Vitale” and their\nemail address. This email address was actually owned and controlled by Beauvais. A\nfew days later, the Smiths received an email from “the Vitales” that gave Waiting Angels\na positive review. Plaintiff Amanda Heinrich also claims that when she was considering\ncontracting with Waiting Angels, she relied upon “positive references” which she\nreceived from an email address later discovered to be owned by the defendants. The\nplaintiffs argue that these fraudulent communications violate the wire fraud statute and\nshould be included as an additional predicate act.\n\fNo. 09-2470         Heinrich, et al. v. Waiting Angels                              Page 11\n                    Adoption Services, et al.\n\n\n        These allegations, however, were not included in the plaintiffs’ third amended\ncomplaint, and the plaintiffs never requested that the defendants’ motion for judgment\non the pleadings be converted into a motion for summary judgment. A district court\ngenerally may only consider matters outside the pleadings if they treat the motion “as\none for summary judgment under Rule 56.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(d). See Jones v. City of\nCincinnati, 521 F.3d 555, 562 (6th Cir. 2008). Because the district court did not convert\nthe defendants’ motion into a motion for summary judgment, it properly ruled on the\nmotion without considering these additional allegations of wire fraud. See Patterson v.\nNovartis Pharm. Corp., No. 10-5886, 2011 WL 3701884, at *3 (6th Cir. August 23,\n2011) (unpublished opinion).\n\n        Furthermore, even if the district court should have considered these additional\nallegations, the Heinrich plaintiffs have still failed to allege wire fraud with the required\nparticularity since Amanda Heinrich’s affidavit does not include the date she received\nthe allegedly fraudulent email from the defendants. The Heinriches have also failed to\nshow how the misrepresentation of the true author of these emails was a proximate cause\nof any injury to their business or property. Their alleged injuries are too attenuated from\nthe alleged fraud. Their argument appears to be that the positive references served as an\ninducement to do business with Waiting Angels. But any injuries they may have\nsuffered were not the direct result of the alleged fraudulent conduct. Rather, the false\nreferences helped put the Heinriches in a position to be defrauded by other, unrelated\nrepresentations concerning the availability of specific children or how adoption fees will\nbe spent. The false references, while perhaps a “but for” cause of the Heinriches’\ninjuries, did not proximately result in any harm to their business or property. Thus, the\nplaintiffs have not adequately alleged any additional predicate acts of wire fraud\nresulting from emails containing fraudulent positive references about Waiting Angels.\n\n        The plaintiffs also argue that the district court improperly failed to include claims\narising from alleged misrepresentations on the defendants’ website as predicate acts of\nracketeering activity. The plaintiffs claim that the defendants “frequently advertised\nchildren on their website who they knew, or should have known, were unavailable for\n\fNo. 09-2470        Heinrich, et al. v. Waiting Angels                             Page 12\n                   Adoption Services, et al.\n\n\nadoption.” They argue that the promise of ample children available for adoption induced\nthem to pay non-refundable fees to facilitate adoptions that the defendants knew would\nbe impossible to achieve. This argument is also without merit because the plaintiffs have\nnot adequately alleged that the person making these representations acted with\nknowledge or reckless disregard of their falsity.\n\n       “Rule 9(b) requires not only specifying the false statements and by whom they\nwere made but also identifying the basis for inferring scienter.” North Am. Catholic\nEduc. Programming Found., Inc. v. Cardinale, 567 F.3d 8, 13 (1st Cir. 2009). “The\ncourts have uniformly held inadequate a complaint's general averment of the defendant's\n‘knowledge’ of material falsity, unless the complaint also sets forth specific facts that\nmake it reasonable to believe that defendant knew that a statement was materially false\nor misleading.” Greenstone v. Cambex Corp., 975 F.2d 22, 25 (1st Cir.1992). While the\nplaintiffs have alleged in a general and conclusory fashion that the defendants knew that\nchildren they were advertising as available for adoption were not actually available, they\nhave failed to set forth specific facts that would support a reasonable inference that\n(1) the children were actually unavailable and (2) the defendants knew they were not\navailable.\n\n       For example, after an attempted adoption of a set of twins was unsuccessful, the\nCasassas alleged that they contacted the defendants and stated that the couple was\n“aware of many new baby and toddler photos being offered for adoption” on the Waiting\nAngels website. They alleged that defendants informed them that the couple was not\nsent any referrals because the children pictured on the website were being handled by\na different Guatemalan attorney than the attorney handling the twins’ adoptions. The\ncouple further alleged that they were told later that the defendants could not get birth\ncertificates for the babies they were displaying on the website.\n\n       The complaint does not specify who told the couple that the defendants could not\nget the birth certificates for the babies advertised on the website. More importantly, the\ncomplaint does not provide sufficient facts from which it would be reasonable to infer\n\fNo. 09-2470         Heinrich, et al. v. Waiting Angels                             Page 13\n                    Adoption Services, et al.\n\n\nthat the children advertised were actually unavailable. Merely labeling the defendants’\nresponses as “suspicious” does not suffice. Furthermore, the plaintiffs fail to allege any\nspecific facts that would allow us to infer that at the time the defendants advertised\nchildren as available on their website, they made this promise of availability with\nknowledge of its falsity.      These allegations raise only “the mere possibility of\nmisconduct” and do not show the plaintiffs’ entitlement to relief. Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. at\n1950.\n\n        In summary, the plaintiffs have failed to adequately allege any additional\npredicate acts of mail or wire fraud.\n\n                                 2. Extortion Allegations\n\n        The plaintiffs also argue that the district court incorrectly held that they had\nfailed to properly allege any instance of extortion in their third amended complaint. A\nplaintiff claiming a Hobbs Act violation of extortion as a predicate act in a civil RICO\nclaim must establish that the defendant “obstruct[ed], delay[ed], or affect[ed] commerce\nor the movement of any article or commodity in commerce, by … extortion or\nattempt[ed] or conspir[ed] so to do, or committ[ed] or threaten[ed] physical violence to\nany person or property in furtherance of a plan or purpose to do [so].” 18 U.S.C.\n§ 1951(a). Extortion is defined as “the obtaining of property from another, with his\nconsent, induced by wrongful use of actual or threatened force, violence, or fear, or\nunder color of official right.” 18 U.S.C. § 1951(b)(2).\n\n        The concept of extortion is not limited to fear of physical violence. Under the\n“fear of economic harm” theory, a private citizen can commit extortion by leading the\nvictim to believe that the perpetrator can exercise his or her power to the victim’s\neconomic detriment. See United States v. Kelly, 461 F.3d 817, 826 (6th Cir. 2006).\n“[T]he fear of economic harm may arise independently of any action by the defendant,\n. . . [i]t is enough if the fear exists and the defendant intentionally exploits it.” United\nStates v. Williams, 952 F.2d 1504, 1513–14 (6th Cir. 1991). The perpetrator’s threats or\nexploitation of a victim’s fear must also be “wrongful” to constitute extortion. 18 U.S.C.\n\fNo. 09-2470          Heinrich, et al. v. Waiting Angels                           Page 14\n                     Adoption Services, et al.\n\n\n§ 1951(b)(2). Thus, to properly claim acts of extortion in this case, the plaintiffs must\nallege facts and circumstances that show (1) that the defendants obtained the plaintiffs’\nproperty (2) through the wrongful use of (3) threats or fear of physical or economic\nharm.\n\n        The Flennikens allege they were victims of criminal extortion when the couple\nlearned that defendants Boraggina and Beauvais had requested that the Guatemalan\nattorney stop work on the adoption of the baby the couple was pursuing until the\nremainder of the adoption fees was paid. The plaintiffs labeled this conduct “emotional\nterrorism” but did not allege that they paid any money in response to this alleged threat.\nThis claim does not amount to actionable extortion because the plaintiffs do not allege\nthat the defendants “obtained property” as the result of this alleged threat. By statutory\ndefinition, extortion requires the victim to be deprived of property and the perpetrator\nto “obtain” that property. Scheidler v. NOW, Inc., 537 U.S. 393, 405 (2003). At most,\nthe Flennikens have alleged that the defendants threatened them with emotional distress,\nwhich is insufficient to support a claim of extortion.\n\n        The Tavollias also allege they were subject to extortion. Their claim centers\naround the allegation that while they were still considering adopting baby Marvin but\nbefore their physician had completed his review of his medical records, they were\ncontacted by defendant Boraggina. She advised them to begin the adoption process\nimmediately, before their physician completed his review of the baby’s health records,\nclaiming “He’s gonna go!” In response, the couple wired $16,000 to the defendants and\nbegan the adoption process, only to discover shortly thereafter that the baby suffered\nfrom serious health problems. These allegations show that Boraggina created a sense\nof urgency surrounding the start of the adoption process, but they do not establish that\nit was “wrongful.”\n\n        First, the Tavollias do not allege any additional facts or circumstances that would\nprovide grounds to conclude that this sense of urgency was not warranted—i.e., that\nthere was little chance that baby Marvin would soon become unavailable. So plaintiffs\n\fNo. 09-2470        Heinrich, et al. v. Waiting Angels                            Page 15\n                   Adoption Services, et al.\n\n\nhave not adequately alleged that this urgency was wrongful in the sense that it was false.\nMoreover, if we characterize the interaction between the plaintiffs and the defendants\nas a business transaction in which defendants are selling adoption services, the loss of\nthe chance to adopt baby Marvin would place the Tavollias in fear of an economic harm,\nwhich, if improperly exploited, could amount to extortion. See United States v. Collins,\n78 F.3d 1021, 1030–31 (6th Cir. 1996) (finding that the possibility of lost business\nopportunities is a type of economic fear within the scope of extortion). But this fear and\nany sense of urgency created by Boraggina was not wrongful in the sense that it was\nunreasonable or unfair under the circumstances. In the business context, Boraggina’s\nbehavior is best characterized as hard bargaining or a pressure sales tactic. See Mathon\nv. Feldstein, 303 F.Supp.2d 317, 325 (E.D.N.Y. 2004) (finding that “hard bargaining”\ndoes not constitute extortion).\n\n       On the other hand, if we consider the adoption process to be something other than\na business transaction, the Tavollias have not shown that they were placed in fear of an\neconomic harm. Now, the loss of the opportunity to adopt baby Marvin would not be\nconsidered a lost business opportunity. Instead, the sense of urgency would have placed\nthe Tavollias in fear of purely emotional harm—fear that they would regret missing the\nchance to adopt baby Marvin. The plaintiffs do not cite any case in which the concept\nof extortion includes the exploitation of the fear of purely emotional harm, such as the\ndistress one would likely experience if a hoped for adoption was lost. For these reasons,\nwe conclude the Tavollias have not adequately alleged facts that might give rise to a\nplausible claim of extortion.\n\n       The plaintiffs also claim that the defendants frequently advertised children on the\nWaiting Angels website who they knew or should have known were unavailable for\nadoption and that this conduct amounted to extortion. They argue that the defendants\n“would play upon people’s desire to adopt these children, wrongfully, to excise\nadditional adoption fees from them.” Setting aside the fact that this allegation was not\npled in their complaint, it also is without merit. The use of a website to advertise\nchildren as available for adoption, who are actually unavailable, does not constitute a\n\fNo. 09-2470            Heinrich, et al. v. Waiting Angels                                          Page 16\n                       Adoption Services, et al.\n\n\nthreat nor induce fear of economic, or even emotional harm. On the contrary, as the\nplaintiffs acknowledge, the sight of many children supposedly available for adoption on\nthe Waiting Angels website would inspire hope, not fear, that a couple would ultimately\nfind a child they could successfully adopt. The alleged unavailability of children on the\nWaiting Angels website is a claim that the defendants committed fraud—a claim\ndiscussed and dismissed earlier—not that they committed extortion. In summary, the\nplaintiffs have failed to adequately allege any predicate acts of extortion in violation of\nthe Hobbs Act in their third amended complaint.\n\n                                  3. Adequately Pled Allegations\n\n         The district court found that the complaint sufficiently alleged four predicate acts\nof mail or wire fraud: the Cassassas’ claim of fraudulent representations made about the\navailability of a pair of twins (January 2006), and the Flennikens’ (January 2006),\nSaenzs’ (February 2006), and Wrights’ (January 2006)1 claims of fraudulent inducement\nof the payment of foster care expenses. Heinrich, 2009 WL 3401171 at *14, *16. We\nagree that these four claims do adequately allege predicate acts of mail or wire fraud as\nthey have adequately alleged a scheme to defraud, the use of the mail or wires in\nfurtherance of the scheme, and a sufficient factual basis from which to infer scienter.\nSee Jamieson, 427 F.3d at 402; DeSantis, 134 F.3d at 764; Cardinale, 567 F.3d at 13.\n\n         The district court discussed and ultimately rejected many other claims of mail\nand wire fraud in its opinion, including claims by the Heinriches, Flennikens, Tavolillas,\nLundys, Wrights, and Saenzs of “promissory fraud” involving representations\nconcerning the defendants’ timeliness and ability to complete adoptions and claims\nbased on the alleged misrepresentation of Waiting Angels’s nonprofit status. The\nrejection of these claims was proper, since the plaintiffs have not alleged sufficient\ninformation to render their claims of fraud plausible, as opposed to merely possible.\n\n         1\n           The district court mistakenly stated that the date of the Wrights’ claim for fraudulent inducement\nof the payment of foster care expenses was September 2005. The Wrights allege that they entered into two\ncontracts and made payments to Waiting Angels for two different children, one in September 2005 and\none in January 2006. The claim involving foster care fees arose out the contract for baby Estafany, entered\ninto in January 2006.\n\fNo. 09-2470         Heinrich, et al. v. Waiting Angels                             Page 17\n                    Adoption Services, et al.\n\n\nIqbal, 129 S.Ct. at 1950. As discussed above, the plaintiffs have not adequately alleged\nany additional predicate acts of mail or wire fraud or of extortion.\n\n         Accordingly, the plaintiffs have adequately alleged four predicate acts of\nracketeering activity, spanning a two-month period from January 2006 through February\n2006. The question then arises whether these four acts, if proven, would be sufficient\nto establish a pattern of racketeering activity.\n\n                           B. Pattern of Racketeering Activity\n\n         To establish a substantive RICO violation, a plaintiff must show “a pattern of\nracketeering activity.” 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). A pattern of racketeering activity requires,\nat minimum, two acts of racketeering activity within ten years of each other. 18 U.S.C.\n§ 1961(5). While the statute defines the minimum number of acts necessary to establish\na pattern of racketeering activity, the Supreme Court has held that the minimum two acts\nare not necessarily sufficient. In order to show a “pattern” of racketeering activity, a\nplaintiff must show “that the racketeering predicates are related, and that they amount\nto or pose a threat of continued criminal activity.” H. J. Inc. v. Nw. Bell Tel. Co., 492\nU.S. 229, 237–39 (1989). This requirement has come to be called the “relationship plus\ncontinuity” test. See, e.g., Brown v. Cassens Transp. Co., 546 F.3d 347, 355 (6th Cir.\n2008).\n\n         The relationship prong of this test is satisfied by showing the predicate acts have\n“similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of commission, or otherwise\nare interrelated by distinguishing characteristics and are not isolated events.” H. J. Inc.,\n492 U.S. at 240. It has been satisfied in this case. The predicate acts were committed\nby the same participants, Beauvais and Borragina, for similar purposes with similar\nvictims using similar methods of commission. The individual defendants used email\ncorrespondence, telephone conversations, and a website connected to their Waiting\nAngels adoption agency to defraud hopeful adoptive parents out of adoption-related fees.\n\fNo. 09-2470          Heinrich, et al. v. Waiting Angels                           Page 18\n                     Adoption Services, et al.\n\n\n          The continuity prong of the test can be satisfied by showing either a “close-\nended” pattern (a series of related predicate acts extending over a substantial period of\ntime) or an “open-ended” pattern (a set of predicate acts that poses a threat of continuing\ncriminal conduct extending beyond the period in which the predicate acts were\nperformed). Id. at 241–42. The plaintiffs cannot establish close-ended continuity. “A\nparty alleging a RICO violation may demonstrate continuity over a closed period by\nproving a series of related predicates extending over a substantial period of time.\nPredicate acts extending over a few weeks or months . . . do not satisfy this [close-ended\ncontinuity] requirement. . . .” Id. at 242. (omitted text addresses the threat of future\ncriminal conduct, which is part of an open-ended continuity analysis). This court has\nfound that racketeering activity that spanned seventeen months did not constitute a\nsubstantial period of time. See Vemco, Inc. v. Camardella, 23 F.3d 129, 134 (6th Cir.\n1994) (finding that allegations of four predicate acts, affecting one victim and spanning\nseventeen months, were insufficient to meet the continuity requirement). In this case,\nthe predicate acts of racketeering activity spanned less than two months—January and\nFebruary 2006—and thus do not meet the requirements for close-ended continuity.\n\n          The plaintiffs can, however, establish open-ended continuity. “Often a RICO\naction will be brought before continuity can be established [by showing predicate acts\nspanning a substantial period of time]. In such cases, liability depends on whether the\nthreat of continuity is demonstrated.” H. J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 242. So the plaintiffs must\nplausibly allege that there was a threat of continuing criminal activity beyond the period\nduring which the predicate acts were performed. Determining whether the predicate acts\nestablish open-ended continuity requires a court to examine the specific facts of the case.\nId. The threat of continuing racketeering activity need not be established, however,\nexclusively by reference to the predicate acts alone; rather, a court should consider the\ntotality of the circumstances surrounding the commission of those acts. Brown, 546 F.3d\nat 355.\n\n          The defendants argue that because Waiting Angels was shut down as part of the\ncriminal prosecution of the individual defendants, the enterprise currently poses no threat\n\fNo. 09-2470         Heinrich, et al. v. Waiting Angels                             Page 19\n                    Adoption Services, et al.\n\n\nof facilitating continued criminal activity, and the plaintiffs, therefore, cannot establish\nopen-ended continuity. Subsequent events are irrelevant to the continuity determination,\nhowever, because “in the context of an open-ended period of racketeering activity, the\nthreat of continuity must be viewed at the time the racketeering activity occurred.”\nUnited States v. Busacca, 936 F.2d 232, 238 (6th Cir. 1991). “The lack of a threat of\ncontinuity of racketeering activity cannot be asserted merely by showing a fortuitous\ninterruption of that activity such as by an arrest, indictment or guilty verdict.” Id.; see\nalso Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Michigan v. Kamin, 876 F.2d 543, 545 (6th Cir. 1989)\n(finding that continuity was established because, if the defendant had not been caught,\nthere was no reason to believe he would not still be submitting fraudulent insurance\nclaims); Moon v. Harrison Piping Supply, 465 F.3d 719, 729 (6th Cir. 2006) (Moore, J.,\nconcurring) (stating that the court should not consider events that transpired after the\nalleged racketeering acts ended when determining whether a threat of long-term\nracketeering activity has been properly alleged).\n\n        Moreover, the complaint does not allege an inherently terminable scheme—a\npattern of racketeering activity with a built-in ending point—that has prevented this\ncourt from finding open-ended continuity in the past. Vemco, 23 F.3d at 134 (finding\nno open-ended continuity where only a single scheme to defraud one plaintiff the cost\nof one paint system was pled); Vild v. Visconsi, 956 F.2d 560, 569 (6th Cir. 1992)\n(finding the plaintiff had failed to plead open-ended continuity when “the acts alleged\namount[ed] at best to a breach of contract with a single customer”); Thompson v.\nPaasche, 950 F.2d 306, 311 (6th Cir. 1991) (finding that there was no open-ended\ncontinuity because the defendant’s fraudulent scheme to sell nineteen lots of land was\n“an inherently short-term affair” that would end once the lots were sold). Here, there is\nno inherent limit to the number of couples seeking to adopt or to the number of children\nthat the defendants could hold out as available for adoption.\n\n        At the time that the defendants committed the four predicate acts alleged here,\nthere was no indication that their pattern of behavior would not continue indefinitely into\nthe future. The plaintiffs have thus adequately alleged a threat of continuing criminal\n\fNo. 09-2470            Heinrich, et al. v. Waiting Angels                                          Page 20\n                       Adoption Services, et al.\n\n\nactivity and, therefore, have sufficiently alleged a pattern of racketeering activity.2 See\nBusacca, 936 F.2d at 237–38 (finding that six predicate acts committed in a span of two-\nand-a-half months was sufficient to establish open-ended continuity when the manner\nin which the racketeering activity occurred was capable of repetition indefinitely into the\nfuture). Accordingly, because the plaintiffs have adequately alleged conduct of an\nenterprise committed through a pattern of racketeering activity, Sedima, 473 U.S. at 496,\nwe find that the third amended complaint does state a claim upon which relief can be\ngranted under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). Dismissal of this claim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6)\nwas improper.\n\n                                                    III.\n\n         The plaintiffs also challenge the dismissal of their RICO conspiracy claim under\n18 U.S.C. § 1962(d). To plausibly state a claim for a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d),\nplaintiffs must successfully allege all the elements of a RICO violation, as well as\nalleging “the existence of an illicit agreement to violate the substantive RICO\nprovision.” United States v. Sinito, 723 F.2d 1250, 1260 (6th Cir. 1983). “An agreement\ncan be shown if the defendant objectively manifested an agreement to participate directly\nor indirectly in the affairs of an enterprise through the commission of two or more\npredicate crimes.” Id. at 1261 (internal quotation and editing marks omitted). The\nplaintiffs’ third amended complaint does allege that Boraggina and Beauvais conspired\nto conduct the affairs of Waiting Angels through a pattern of racketeering activity, and\nthis agreement can be inferred from the individual defendants’ involvement in the four\nwell-pled predicate acts in which they made false representations to hopeful adoptive\ncouples with the goal of defrauding those couples of money. Because the plaintiffs have\nadequately alleged both an underlying RICO violation and an agreement to participate\nin this violation, we find that the third amended complaint does state a claim upon which\n\n         2\n           The plaintiffs also allege that the predicate acts represented the defendants’ “regular way of\nconducting [their] on-going business activities,” which is another way to establish open-ended continuity.\nH.J. Inc., 492 U.S. at 243. Because we have found that the four predicate acts sufficiently demonstrate an\nongoing threat of racketeering activity, we need not decide the issue of whether the plaintiffs have\nincluded sufficient factual matter in their third amended complaint to find that this allegation is well-pled\nand not merely conclusory.\n\fNo. 09-2470       Heinrich, et al. v.

The district court dismissed with prejudice, pursuant to Rules 12(b)(6) and 9(b), all claims in the plaintiffs' third amended complaint brought under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\"RICO\"), 18 U.S.C. § 1962. On appeal, the plaintiffs argue (1) that the district court failed to include several alleged predicate acts in its analysis of their RICO claim, (2) that the district court erred in ruling that the third amended complaint did not adequately allege extortion, and (3) that the district court erred in concluding that the allegations in the third amended complaint failed to meet the requirement of continuity, which is necessary to establish a pattern of racketeering activity and a substantive RICO violation. For the reasons that follow, we reverse.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>The plaintiffs are seven couples who enlisted the assistance of the Waiting Angels Adoption Services, Inc. (\"Waiting Angels\") in an attempt to adopt children from Guatemala. Believing that they were defrauded in the course of their adoption efforts, the plaintiffs initiated suit in federal district court on October 24, 2006, naming Waiting Angels and its two principals, Simone Boraggina and Joseph Beauvais, as defendants. The original complaint was first amended on March 26, 2007. About a month later, the case was stayed due to the pendency of state criminal proceedings against the individual defendants. After the state criminal proceedings were resolved, the district court granted the plaintiffs' motion to lift the stay on April 2008 and granted them permission to file a second amended complaint.</p>\n<p>In response, the defendants filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings, pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(c) and 9(b), which the district court granted. Some claims were dismissed with prejudice, but the plaintiffs were granted leave to amend and replead certain claims, including: (1) a RICO claim under section 1962(c) alleging Waiting Angels Adoption Services, Inc. as the enterprise and Boraggina and Beauvais as individual defendants, with the plaintiffs allowed to allege as predicate acts violations of federal mail fraud, wire fraud, and extortion statutes as well as violations of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2314 and 1952; (2) a RICO claim under section 1962(d) for conspiracy between Boraggina and Beauvais only, including the predicate acts identified above; and (3) various state law claims that are not at issue in this appeal.</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs filed their third amended complaint on April 4, 2009. Counts 1 through 6 assert state law claims. Count 7 alleges violations of the mail and wire fraud statutes, 18 U.S.C. §§ 1341 and 1343, for the purpose of establishing the predicate acts of racketeering activity needed to support the RICO claims that follow. Count 8 asserts a claim that the individual defendants, Boraggina and Beauvais, committed a substantive RICO violation under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). It alleges that Waiting Angels constituted an \"enterprise\" within the meaning of the statute and that the individual defendants conducted the affairs of this enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity, particularly through extortion and fraud. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*401</span> Finally, Count 9 asserts a RICO conspiracy claim between Boraggina and Beauvais under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d).</p>\n<p>The third amended complaint contains the following allegations that are particularly relevant to this appeal. First, as a general matter, the plaintiffs allege that the defendants advertised Waiting Angels's services on the internet and that the defendants' website displayed children that were advertised as available for adoption. The plaintiffs also allege that Waiting Angels was advertised as a non-profit organization, when, in reality, it was a for-profit organization.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Plaintiffs Heinrich</i></h2>\n<p>The Heinriches allege that on June 13, 2005, they were sent an email by the defendants containing baby pictures and that they decided to attempt to adopt baby Selvin, a baby pictured in the email and apparently available for adoption. They signed a contract with Waiting Angels and wired $12,000 for a \"referral\" or match. About a month earlier, they had been told by Boraggina that \"[once] the dossier is certified, the adoption will be completed in 4-6 months.\" On January 30, 2006, Boraggina informed the Heinriches that the birth mother had not signed the necessary papers and the adoption could not proceed without this documentation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Plaintiffs Kruger and Flenniken (\"Flenniken plaintiffs\")</i></h2>\n<p>The Flenniken plaintiffs allege that in January 2006, they received an invoice for foster care fees for $1050 for baby Maria, the child they hoped to adopt. In mid-March 2006, they traveled to Guatemala and discovered that baby Maria remained in an orphanage and had never lived in foster care. Beauvais then sent the Flenniken plaintiffs an email demanding that they pay the rest of the adoption fees, and they responded that, under the adoption contract, the fees were not due until the case was out of PGN (the Guatemalan family court), and they would not pay until that time. The couple alleges that in response the defendants sent a request to the Guatemalan attorney to stop the adoption until they were sent a certified check.</p>\n<p>The Flenniken plaintiffs further allege that due to their frustration with Waiting Angels and the individual defendants, they hired a different adoption agency to complete their adoption.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Plaintiffs Casassa</i></h2>\n<p>The Casassas allege that they were matched with Guatemalan twins by the defendants around January 28, 2006, after which they signed an adoption agreement and wired money for adoption fees and foster fees. On May 24, 2006, Boraggina emailed to advise them that the twins had been reclaimed by their birth mother. They assert that the twins had not been reclaimed by their birth mother but instead were already matched with another family through a different adoption agency. They allege that Boraggina had knowledge of this fact at the end of January 2006, when Waiting Angels collected fees for the adoption. They support this allegation by asserting further: (1) during the four months they were \"matched\" with the twins, the defendants sent no photos or medical information; (2) the U.S. Embassy in Guatemala had no record of a pending adoption case involving the Casassas; (3) the defendants did not respond to demands for proof that the plaintiffs' money had been sent to Guatemala; and (4) the twins had not been reclaimed by their birth mother but were matched with another adoptive family through a different adoption agency.</p>\n<p>The Casassas also allege that on June 26, 2006, they contacted the defendants for an update and to inquire about the photos of new babies and toddlers being offered <span class=\"star-pagination\">*402</span> for adoption on the Waiting Angels website. The defendants informed the Casassas that the couple was not sent any referrals because the children pictured on the website were being handled by a Guatemalan attorney other than the attorney handling the twins' adoption. The couple further alleges that they were later told that the defendants could not get birth certificates for the babies they were displaying on the website.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Plaintiffs Tavolilla</i></h2>\n<p>The Tavolillas allege that they were considering baby Marvin for adoption and were sent his medical information by the defendants in May 2006. They were unsure of whether to begin the adoption process when they received a telephone call from Boraggina on May 25, 2006, advising them they needed to wire the money immediately to start the adoption process for baby Marvin because \"He's gonna go, He's gonna go, He's gonna go!!\" Shortly after wiring $16,000 to the defendants, the Tavolillas received a call from their pediatrician who determined that the child had serious health issues and advised them not to adopt the child. The Tavolillas allege that they were assured by Boraggina that if the child was not healthy, the adoption fee would be returned. When they made this refund request, however, Boraggina responded by saying that Beauvais was responsible for such financial matters, that he was unavailable for a few days, and that she thought the money had already been sent to an attorney in Guatemala.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Plaintiffs Lundy</i></h2>\n<p>The Lundys allege that after two other unsuccessful adoption attempts in which the couple paid a total of $26,550 in fees, they emailed the defendants on July 13, 2006 to inquire about another baby featured on the Waiting Angels website. In a reply email, Boraggina informed the Lundys that the baby about whom they inquired was \"unavailable to them because she was with a different attorney.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Plaintiffs Wright</i></h2>\n<p>The Wrights allege that in September 2005, they sent Waiting Angels $14,350 for the retainer fee and adoption payment for the adoption of baby Wendy, after which they were faxed an adoption agreement. The complaint does not contain any further details about the terms of this agreement for baby Wendy.</p>\n<p>On January 2, 2006, the Wrights decided to adopt another child, baby Estafany, and sent the defendants another $14,350 to begin the adoption process. The contract for baby Estafany required them to pay $350 per month to the defendants to \"offset private foster care fees for the child.\" The Wrights allege they learned through an investigator that the Guatemalan Adoption Agency and foster mother \"never received the $350 per month that they were being charged by the Defendants.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Plaintiffs Saenz</i></h2>\n<p>The Saenz plaintiffs allege that on February 2, 2006, they wired $8,500 to the defendants for payment of \"in country\" fees, which they were told would be sent to the facilitators in Guatemala for the adoption of baby Maria. They were also charged $350 per month for foster fees. On May 14, 2007, the Saenz plaintiffs discovered that the defendants had not paid the facilitator any money for the adoption and that the foster fees remained unpaid.</p>\n<p>In response to this third amended complaint, the defendants filed a second motion for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Rules 9(b) and 12(c) on May 15, 2009. After a hearing, the district court granted the defendants' motion, issuing an opinion in which it dismissed the federal claims with prejudice and the state law claims without prejudice. <i>Heinrich v. Waiting Angels Adoption Services, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*403</span> No. 5:06-cv-168, 2009 WL 3401171, at *20 (W.D.Mich. Oct. 19, 2009). Assessing the allegations that formed the basis for the RICO claims under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), the district court found that the complaint did not allege sufficient facts that could give rise to a plausible claim of extortion. The district court also concluded that there were only four plausible claims of mail or wire fraud, spanning the period between September 2005 to February 2006. The court went on to conclude that these four plausible claims were insufficient to show either a \"closed-ended\" or \"open-ended\" pattern of racketeering, and thus the plaintiffs were unable to establish a substantive violation of the RICO statute. Finally, the court found that the plaintiffs' RICO conspiracy claim could not stand because they were unable to plausibly allege an underlying RICO violation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>We review the district court's dismissal of a complaint pursuant to a Rule 12(c) motion <i>de novo. </i><i>Rawe v. Liberty Mut. Fire Ins. Co.,</i> 462 F.3d 521, 526 (6th Cir.2006). \"The manner of review under Rule 12(c) is the same as a review under Rule 12(b)(6). . . .\" <i>Vickers v. Fairfield Med. Ctr.,</i> 453 F.3d 757, 761 (6th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p>In assessing a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), this court construes the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, accepts the plaintiff's factual allegations as true, and determines whether the complaint \"contain[s] sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\" <i>Ashcroft v. Iqbal,</i> 556 U.S. 662, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (internal quotation and citation omitted); <i>Inge v. Rock Fin. Corp.,</i> 281 F.3d 613, 619 (6th Cir. 2002). A plaintiff's complaint must provide \"more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.\" <i>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly,</i> 550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). Courts are not required to accept as true legal conclusions couched as factual allegations. <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Papasan v. Allain,</i> 478 U.S. 265, 286, 106 S.Ct. 2932, 92 L.Ed.2d 209 (1986)). \"Factual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level. . . .\" <i>Id.</i> \"[O]nly a complaint that states a plausible claim for relief survives a motion to dismiss. . . . [W]here the well-pleaded facts do not permit the court to infer more than the mere possibility of misconduct, the complaint has allegedbut it has not `show[n]'`that the pleader is entitled to relief.'\" <i>Iqbal,</i> 129 S.Ct. at 1950 (quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2)) (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs must also meet the more rigorous pleading standards of Rule 9(b) with respect to their claims based on fraud. Rule 9(b) states that \"[i]n alleging fraud or mistake, a party must state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b). In order to allege fraud with particularity, the plaintiffs, at a minimum, must \"`allege the time, place, and content of the alleged misrepresentation on which [they] relied; the fraudulent scheme; the fraudulent intent of the defendants; and the injury resulting from the fraud.'\" <i>United States ex rel. Bledsoe v. Cmty. Health Sys., Inc.,</i> 342 F.3d 634, 643 (6th Cir.2003) (quoting <i>Coffey v. Foamex L.P.,</i> 2 F.3d 157, 161-62 (6th Cir.1993)).</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs challenge the dismissal of their RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote>It shall be unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*404</span> affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt.</blockquote>\n<p>18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). A violation of the statute requires \"(1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity.\" <i>Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co.,</i> 473 U.S. 479, 496, 105 S.Ct. 3275, 87 L.Ed.2d 346 (1985). A plaintiff must allege each element to properly state a claim. The plaintiffs challenge the district court's findings that only four predicate acts of racketeering activity were adequately alleged in the third amended complaint and that these four predicate acts were insufficient to establish a pattern of racketeering activity. As discussed below, we agree with the district court that the plaintiffs have only adequately pled four predicate acts of racketeering activity, but we find that these four acts are sufficient to establish a pattern of racketeering activity.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Predicate Acts of Racketeering Activity</h2>\n<p>Racketeering activity consists of acts which are indictable under a number of federal statutes listed in 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1)(B). In this case, the plaintiffs allege as predicate acts of racketeering activity: mail and wire fraud, 18 U.S.C. §§ 1341 and 1343; extortion in violation of the Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1951; transmitting or transferring in interstate commerce goods, wares, merchandise, or money knowing the same to have been stolen, converted, or taken by fraud, 18 U.S.C. § 2314; and traveling in interstate or foreign commerce with the intent to distribute the proceeds of extortion, 18 U.S.C. § 1952.</p>\n<p>On appeal, the plaintiffs argue that (1) the district court improperly ignored several predicate acts of mail and wire fraud committed by the defendants and (2) the district court incorrectly ruled that the third amended complaint did not adequately allege any predicate acts of extortion. These arguments are without merit.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Mail and Wire Fraud Allegations</h2>\n<p>Mail fraud consists of \"(1) a scheme to defraud, and (2) use of the mails in furtherance of the scheme.\" <i>United States v. Jamieson,</i> 427 F.3d 394, 402 (6th Cir.2005). The elements of wire fraud are essentially the same except that one must use the wires in furtherance of the scheme to defraud. <i>United States v. Daniel,</i> 329 F.3d 480, 486 n. 1 (6th Cir. 2003) (noting that the statutes share the same relevant language and the same analysis should be used for each). \"A scheme to defraud includes any plan or course of action by which someone uses false, deceptive, or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises to deprive someone else of money.\" <i>Jamieson,</i> 427 F.3d at 402. A plaintiff must also demonstrate <i>scienter</i> to establish a scheme to defraud, which is satisfied by showing the defendant acted either with a specific intent to defraud or with recklessness with respect to potentially misleading information. <i>United States v. DeSantis,</i> 134 F.3d 760, 764 (6th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p>When pleading predicate acts of mail or wire fraud, in order to satisfy the heightened pleading requirements of Rule 9(b), a plaintiff must \"(1) specify the statements that the plaintiff contends were fraudulent, (2) identify the speaker, (3) state where and when the statements were made, and (4) explain why the statements were fraudulent.\" <i>Frank v. Dana Corp.,</i> 547 F.3d 564, 570 (6th Cir.2008) (quoting <i>Gupta v. Terra Nitrogen Corp.,</i> 10 F.Supp.2d 879, 883 (N.D.Ohio 1998)). A RICO plaintiff is not required to plead or prove first-party reliance on an allegedly false statement. <i>See </i><i>Bridge v. Phoenix</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*405</span> <i>Bond &amp; Indem. Co.,</i> 553 U.S. 639, 648, 128 S.Ct. 2131, 170 L.Ed.2d 1012 (2008). To allege a valid RICO claim, however, a plaintiff must show not only that the predicate act was a \"but for\" cause of plaintiff's injuries, but also that it was a proximate cause. <i>Holmes v. Sec. Investor Prot. Corp.,</i> 503 U.S. 258, 268, 112 S.Ct. 1311, 117 L.Ed.2d 532 (1992). A plaintiff must show \"some direct relation between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>First, plaintiffs argue that the district court erred in disregarding allegedly fraudulent emails sent by the defendants in May 2005. To support their claim, the plaintiffs point to documents gathered in the state criminal prosecution of Boraggina and Beauvais and included in the plaintiffs' response to the second motion to dismiss. These documents reveal an incident where, in a request for references, Boraggina sent prospective clients, Jeff and Cheryl Smith, (who are not parties to this lawsuit) an email containing the names of purported former clients \"Tony and Carol Vitale\" and their email address. This email address was actually owned and controlled by Beauvais. A few days later, the Smiths received an email from \"the Vitales\" that gave Waiting Angels a positive review. Plaintiff Amanda Heinrich also claims that when she was considering contracting with Waiting Angels, she relied upon \"positive references\" which she received from an email address later discovered to be owned by the defendants. The plaintiffs argue that these fraudulent communications violate the wire fraud statute and should be included as an additional predicate act.</p>\n<p>These allegations, however, were not included in the plaintiffs' third amended complaint, and the plaintiffs never requested that the defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings be converted into a motion for summary judgment. A district court generally may only consider matters outside the pleadings if they treat the motion \"as one for summary judgment under Rule 56.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(d). <i>See </i><i>Jones v. City of Cincinnati,</i> 521 F.3d 555, 562 (6th Cir.2008). Because the district court did not convert the defendants' motion into a motion for summary judgment, it properly ruled on the motion without considering these additional allegations of wire fraud. <i>See Patterson v. Novartis Pharm. Corp.,</i> ___ Fed.Appx. ___, ___, No. 10-5886, 2011 WL 3701884, at *3 (6th Cir. August 23, 2011) (unpublished opinion).</p>\n<p>Furthermore, even if the district court should have considered these additional allegations, the Heinrich plaintiffs have still failed to allege wire fraud with the required particularity since Amanda Heinrich's affidavit does not include the date she received the allegedly fraudulent email from the defendants. The Heinriches have also failed to show how the misrepresentation of the true author of these emails was a proximate cause of any injury to their business or property. Their alleged injuries are too attenuated from the alleged fraud. Their argument appears to be that the positive references served as an inducement to do business with Waiting Angels. But any injuries they may have suffered were not the direct result of the alleged fraudulent conduct. Rather, the false references helped put the Heinriches in a position to be defrauded by other, unrelated representations concerning the availability of specific children or how adoption fees will be spent. The false references, while perhaps a \"but for\" cause of the Heinriches' injuries, did not proximately result in any harm to their business or property. Thus, the plaintiffs have not adequately alleged any additional predicate acts of wire fraud resulting from <span class=\"star-pagination\">*406</span> emails containing fraudulent positive references about Waiting Angels.</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs also argue that the district court improperly failed to include claims arising from alleged misrepresentations on the defendants' website as predicate acts of racketeering activity. The plaintiffs claim that the defendants \"frequently advertised children on their website who they knew, or should have known, were unavailable for adoption.\" They argue that the promise of ample children available for adoption induced them to pay non-refundable fees to facilitate adoptions that the defendants knew would be impossible to achieve. This argument is also without merit because the plaintiffs have not adequately alleged that the person making these representations acted with knowledge or reckless disregard of their falsity.</p>\n<p>\"Rule 9(b) requires not only specifying the false statements and by whom they were made but also identifying the basis for inferring scienter.\" <i>North Am. Catholic Educ. Programming Found., Inc. v. Cardinale,</i> 567 F.3d 8, 13 (1st Cir.2009). \"The courts have uniformly held inadequate a complaint's general averment of the defendant's `knowledge' of material falsity, unless the complaint <i>also</i> sets forth specific facts that make it reasonable to believe that defendant knew that a statement was materially false or misleading.\" <i>Greenstone v. Cambex Corp.,</i> 975 F.2d 22, 25 (1st Cir.1992). While the plaintiffs have alleged in a general and conclusory fashion that the defendants knew that children they were advertising as available for adoption were not actually available, they have failed to set forth specific facts that would support a reasonable inference that (1) the children were actually unavailable and (2) the defendants knew they were not available.</p>\n<p>For example, after an attempted adoption of a set of twins was unsuccessful, the Casassas alleged that they contacted the defendants and stated that the couple was \"aware of many new baby and toddler photos being offered for adoption\" on the Waiting Angels website. They alleged that defendants informed them that the couple was not sent any referrals because the children pictured on the website were being handled by a different Guatemalan attorney than the attorney handling the twins' adoptions. The couple further alleged that they were told later that the defendants could not get birth certificates for the babies they were displaying on the website.</p>\n<p>The complaint does not specify who told the couple that the defendants could not get the birth certificates for the babies advertised on the website. More importantly, the complaint does not provide sufficient facts from which it would be reasonable to infer that the children advertised were actually unavailable. Merely labeling the defendants' responses as \"suspicious\" does not suffice. Furthermore, the plaintiffs fail to allege any specific facts that would allow us to infer that at the time the defendants advertised children as available on their website, they made this promise of availability with knowledge of its falsity. These allegations raise only \"the mere possibility of misconduct\" and do not show the plaintiffs' entitlement to relief. <i>Iqbal,</i> 129 S.Ct. at 1950.</p>\n<p>In summary, the plaintiffs have failed to adequately allege any additional predicate acts of mail or wire fraud.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Extortion Allegations</h2>\n<p>The plaintiffs also argue that the district court incorrectly held that they had failed to properly allege any instance of extortion in their third amended complaint. A plaintiff claiming a Hobbs Act <span class=\"star-pagination\">*407</span> violation of extortion as a predicate act in a civil RICO claim must establish that the defendant \"obstruct[ed], delay[ed], or affect[ed] commerce or the movement of any article or commodity in commerce, by ... extortion or attempt[ed] or conspir[ed] so to do, or committ[ed] or threaten[ed] physical violence to any person or property in furtherance of a plan or purpose to do [so].\" 18 U.S.C. § 1951(a). Extortion is defined as \"the obtaining of property from another, with his consent, induced by wrongful use of actual or threatened force, violence, or fear, or under color of official right.\" 18 U.S.C. § 1951(b)(2).</p>\n<p>The concept of extortion is not limited to fear of physical violence. Under the \"fear of economic harm\" theory, a private citizen can commit extortion by leading the victim to believe that the perpetrator can exercise his or her power to the victim's economic detriment. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Kelley,</i> 461 F.3d 817, 826 (6th Cir.2006). \"[T]he fear of economic harm may arise independently of any action by the defendant, . . . [i]t is enough if the fear exists and the defendant intentionally exploits it.\" <i>United States v. Williams,</i> 952 F.2d 1504, 1513-14 (6th Cir.1991). The perpetrator's threats or exploitation of a victim's fear must also be \"wrongful\" to constitute extortion. 18 U.S.C. § 1951(b)(2). Thus, to properly claim acts of extortion in this case, the plaintiffs must allege facts and circumstances that show (1) that the defendants obtained the plaintiffs' property (2) through the wrongful use of (3) threats or fear of physical or economic harm.</p>\n<p>The Flennikens allege they were victims of criminal extortion when the couple learned that defendants Boraggina and Beauvais had requested that the Guatemalan attorney stop work on the adoption of the baby the couple was pursuing until the remainder of the adoption fees was paid. The plaintiffs labeled this conduct \"emotional terrorism\" but did not allege that they paid any money in response to this alleged threat. This claim does not amount to actionable extortion because the plaintiffs do not allege that the defendants \"obtained property\" as the result of this alleged threat. By statutory definition, extortion requires the victim to be deprived of property and the perpetrator to \"obtain\" that property. <i>Scheidler v. NOW, Inc.,</i> 537 U.S. 393, 405, 123 S.Ct. 1057, 154 L.Ed.2d 991 (2003). At most, the Flennikens have alleged that the defendants threatened them with emotional distress, which is insufficient to support a claim of extortion.</p>\n<p>The Tavolillas also allege they were subject to extortion. Their claim centers around the allegation that while they were still considering adopting baby Marvin but before their physician had completed his review of his medical records, they were contacted by defendant Boraggina. She advised them to begin the adoption process immediately, before their physician completed his review of the baby's health records, claiming \"He's gonna go!\" In response, the couple wired $16,000 to the defendants and began the adoption process, only to discover shortly thereafter that the baby suffered from serious health problems. These allegations show that Boraggina created a sense of urgency surrounding the start of the adoption process, but they do not establish that it was \"wrongful.\"</p>\n<p>First, the Tavolillas do not allege any additional facts or circumstances that would provide grounds to conclude that this sense of urgency was not warranted<i>i.e.,</i> that there was little chance that baby Marvin would soon become unavailable. So plaintiffs have not adequately alleged that this urgency was wrongful in the sense that it was false. Moreover, if we <span class=\"star-pagination\">*408</span> characterize the interaction between the plaintiffs and the defendants as a business transaction in which defendants are selling adoption services, the loss of the chance to adopt baby Marvin would place the Tavolillas in fear of an economic harm, which, if improperly exploited, could amount to extortion. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Collins,</i> 78 F.3d 1021, 1030-31 (6th Cir.1996) (finding that the possibility of lost business opportunities is a type of economic fear within the scope of extortion). But this fear and any sense of urgency created by Boraggina was not wrongful in the sense that it was unreasonable or unfair under the circumstances. In the business context, Boraggina's behavior is best characterized as hard bargaining or a pressure sales tactic. <i>See </i><i>Mathon v. Feldstein,</i> 303 F.Supp.2d 317, 325 (E.D.N.Y.2004) (finding that \"hard bargaining\" does not constitute extortion).</p>\n<p>On the other hand, if we consider the adoption process to be something other than a business transaction, the Tavolillas have not shown that they were placed in fear of an economic harm. Now, the loss of the opportunity to adopt baby Marvin would not be considered a lost business opportunity. Instead, the sense of urgency would have placed the Tavolillas in fear of purely emotional harmfear that they would regret missing the chance to adopt baby Marvin. The plaintiffs do not cite any case in which the concept of extortion includes the exploitation of the fear of purely emotional harm, such as the distress one would likely experience if a hoped for adoption was lost. For these reasons, we conclude the Tavolillas have not adequately alleged facts that might give rise to a plausible claim of extortion.</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs also claim that the defendants frequently advertised children on the Waiting Angels website who they knew or should have known were unavailable for adoption and that this conduct amounted to extortion. They argue that the defendants \"would play upon people's desire to adopt these children, wrongfully, to excise additional adoption fees from them.\" Setting aside the fact that this allegation was not pled in their complaint, it also is without merit. The use of a website to advertise children as available for adoption, who are actually unavailable, does not constitute a threat nor induce fear of economic, or even emotional harm. On the contrary, as the plaintiffs acknowledge, the sight of many children supposedly available for adoption on the Waiting Angels website would inspire hope, not fear, that a couple would ultimately find a child they could successfully adopt. The alleged unavailability of children on the Waiting Angels website is a claim that the defendants committed frauda claim discussed and dismissed earliernot that they committed extortion. In summary, the plaintiffs have failed to adequately allege any predicate acts of extortion in violation of the Hobbs Act in their third amended complaint.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. Adequately Pled Allegations</h2>\n<p>The district court found that the complaint sufficiently alleged four predicate acts of mail or wire fraud: the Casassas' claim of fraudulent representations made about the availability of a pair of twins (January 2006), and the Flennikens' (January 2006), Saenzs' (February 2006), and Wrights' (January 2006)<sup>[1]</sup> claims of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*409</span> fraudulent inducement of the payment of foster care expenses. <i>Heinrich,</i> 2009 WL 3401171 at *14, *16. We agree that these four claims do adequately allege predicate acts of mail or wire fraud as they have adequately alleged a scheme to defraud, the use of the mail or wires in furtherance of the scheme, and a sufficient factual basis from which to infer <i>scienter. See </i><i>Jamieson,</i> 427 F.3d at 402; <i>DeSantis,</i> 134 F.3d at 764; <i>Cardinale,</i> 567 F.3d at 13.</p>\n<p>The district court discussed and ultimately rejected many other claims of mail and wire fraud in its opinion, including claims by the Heinriches, Flennikens, Tavolillas, Lundys, Wrights, and Saenzs of \"promissory fraud\" involving representations concerning the defendants' timeliness and ability to complete adoptions and claims based on the alleged misrepresentation of Waiting Angels's nonprofit status. The rejection of these claims was proper, since the plaintiffs have not alleged sufficient information to render their claims of fraud plausible, as opposed to merely possible. <i>Iqbal,</i> 129 S.Ct. at 1950. As discussed above, the plaintiffs have not adequately alleged any additional predicate acts of mail or wire fraud or of extortion.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, the plaintiffs have adequately alleged four predicate acts of racketeering activity, spanning a two-month period from January 2006 through February 2006. The question then arises whether these four acts, if proven, would be sufficient to establish a pattern of racketeering activity.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Pattern of Racketeering Activity</h2>\n<p>To establish a substantive RICO violation, a plaintiff must show \"a pattern of racketeering activity.\" 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). A pattern of racketeering activity requires, at minimum, two acts of racketeering activity within ten years of each other. 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5). While the statute defines the minimum number of acts necessary to establish a pattern of racketeering activity, the Supreme Court has held that the minimum two acts are not necessarily sufficient. In order to show a \"pattern\" of racketeering activity, a plaintiff must show \"that the racketeering predicates are related, <i>and</i> that they amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal activity.\" <i>H.J. Inc. v. Nw. Bell Tel. Co.,</i> 492 U.S. 229, 237-39, 109 S.Ct. 2893, 106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989). This requirement has come to be called the \"relationship plus continuity\" test. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Brown v. Cassens Transp. Co.,</i> 546 F.3d 347, 355 (6th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p>The relationship prong of this test is satisfied by showing the predicate acts have \"similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of commission, or otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing characteristics and are not isolated events.\" <i>H.J. Inc.,</i> 492 U.S. at 240, 109 S.Ct. 2893. It has been satisfied in this case. The predicate acts were committed by the same participants, Beauvais and Borragina, for similar purposes with similar victims using similar methods of commission. The individual defendants used email correspondence, telephone conversations, and a website connected to their Waiting Angels adoption agency to defraud hopeful adoptive parents out of adoption-related fees.</p>\n<p>The continuity prong of the test can be satisfied by showing either a \"close-ended\" pattern (a series of related predicate acts extending over a substantial period of time) or an \"open-ended\" pattern (a set of predicate acts that poses a threat of continuing criminal conduct extending beyond the period in which the predicate <span class=\"star-pagination\">*410</span> acts were performed). <i>Id.</i> at 241-42, 109 S.Ct. 2893. The plaintiffs cannot establish close-ended continuity. \"A party alleging a RICO violation may demonstrate continuity over a closed period by proving a series of related predicates extending over a substantial period of time. Predicate acts extending over a few weeks or months. . . do not satisfy this [close-ended continuity] requirement. . . .\" <i>Id.</i> at 242, 109 S.Ct. 2893. (omitted text addresses the threat of future criminal conduct, which is part of an open-ended continuity analysis). This court has found that racketeering activity that spanned seventeen months did not constitute a substantial period of time. <i>See </i><i>Vemco, Inc. v. Camardella,</i> 23 F.3d 129, 134 (6th Cir.1994) (finding that allegations of four predicate acts, affecting one victim and spanning seventeen months, were insufficient to meet the continuity requirement). In this case, the predicate acts of racketeering activity spanned less than two monthsJanuary and February 2006and thus do not meet the requirements for close-ended continuity.</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs can, however, establish open-ended continuity. \"Often a RICO action will be brought before continuity can be established [by showing predicate acts spanning a substantial period of time]. In such cases, liability depends on whether the <i>threat</i> of continuity is demonstrated.\" <i>H.J. Inc.,</i> 492 U.S. at 242, 109 S.Ct. 2893. So the plaintiffs must plausibly allege that there was a threat of continuing criminal activity beyond the period during which the predicate acts were performed. Determining whether the predicate acts establish open-ended continuity requires a court to examine the specific facts of the case. <i>Id.</i> The threat of continuing racketeering activity need not be established, however, exclusively by reference to the predicate acts alone; rather, a court should consider the totality of the circumstances surrounding the commission of those acts. <i>Brown,</i> 546 F.3d at 355.</p>\n<p>The defendants argue that because Waiting Angels was shut down as part of the criminal prosecution of the individual defendants, the enterprise currently poses no threat of facilitating continued criminal activity, and the plaintiffs, therefore, cannot establish open-ended continuity. Subsequent events are irrelevant to the continuity determination, however, because \"in the context of an open-ended period of racketeering activity, the threat of continuity must be viewed at the time the racketeering activity occurred.\" <i>United States v. Busacca,</i> 936 F.2d 232, 238 (6th Cir.1991). \"The lack of a threat of continuity of racketeering activity cannot be asserted merely by showing a fortuitous interruption of that activity such as by an arrest, indictment or guilty verdict.\" <i>Id.; see also </i><i>Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Michigan v. Kamin,</i> 876 F.2d 543, 545 (6th Cir.1989) (finding that continuity was established because, if the defendant had not been caught, there was no reason to believe he would not still be submitting fraudulent insurance claims); <i>Moon v. Harrison Piping Supply,</i> 465 F.3d 719, 729 (6th Cir.2006) (Moore, J., concurring) (stating that the court should not consider events that transpired after the alleged racketeering acts ended when determining whether a threat of long-term racketeering activity has been properly alleged).</p>\n<p>Moreover, the complaint does not allege an inherently terminable schemea pattern of racketeering activity with a built-in ending pointthat has prevented this court from finding open-ended continuity in the past. <i>Vemco,</i> 23 F.3d at 134 (finding no open-ended continuity where only a single scheme to defraud one plaintiff the cost of one paint system was pled); <i>Vild v. Visconsi,</i> 956 F.2d 560, 569 (6th Cir.1992) (finding the plaintiff had failed to plead <span class=\"star-pagination\">*411</span> open-ended continuity when \"the acts alleged amount[ed] at best to a breach of contract with a single customer\"); <i>Thompson v. Paasche,</i> 950 F.2d 306, 311 (6th Cir.1991) (finding that there was no open-ended continuity because the defendant's fraudulent scheme to sell nineteen lots of land was \"an inherently short-term affair\" that would end once the lots were sold). Here, there is no inherent limit to the number of couples seeking to adopt or to the number of children that the defendants could hold out as available for adoption.</p>\n<p>At the time that the defendants committed the four predicate acts alleged here, there was no indication that their pattern of behavior would not continue indefinitely into the future. The plaintiffs have thus adequately alleged a threat of continuing criminal activity and, therefore, have sufficiently alleged a pattern of racketeering activity.<sup>[2]</sup><i>See </i><i>Busacca,</i> 936 F.2d at 237-38 (finding that six predicate acts committed in a span of two-and-a-half months was sufficient to establish open-ended continuity when the manner in which the racketeering activity occurred was capable of repetition indefinitely into the future). Accordingly, because the plaintiffs have adequately alleged conduct of an enterprise committed through a pattern of racketeering activity, <i>Sedima,</i> 473 U.S. at 496, 105 S.Ct. 3275, we find that the third amended complaint does state a claim upon which relief can be granted under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). Dismissal of this claim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) was improper.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>The plaintiffs also challenge the dismissal of their RICO conspiracy claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d). To plausibly state a claim for a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d), plaintiffs must successfully allege all the elements of a RICO violation, as well as alleging \"the existence of an illicit agreement to violate the substantive RICO provision.\" <i>United States v. Sinito,</i> 723 F.2d 1250, 1260 (6th Cir. 1983). \"An agreement can be shown if the defendant objectively manifested an agreement to participate directly or indirectly in the affairs of an enterprise through the commission of two or more predicate crimes.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1261 (internal quotation and editing marks omitted). The plaintiffs' third amended complaint does allege that Boraggina and Beauvais conspired to conduct the affairs of Waiting Angels through a pattern of racketeering activity, and this agreement can be inferred from the individual defendants' involvement in the four well-pled predicate acts in which they made false representations to hopeful adoptive couples with the goal of defrauding those couples of money. Because the plaintiffs have adequately alleged both an underlying RICO violation and an agreement to participate in this violation, we find that the third amended complaint does state a claim upon which relief can be granted under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d). Dismissal of this claim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) was also improper.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV.</h2>\n<p>For the reasons provided above, we reverse the district court's judgment that dismissed the plaintiffs' RICO claims <span class=\"star-pagination\">*412</span> brought under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) and (d), and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  The Honorable John R. Adams, United States District Judge for the Northern District of Ohio, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  The district court mistakenly stated that the date of the Wrights' claim for fraudulent inducement of the payment of foster care expenses was September 2005. The Wrights allege that they entered into two contracts and made payments to Waiting Angels for two different children, one in September 2005 and one in January 2006. The claim involving foster care fees arose out the contract for baby Estafany, entered into in January 2006.</p>\n<p>[2]  The plaintiffs also allege that the predicate acts represented the defendants' \"regular way of conducting [their] on-going business activities,\" which is another way to establish open-ended continuity. <i>H.J. Inc.,</i> 492 U.S. at 243, 109 S.Ct. 2893. Because we have found that the four predicate acts sufficiently demonstrate an ongoing threat of racketeering activity, we need not decide the issue of whether the plaintiffs have included sufficient factual matter in their third amended complaint to find that this allegation is well-pled and not merely conclusory.</p>\n\n</div>",

The district court dismissed with prejudice, pursuant to Rules 12(b)(6) and 9(b), all claims in the plaintiffs' third amended complaint brought under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\"RICO\"), 18 U.S.C. § 1962. On appeal, the plaintiffs argue (1) that the district court failed to include several alleged predicate acts in its analysis of their RICO claim, (2) that the district court erred in ruling that the third amended complaint did not adequately allege extortion, and (3) that the district court erred in concluding that the allegations in the third amended complaint failed to meet the requirement of continuity, which is necessary to establish a pattern of racketeering activity and a substantive RICO violation. For the reasons that follow, we reverse.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>The plaintiffs are seven couples who enlisted the assistance of the Waiting Angels Adoption Services, Inc. (\"Waiting Angels\") in an attempt to adopt children from Guatemala. Believing that they were defrauded in the course of their adoption efforts, the plaintiffs initiated suit in federal district court on October 24, 2006, naming Waiting Angels and its two principals, Simone Boraggina and Joseph Beauvais, as defendants. The original complaint was first amended on March 26, 2007. About a month later, the case was stayed due to the pendency of state criminal proceedings against the individual defendants. After the state criminal proceedings were resolved, the district court granted the plaintiffs' motion to lift the stay on April 2008 and granted them permission to file a second amended complaint.</p>\n<p>In response, the defendants filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings, pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(c) and 9(b), which the district court granted. Some claims were dismissed with prejudice, but the plaintiffs were granted leave to amend and replead certain claims, including: (1) a RICO claim under section 1962(c) alleging Waiting Angels Adoption Services, Inc. as the enterprise and Boraggina and Beauvais as individual defendants, with the plaintiffs allowed to allege as predicate acts violations of federal mail fraud, wire fraud, and extortion statutes as well as violations of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2314 and 1952; (2) a RICO claim under section 1962(d) for conspiracy between Boraggina and Beauvais only, including the predicate acts identified above; and (3) various state law claims that are not at issue in this appeal.</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs filed their third amended complaint on April 4, 2009. Counts 1 through 6 assert state law claims. Count 7 alleges violations of the mail and wire fraud statutes, 18 U.S.C. §§ 1341 and 1343, for the purpose of establishing the predicate acts of racketeering activity needed to support the RICO claims that follow. Count 8 asserts a claim that the individual defendants, Boraggina and Beauvais, committed a substantive RICO violation under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). It alleges that Waiting Angels constituted an \"enterprise\" within the meaning of the statute and that the individual defendants conducted the affairs of this enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity, particularly through extortion and fraud. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*401</span> Finally, Count 9 asserts a RICO conspiracy claim between Boraggina and Beauvais under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d).</p>\n<p>The third amended complaint contains the following allegations that are particularly relevant to this appeal. First, as a general matter, the plaintiffs allege that the defendants advertised Waiting Angels's services on the internet and that the defendants' website displayed children that were advertised as available for adoption. The plaintiffs also allege that Waiting Angels was advertised as a non-profit organization, when, in reality, it was a for-profit organization.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Plaintiffs Heinrich</i></h2>\n<p>The Heinriches allege that on June 13, 2005, they were sent an email by the defendants containing baby pictures and that they decided to attempt to adopt baby Selvin, a baby pictured in the email and apparently available for adoption. They signed a contract with Waiting Angels and wired $12,000 for a \"referral\" or match. About a month earlier, they had been told by Boraggina that \"[once] the dossier is certified, the adoption will be completed in 4-6 months.\" On January 30, 2006, Boraggina informed the Heinriches that the birth mother had not signed the necessary papers and the adoption could not proceed without this documentation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Plaintiffs Kruger and Flenniken (\"Flenniken plaintiffs\")</i></h2>\n<p>The Flenniken plaintiffs allege that in January 2006, they received an invoice for foster care fees for $1050 for baby Maria, the child they hoped to adopt. In mid-March 2006, they traveled to Guatemala and discovered that baby Maria remained in an orphanage and had never lived in foster care. Beauvais then sent the Flenniken plaintiffs an email demanding that they pay the rest of the adoption fees, and they responded that, under the adoption contract, the fees were not due until the case was out of PGN (the Guatemalan family court), and they would not pay until that time. The couple alleges that in response the defendants sent a request to the Guatemalan attorney to stop the adoption until they were sent a certified check.</p>\n<p>The Flenniken plaintiffs further allege that due to their frustration with Waiting Angels and the individual defendants, they hired a different adoption agency to complete their adoption.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Plaintiffs Casassa</i></h2>\n<p>The Casassas allege that they were matched with Guatemalan twins by the defendants around January 28, 2006, after which they signed an adoption agreement and wired money for adoption fees and foster fees. On May 24, 2006, Boraggina emailed to advise them that the twins had been reclaimed by their birth mother. They assert that the twins had not been reclaimed by their birth mother but instead were already matched with another family through a different adoption agency. They allege that Boraggina had knowledge of this fact at the end of January 2006, when Waiting Angels collected fees for the adoption. They support this allegation by asserting further: (1) during the four months they were \"matched\" with the twins, the defendants sent no photos or medical information; (2) the U.S. Embassy in Guatemala had no record of a pending adoption case involving the Casassas; (3) the defendants did not respond to demands for proof that the plaintiffs' money had been sent to Guatemala; and (4) the twins had not been reclaimed by their birth mother but were matched with another adoptive family through a different adoption agency.</p>\n<p>The Casassas also allege that on June 26, 2006, they contacted the defendants for an update and to inquire about the photos of new babies and toddlers being offered <span class=\"star-pagination\">*402</span> for adoption on the Waiting Angels website. The defendants informed the Casassas that the couple was not sent any referrals because the children pictured on the website were being handled by a Guatemalan attorney other than the attorney handling the twins' adoption. The couple further alleges that they were later told that the defendants could not get birth certificates for the babies they were displaying on the website.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Plaintiffs Tavolilla</i></h2>\n<p>The Tavolillas allege that they were considering baby Marvin for adoption and were sent his medical information by the defendants in May 2006. They were unsure of whether to begin the adoption process when they received a telephone call from Boraggina on May 25, 2006, advising them they needed to wire the money immediately to start the adoption process for baby Marvin because \"He's gonna go, He's gonna go, He's gonna go!!\" Shortly after wiring $16,000 to the defendants, the Tavolillas received a call from their pediatrician who determined that the child had serious health issues and advised them not to adopt the child. The Tavolillas allege that they were assured by Boraggina that if the child was not healthy, the adoption fee would be returned. When they made this refund request, however, Boraggina responded by saying that Beauvais was responsible for such financial matters, that he was unavailable for a few days, and that she thought the money had already been sent to an attorney in Guatemala.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Plaintiffs Lundy</i></h2>\n<p>The Lundys allege that after two other unsuccessful adoption attempts in which the couple paid a total of $26,550 in fees, they emailed the defendants on July 13, 2006 to inquire about another baby featured on the Waiting Angels website. In a reply email, Boraggina informed the Lundys that the baby about whom they inquired was \"unavailable to them because she was with a different attorney.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Plaintiffs Wright</i></h2>\n<p>The Wrights allege that in September 2005, they sent Waiting Angels $14,350 for the retainer fee and adoption payment for the adoption of baby Wendy, after which they were faxed an adoption agreement. The complaint does not contain any further details about the terms of this agreement for baby Wendy.</p>\n<p>On January 2, 2006, the Wrights decided to adopt another child, baby Estafany, and sent the defendants another $14,350 to begin the adoption process. The contract for baby Estafany required them to pay $350 per month to the defendants to \"offset private foster care fees for the child.\" The Wrights allege they learned through an investigator that the Guatemalan Adoption Agency and foster mother \"never received the $350 per month that they were being charged by the Defendants.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Plaintiffs Saenz</i></h2>\n<p>The Saenz plaintiffs allege that on February 2, 2006, they wired $8,500 to the defendants for payment of \"in country\" fees, which they were told would be sent to the facilitators in Guatemala for the adoption of baby Maria. They were also charged $350 per month for foster fees. On May 14, 2007, the Saenz plaintiffs discovered that the defendants had not paid the facilitator any money for the adoption and that the foster fees remained unpaid.</p>\n<p>In response to this third amended complaint, the defendants filed a second motion for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Rules 9(b) and 12(c) on May 15, 2009. After a hearing, the district court granted the defendants' motion, issuing an opinion in which it dismissed the federal claims with prejudice and the state law claims without prejudice. <i>Heinrich v. Waiting Angels Adoption Services, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*403</span> No. 5:06-cv-168, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2009</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">3401171</span></span>, at *20 (W.D.Mich. Oct. 19, 2009). Assessing the allegations that formed the basis for the RICO claims under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), the district court found that the complaint did not allege sufficient facts that could give rise to a plausible claim of extortion. The district court also concluded that there were only four plausible claims of mail or wire fraud, spanning the period between September 2005 to February 2006. The court went on to conclude that these four plausible claims were insufficient to show either a \"closed-ended\" or \"open-ended\" pattern of racketeering, and thus the plaintiffs were unable to establish a substantive violation of the RICO statute. Finally, the court found that the plaintiffs' RICO conspiracy claim could not stand because they were unable to plausibly allege an underlying RICO violation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>We review the district court's dismissal of a complaint pursuant to a Rule 12(c) motion <i>de novo. </i><i>Rawe v.

The plaintiffs challenge the district court's findings that only four predicate acts of racketeering activity were adequately alleged in the third amended complaint and that these four predicate acts were insufficient to establish a pattern of racketeering activity. As discussed below, we agree with the district court that the plaintiffs have only adequately pled four predicate acts of racketeering activity, but we find that these four acts are sufficient to establish a pattern of racketeering activity.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Predicate Acts of Racketeering Activity</h2>\n<p>Racketeering activity consists of acts which are indictable under a number of federal statutes listed in 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1)(B). In this case, the plaintiffs allege as predicate acts of racketeering activity: mail and wire fraud, 18 U.S.C. §§ 1341 and 1343; extortion in violation of the Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1951; transmitting or transferring in interstate commerce goods, wares, merchandise, or money knowing the same to have been stolen, converted, or taken by fraud, 18 U.S.C. § 2314; and traveling in interstate or foreign commerce with the intent to distribute the proceeds of extortion, 18 U.S.C. § 1952.</p>\n<p>On appeal, the plaintiffs argue that (1) the district court improperly ignored several predicate acts of mail and wire fraud committed by the defendants and (2) the district court incorrectly ruled that the third amended complaint did not adequately allege any predicate acts of extortion. These arguments are without merit.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Mail and Wire Fraud Allegations</h2>\n<p>Mail fraud consists of \"(1) a scheme to defraud, and (2) use of the mails in furtherance of the scheme.\" <i>United States v.

The elements of wire fraud are essentially the same except that one must use the wires in furtherance of the scheme to defraud. <i>United States v.

A plaintiff must also demonstrate <i>scienter</i> to establish a scheme to defraud, which is satisfied by showing the defendant acted either with a specific intent to defraud or with recklessness with respect to potentially misleading information. <i>United States v. DeSantis,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"751125\"><a href=\"/opinion/751125/fed-sec-l-rep-p-90120-48-fed-r-evid-serv-807-united-states-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">760</span></a></span>, 764 (6th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p>When pleading predicate acts of mail or wire fraud, in order to satisfy the heightened pleading requirements of Rule 9(b), a plaintiff must \"(1) specify the statements that the plaintiff contends were fraudulent, (2) identify the speaker, (3) state where and when the statements were made, and (4) explain why the statements were fraudulent.\" <i>Frank v.

To allege a valid RICO claim, however, a plaintiff must show not only that the predicate act was a \"but for\" cause of plaintiff's injuries, but also that it was a proximate cause. <i>Holmes v. Sec.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">532</span></a></span> (1992). A plaintiff must show \"some direct relation between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>First, plaintiffs argue that the district court erred in disregarding allegedly fraudulent emails sent by the defendants in May 2005. To support their claim, the plaintiffs point to documents gathered in the state criminal prosecution of Boraggina and Beauvais and included in the plaintiffs' response to the second motion to dismiss. These documents reveal an incident where, in a request for references, Boraggina sent prospective clients, Jeff and Cheryl Smith, (who are not parties to this lawsuit) an email containing the names of purported former clients \"Tony and Carol Vitale\" and their email address. This email address was actually owned and controlled by Beauvais. A few days later, the Smiths received an email from \"the Vitales\" that gave Waiting Angels a positive review. Plaintiff Amanda Heinrich also claims that when she was considering contracting with Waiting Angels, she relied upon \"positive references\" which she received from an email address later discovered to be owned by the defendants. The plaintiffs argue that these fraudulent communications violate the wire fraud statute and should be included as an additional predicate act.</p>\n<p>These allegations, however, were not included in the plaintiffs' third amended complaint, and the plaintiffs never requested that the defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings be converted into a motion for summary judgment. A district court generally may only consider matters outside the pleadings if they treat the motion \"as one for summary judgment under Rule 56.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(d). <i>See </i><i>Jones v. City of Cincinnati,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1301406\"><a href=\"/opinion/1301406/jones-v-city-of-cincinnati/\"><span class=\"volume\">521</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">555</span></a></span>, 562 (6th Cir.2008). Because the district court did not convert the defendants' motion into a motion for summary judgment, it properly ruled on the motion without considering these additional allegations of wire fraud. <i>See Patterson v. Novartis Pharm. Corp.,</i> ___ Fed.Appx. ___, ___, No. 10-5886, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2011</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">3701884</span></span>, at *3 (6th Cir. August 23, 2011) (unpublished opinion).</p>\n<p>Furthermore, even if the district court should have considered these additional allegations, the Heinrich plaintiffs have still failed to allege wire fraud with the required particularity since Amanda Heinrich's affidavit does not include the date she received the allegedly fraudulent email from the defendants. The Heinriches have also failed to show how the misrepresentation of the true author of these emails was a proximate cause of any injury to their business or property. Their alleged injuries are too attenuated from the alleged fraud. Their argument appears to be that the positive references served as an inducement to do business with Waiting Angels. But any injuries they may have suffered were not the direct result of the alleged fraudulent conduct. Rather, the false references helped put the Heinriches in a position to be defrauded by other, unrelated representations concerning the availability of specific children or how adoption fees will be spent. The false references, while perhaps a \"but for\" cause of the Heinriches' injuries, did not proximately result in any harm to their business or property. Thus, the plaintiffs have not adequately alleged any additional predicate acts of wire fraud resulting from <span class=\"star-pagination\">*406</span> emails containing fraudulent positive references about Waiting Angels.</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs also argue that the district court improperly failed to include claims arising from alleged misrepresentations on the defendants' website as predicate acts of racketeering activity. The plaintiffs claim that the defendants \"frequently advertised children on their website who they knew, or should have known, were unavailable for adoption.\" They argue that the promise of ample children available for adoption induced them to pay non-refundable fees to facilitate adoptions that the defendants knew would be impossible to achieve. This argument is also without merit because the plaintiffs have not adequately alleged that the person making these representations acted with knowledge or reckless disregard of their falsity.</p>\n<p>\"Rule 9(b) requires not only specifying the false statements and by whom they were made but also identifying the basis for inferring scienter.\" <i>North Am. Catholic Educ. Programming Found., Inc. v. Cardinale,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203823\"><a href=\"/opinion/203823/north-american-catholic-educ-programming-foundation-v-cardinale/\"><span class=\"volume\">567</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">8</span></a></span>, 13 (1st Cir.2009). \"The courts have uniformly held inadequate a complaint's general averment of the defendant's `knowledge' of material falsity, unless the complaint <i>also</i> sets forth specific facts that make it reasonable to believe that defendant knew that a statement was materially false or misleading.\" <i>Greenstone v. Cambex Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"590895\"><a href=\"/opinion/590895/amy-greenstone-and-all-others-similarly-situated-v-cambex-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">975</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">22</span></a></span>, 25 (1st Cir.1992). While the plaintiffs have alleged in a general and conclusory fashion that the defendants knew that children they were advertising as available for adoption were not actually available, they have failed to set forth specific facts that would support a reasonable inference that (1) the children were actually unavailable and (2) the defendants knew they were not available.</p>\n<p>For example, after an attempted adoption of a set of twins was unsuccessful, the Casassas alleged that they contacted the defendants and stated that the couple was \"aware of many new baby and toddler photos being offered for adoption\" on the Waiting Angels website. They alleged that defendants informed them that the couple was not sent any referrals because the children pictured on the website were being handled by a different Guatemalan attorney than the attorney handling the twins' adoptions. The couple further alleged that they were told later that the defendants could not get birth certificates for the babies they were displaying on the website.</p>\n<p>The complaint does not specify who told the couple that the defendants could not get the birth certificates for the babies advertised on the website. More importantly, the complaint does not provide sufficient facts from which it would be reasonable to infer that the children advertised were actually unavailable. Merely labeling the defendants' responses as \"suspicious\" does not suffice. Furthermore, the plaintiffs fail to allege any specific facts that would allow us to infer that at the time the defendants advertised children as available on their website, they made this promise of availability with knowledge of its falsity. These allegations raise only \"the mere possibility of misconduct\" and do not show the plaintiffs' entitlement to relief. <i>Iqbal,</i> 129 S.Ct. at 1950.</p>\n<p>In summary, the plaintiffs have failed to adequately allege any additional predicate acts of mail or wire fraud.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Extortion Allegations</h2>\n<p>The plaintiffs also argue that the district court incorrectly held that they had failed to properly allege any instance of extortion in their third amended complaint. A plaintiff claiming a Hobbs Act <span class=\"star-pagination\">*407</span> violation of extortion as a predicate act in a civil RICO claim must establish that the defendant \"obstruct[ed], delay[ed], or affect[ed] commerce or the movement of any article or commodity in commerce, by ... extortion or attempt[ed] or conspir[ed] so to do, or committ[ed] or threaten[ed] physical violence to any person or property in furtherance of a plan or purpose to do [so].\" 18 U.S.C. § 1951(a). Extortion is defined as \"the obtaining of property from another, with his consent, induced by wrongful use of actual or threatened force, violence, or fear, or under color of official right.\" 18 U.S.C. § 1951(b)(2).</p>\n<p>The concept of extortion is not limited to fear of physical violence. Under the \"fear of economic harm\" theory, a private citizen can commit extortion by leading the victim to believe that the perpetrator can exercise his or her power to the victim's economic detriment. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Kelley,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"795548\"><a href=\"/opinion/795548/united-states-v-wilbourne-a-kelley-iii-05-1435-barbara-kelley-05-1361/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">817</span></a></span>, 826 (6th Cir.2006). \"[T]he fear of economic harm may arise independently of any action by the defendant, . . . [i]t is enough if the fear exists and the defendant intentionally exploits it.\" <i>United States v. Williams,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"575199\"><a href=\"/opinion/575199/united-states-v-jerry-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">952</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1504</span></a></span>, 1513-14 (6th Cir.1991). The perpetrator's threats or exploitation of a victim's fear must also be \"wrongful\" to constitute extortion. 18 U.S.C. § 1951(b)(2). Thus, to properly claim acts of extortion in this case, the plaintiffs must allege facts and circumstances that show (1) that the defendants obtained the plaintiffs' property (2) through the wrongful use of (3) threats or fear of physical or economic harm.</p>\n<p>The Flennikens allege they were victims of criminal extortion when the couple learned that defendants Boraggina and Beauvais had requested that the Guatemalan attorney stop work on the adoption of the baby the couple was pursuing until the remainder of the adoption fees was paid. The plaintiffs labeled this conduct \"emotional terrorism\" but did not allege that they paid any money in response to this alleged threat. This claim does not amount to actionable extortion because the plaintiffs do not allege that the defendants \"obtained property\" as the result of this alleged threat. By statutory definition, extortion requires the victim to be deprived of property and the perpetrator to \"obtain\" that property. <i>Scheidler v. NOW, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"122260\"><a href=\"/opinion/122260/scheidler-v-national-organization-for-women-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">537</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">393</span></a></span>, 405, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"122260\"><a href=\"/opinion/122260/scheidler-v-national-organization-for-women-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1057</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"122260\"><a href=\"/opinion/122260/scheidler-v-national-organization-for-women-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">154</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">991</span></a></span> (2003). At most, the Flennikens have alleged that the defendants threatened them with emotional distress, which is insufficient to support a claim of extortion.</p>\n<p>The Tavolillas also allege they were subject to extortion. Their claim centers around the allegation that while they were still considering adopting baby Marvin but before their physician had completed his review of his medical records, they were contacted by defendant Boraggina. She advised them to begin the adoption process immediately, before their physician completed his review of the baby's health records, claiming \"He's gonna go!\" In response, the couple wired $16,000 to the defendants and began the adoption process, only to discover shortly thereafter that the baby suffered from serious health problems. These allegations show that Boraggina created a sense of urgency surrounding the start of the adoption process, but they do not establish that it was \"wrongful.\"</p>\n<p>First, the Tavolillas do not allege any additional facts or circumstances that would provide grounds to conclude that this sense of urgency was not warranted<i>i.e.,</i> that there was little chance that baby Marvin would soon become unavailable. So plaintiffs have not adequately alleged that this urgency was wrongful in the sense that it was false. Moreover, if we <span class=\"star-pagination\">*408</span> characterize the interaction between the plaintiffs and the defendants as a business transaction in which defendants are selling adoption services, the loss of the chance to adopt baby Marvin would place the Tavolillas in fear of an economic harm, which, if improperly exploited, could amount to extortion. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Collins,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"714818\"><a href=\"/opinion/714818/united-states-v-billy-louis-collins/\"><span class=\"volume\">78</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1021</span></a></span>, 1030-31 (6th Cir.1996) (finding that the possibility of lost business opportunities is a type of economic fear within the scope of extortion). But this fear and any sense of urgency created by Boraggina was not wrongful in the sense that it was unreasonable or unfair under the circumstances. In the business context, Boraggina's behavior is best characterized as hard bargaining or a pressure sales tactic. <i>See </i><i>Mathon v. Feldstein,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2504383\"><a href=\"/opinion/2504383/mathon-v-feldstein/\"><span class=\"volume\">303</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">317</span></a></span>, 325 (E.D.N.Y.2004) (finding that \"hard bargaining\" does not constitute extortion).</p>\n<p>On the other hand, if we consider the adoption process to be something other than a business transaction, the Tavolillas have not shown that they were placed in fear of an economic harm. Now, the loss of the opportunity to adopt baby Marvin would not be considered a lost business opportunity. Instead, the sense of urgency would have placed the Tavolillas in fear of purely emotional harmfear that they would regret missing the chance to adopt baby Marvin. The plaintiffs do not cite any case in which the concept of extortion includes the exploitation of the fear of purely emotional harm, such as the distress one would likely experience if a hoped for adoption was lost. For these reasons, we conclude the Tavolillas have not adequately alleged facts that might give rise to a plausible claim of extortion.</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs also claim that the defendants frequently advertised children on the Waiting Angels website who they knew or should have known were unavailable for adoption and that this conduct amounted to extortion. They argue that the defendants \"would play upon people's desire to adopt these children, wrongfully, to excise additional adoption fees from them.\" Setting aside the fact that this allegation was not pled in their complaint, it also is without merit. The use of a website to advertise children as available for adoption, who are actually unavailable, does not constitute a threat nor induce fear of economic, or even emotional harm. On the contrary, as the plaintiffs acknowledge, the sight of many children supposedly available for adoption on the Waiting Angels website would inspire hope, not fear, that a couple would ultimately find a child they could successfully adopt. The alleged unavailability of children on the Waiting Angels website is a claim that the defendants committed frauda claim discussed and dismissed earliernot that they committed extortion. In summary, the plaintiffs have failed to adequately allege any predicate acts of extortion in violation of the Hobbs Act in their third amended complaint.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. Adequately Pled Allegations</h2>\n<p>The district court found that the complaint sufficiently alleged four predicate acts of mail or wire fraud: the Casassas' claim of fraudulent representations made about the availability of a pair of twins (January 2006), and the Flennikens' (January 2006), Saenzs' (February 2006), and Wrights' (January 2006)<sup>[1]</sup> claims of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*409</span> fraudulent inducement of the payment of foster care expenses. <i>Heinrich,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2009</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">3401171</span></span> at *14, *16. We agree that these four claims do adequately allege predicate acts of mail or wire fraud as they have adequately alleged a scheme to defraud, the use of the mail or wires in furtherance of the scheme, and a sufficient factual basis from which to infer <i>scienter. See </i><i>Jamieson,</i> 427 F.3d at 402; <i>DeSantis,</i> 134 F.3d at 764; <i>Cardinale,</i> 567 F.3d at 13.</p>\n<p>The district court discussed and ultimately rejected many other claims of mail and wire fraud in its opinion, including claims by the Heinriches, Flennikens, Tavolillas, Lundys, Wrights, and Saenzs of \"promissory fraud\" involving representations concerning the defendants' timeliness and ability to complete adoptions and claims based on the alleged misrepresentation of Waiting Angels's nonprofit status. The rejection of these claims was proper, since the plaintiffs have not alleged sufficient information to render their claims of fraud plausible, as opposed to merely possible. <i>Iqbal,</i> 129 S.Ct. at 1950. As discussed above, the plaintiffs have not adequately alleged any additional predicate acts of mail or wire fraud or of extortion.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, the plaintiffs have adequately alleged four predicate acts of racketeering activity, spanning a two-month period from January 2006 through February 2006. The question then arises whether these four acts, if proven, would be sufficient to establish a pattern of racketeering activity.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Pattern of Racketeering Activity</h2>\n<p>To establish a substantive RICO violation, a plaintiff must show \"a pattern of racketeering activity.\" 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). A pattern of racketeering activity requires, at minimum, two acts of racketeering activity within ten years of each other. 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5). While the statute defines the minimum number of acts necessary to establish a pattern of racketeering activity, the Supreme Court has held that the minimum two acts are not necessarily sufficient. In order to show a \"pattern\" of racketeering activity, a plaintiff must show \"that the racketeering predicates are related, <i>and</i> that they amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal activity.\" <i>H.J. Inc. v. Nw. Bell Tel. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112323\"><a href=\"/opinion/112323/hj-inc-v-northwestern-bell-telephone-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">492</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">229</span></a></span>, 237-39, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112323\"><a href=\"/opinion/112323/hj-inc-v-northwestern-bell-telephone-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2893</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112323\"><a href=\"/opinion/112323/hj-inc-v-northwestern-bell-telephone-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">195</span></a></span> (1989). This requirement has come to be called the \"relationship plus continuity\" test. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Brown v. Cassens Transp. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1361498\"><a href=\"/opinion/1361498/brown-v-cassens-transport-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">546</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">347</span></a></span>, 355 (6th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p>The relationship prong of this test is satisfied by showing the predicate acts have \"similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of commission, or otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing characteristics and are not isolated events.\" <i>H.J. Inc.,</i> 492 U.S. at 240, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112323\"><a href=\"/opinion/112323/hj-inc-v-northwestern-bell-telephone-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2893</span></a></span>. It has been satisfied in this case. The predicate acts were committed by the same participants, Beauvais and Borragina, for similar purposes with similar victims using similar methods of commission. The individual defendants used email correspondence, telephone conversations, and a website connected to their Waiting Angels adoption agency to defraud hopeful adoptive parents out of adoption-related fees.</p>\n<p>The continuity prong of the test can be satisfied by showing either a \"close-ended\" pattern (a series of related predicate acts extending over a substantial period of time) or an \"open-ended\" pattern (a set of predicate acts that poses a threat of continuing criminal conduct extending beyond the period in which the predicate <span class=\"star-pagination\">*410</span> acts were performed). <i>Id.</i> at 241-42, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112323\"><a href=\"/opinion/112323/hj-inc-v-northwestern-bell-telephone-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2893</span></a></span>. The plaintiffs cannot establish close-ended continuity. \"A party alleging a RICO violation may demonstrate continuity over a closed period by proving a series of related predicates extending over a substantial period of time. Predicate acts extending over a few weeks or months. . . do not satisfy this [close-ended continuity] requirement. . . .\" <i>Id.</i> at 242, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112323\"><a href=\"/opinion/112323/hj-inc-v-northwestern-bell-telephone-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2893</span></a></span>. (omitted text addresses the threat of future criminal conduct, which is part of an open-ended continuity analysis). This court has found that racketeering activity that spanned seventeen months did not constitute a substantial period of time. <i>See </i><i>Vemco, Inc. v. Camardella,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"669116\"><a href=\"/opinion/669116/vemco-inc-v-john-camardella/\"><span class=\"volume\">23</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">129</span></a></span>, 134 (6th Cir.1994) (finding that allegations of four predicate acts, affecting one victim and spanning seventeen months, were insufficient to meet the continuity requirement). In this case, the predicate acts of racketeering activity spanned less than two monthsJanuary and February 2006and thus do not meet the requirements for close-ended continuity.</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs can, however, establish open-ended continuity. \"Often a RICO action will be brought before continuity can be established [by showing predicate acts spanning a substantial period of time]. In such cases, liability depends on whether the <i>threat</i> of continuity is demonstrated.\" <i>H.J. Inc.,</i> 492 U.S. at 242, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112323\"><a href=\"/opinion/112323/hj-inc-v-northwestern-bell-telephone-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2893</span></a></span>. So the plaintiffs must plausibly allege that there was a threat of continuing criminal activity beyond the period during which the predicate acts were performed. Determining whether the predicate acts establish open-ended continuity requires a court to examine the specific facts of the case. <i>Id.</i> The threat of continuing racketeering activity need not be established, however, exclusively by reference to the predicate acts alone; rather, a court should consider the totality of the circumstances surrounding the commission of those acts. <i>Brown,</i> 546 F.3d at 355.</p>\n<p>The defendants argue that because Waiting Angels was shut down as part of the criminal prosecution of the individual defendants, the enterprise currently poses no threat of facilitating continued criminal activity, and the plaintiffs, therefore, cannot establish open-ended continuity. Subsequent events are irrelevant to the continuity determination, however, because \"in the context of an open-ended period of racketeering activity, the threat of continuity must be viewed at the time the racketeering activity occurred.\" <i>United States v. Busacca,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"563260\"><a href=\"/opinion/563260/united-states-v-salvatore-t-sam-busacca/\"><span class=\"volume\">936</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">232</span></a></span>, 238 (6th Cir.1991). \"The lack of a threat of continuity of racketeering activity cannot be asserted merely by showing a fortuitous interruption of that activity such as by an arrest, indictment or guilty verdict.\" <i>Id.; see also </i><i>Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Michigan v. Kamin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"524317\"><a href=\"/opinion/524317/blue-cross-and-blue-shield-of-michigan-a-michigan-non-profit-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">876</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">543</span></a></span>, 545 (6th Cir.1989) (finding that continuity was established because, if the defendant had not been caught, there was no reason to believe he would not still be submitting fraudulent insurance claims); <i>Moon v. Harrison Piping Supply,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">465</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">719</span></span>, 729 (6th Cir.2006) (Moore, J., concurring) (stating that the court should not consider events that transpired after the alleged racketeering acts ended when determining whether a threat of long-term racketeering activity has been properly alleged).</p>\n<p>Moreover, the complaint does not allege an inherently terminable schemea pattern of racketeering activity with a built-in ending pointthat has prevented this court from finding open-ended continuity in the past. <i>Vemco,</i> 23 F.3d at 134 (finding no open-ended continuity where only a single scheme to defraud one plaintiff the cost of one paint system was pled); <i>Vild v. Visconsi,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"577703\"><a href=\"/opinion/577703/john-vild-cross-appellee-v-dominic-a-visconsi-patricia-sattenfield/\"><span class=\"volume\">956</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">560</span></a></span>, 569 (6th Cir.1992) (finding the plaintiff had failed to plead <span class=\"star-pagination\">*411</span> open-ended continuity when \"the acts alleged amount[ed] at best to a breach of contract with a single customer\"); <i>Thompson v. Paasche,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"572700\"><a href=\"/opinion/572700/kenneth-rm-thompson-kenneth-rm-thompson-pc-kenneth-rm-thompson/\"><span class=\"volume\">950</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">306</span></a></span>, 311 (6th Cir.1991) (finding that there was no open-ended continuity because the defendant's fraudulent scheme to sell nineteen lots of land was \"an inherently short-term affair\" that would end once the lots were sold). Here, there is no inherent limit to the number of couples seeking to adopt or to the number of children that the defendants could hold out as available for adoption.</p>\n<p>At the time that the defendants committed the four predicate acts alleged here, there was no indication that their pattern of behavior would not continue indefinitely into the future. The plaintiffs have thus adequately alleged a threat of continuing criminal activity and, therefore, have sufficiently alleged a pattern of racketeering activity.<sup>[2]</sup><i>See </i><i>Busacca,</i> 936 F.2d at 237-38 (finding that six predicate acts committed in a span of two-and-a-half months was sufficient to establish open-ended continuity when the manner in which the racketeering activity occurred was capable of repetition indefinitely into the future). Accordingly, because the plaintiffs have adequately alleged conduct of an enterprise committed through a pattern of racketeering activity, <i>Sedima,</i> 473 U.S. at 496, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111508\"><a href=\"/opinion/111508/sedima-sp-rl-v-imrex-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">3275</span></a></span>, we find that the third amended complaint does state a claim upon which relief can be granted under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). Dismissal of this claim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) was improper.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>The plaintiffs also challenge the dismissal of their RICO conspiracy claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d). To plausibly state a claim for a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d), plaintiffs must successfully allege all the elements of a RICO violation, as well as alleging \"the existence of an illicit agreement to violate the substantive RICO provision.\" <i>United States v. Sinito,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">723</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1250</span></span>, 1260 (6th Cir. 1983). \"An agreement can be shown if the defendant objectively manifested an agreement to participate directly or indirectly in the affairs of an enterprise through the commission of two or more predicate crimes.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1261 (internal quotation and editing marks omitted). The plaintiffs' third amended complaint does allege that Boraggina and Beauvais conspired to conduct the affairs of Waiting Angels through a pattern of racketeering activity, and this agreement can be inferred from the individual defendants' involvement in the four well-pled predicate acts in which they made false representations to hopeful adoptive couples with the goal of defrauding those couples of money. Because the plaintiffs have adequately alleged both an underlying RICO violation and an agreement to participate in this violation, we find that the third amended complaint does state a claim upon which relief can be granted under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d). Dismissal of this claim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) was also improper.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV.</h2>\n<p>For the reasons provided above, we reverse the district court's judgment that dismissed the plaintiffs' RICO claims <span class=\"star-pagination\">*412</span> brought under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) and (d), and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  The Honorable John R. Adams, United States District Judge for the Northern District of Ohio, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  The district court mistakenly stated that the date of the Wrights' claim for fraudulent inducement of the payment of foster care expenses was September 2005. The Wrights allege that they entered into two contracts and made payments to Waiting Angels for two different children, one in September 2005 and one in January 2006. The claim involving foster care fees arose out the contract for baby Estafany, entered into in January 2006.</p>\n<p>[2]  The plaintiffs also allege that the predicate acts represented the defendants' \"regular way of conducting [their] on-going business activities,\" which is another way to establish open-ended continuity. <i>H.J. Inc.,</i> 492 U.S. at 243, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112323\"><a href=\"/opinion/112323/hj-inc-v-northwestern-bell-telephone-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2893</span></a></span>. Because we have found that the four predicate acts sufficiently demonstrate an ongoing threat of racketeering activity, we need not decide the issue of whether the plaintiffs have included sufficient factual matter in their third amended complaint to find that this allegation is well-pled and not merely conclusory.</p>\n\n</div>",
