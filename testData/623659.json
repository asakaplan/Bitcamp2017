Rufus Robinson pled guilty to knowingly possessing\nover 7100 images of child pornography on his computer.

Sargus, Jr., United States District Judge for the Southern District of\nOhio, sitting by designation.\n\n\n                                                   1\n\fNo. 09-1959        United States v. Robinson                                      Page 2\n\n\nGuidelines, Robinson’s recommended sentence was 78 to 97 months’ imprisonment.\nThe district court rejected that recommendation and imposed a sentence of one day in\ncustody, a term of supervised release of five years, and a $100 special assessment. The\nUnited States contends that Robinson’s sentence is both procedurally and substantively\nunreasonable. We agree that the sentence is substantively unreasonable, and vacate his\nsentence.\n\n                                 I. BACKGROUND\n\n       In April 2006, Robinson subscribed to an online website which allowed him, for\na fee, to access large amounts of child pornography. Robinson used a credit card and\npaid a fee to subscribe to the site. As part of a national investigation, agents from the\nBureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”) later identified the website\nas a pay-for-subscription child pornography website. ICE agents gathered the credit card\ninformation for the subscribers of the site, including Robinson.\n\n       In October 2007, ICE agents came to Robinson’s home and informed him that\nhe was suspected of possessing child pornography. Robinson permitted the agents to\nconduct a forensic preview as well as a full examination of both computers located in his\nresidence. He told the agents that he lived alone and was the only person with access to\nthe computers. Between the two computers and a collection of CDs and DVDs, agents\nfound over 7100 images of child pornography. Some of the images involved the\nbondage, torture, and rape of prepubescent children.\n\n       Robinson later pled guilty without a plea agreement to one count of possession\nof child pornography in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2252A(a)(5)(B). In calculating the\napplicable Sentencing Guidelines range, the parties agreed that the U.S. Probation Office\nhad correctly determined, under U.S.S.G. § 2G2.2(a)(1), that Robinson’s base offense\nlevel was 18. Two levels were added because the material depicted prepubescent\njuveniles; four levels were added because the material portrayed sadomasochistic or\nviolent content; two levels were added for the use of a computer; and five levels were\nadded because the offense involved more than 600 images. This netted to an offense\nlevel of 31, which was reduced by three levels for Robinson’s acceptance of\n\fNo. 09-1959        United States v. Robinson                                      Page 3\n\n\nresponsibility. Robinson had no significant criminal record and scored no criminal\nhistory points, which placed him in Criminal History Category I. Robinson’s adjusted\noffense level was 28, which, with a criminal history category of I, resulted in a\nguidelines range of 78 to 97 months. The Presentence Report (“PSR”) recommended\na sentence within the guidelines range. Neither Robinson nor the government objected\nto the PSR.\n\n       Prior to sentencing, Robinson was examined by Dr. Dennis P. Sugrue, a\npsychologist. In a narrative report (“Report”), Dr. Sugrue described in detail Robinson’s\npsychological condition, reported the results of three psychometric tests, and rendered\na series of conclusions and opinions. The first psychometric finding reported the results\nof a Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory-III (“MCMI III”). The MCMI III is “designed\nto identify both acute and characterological psychiatric conditions.” (Report at 6.) Dr.\nSugrue concluded from the MCMI III that Robinson did not suffer from “antisocial or\nsociopathic tendencies.” (Id.)\n\n       The second test, Multiphasic Sex Inventory II—Adult Male Form (“MSI II”), is\ndesigned to measure the sexual characteristics of an adult male sex offender. From an\nexamination of Robinson’s responses, Dr. Sugrue found that Robinson was not addicted\nto pornography, and either did not or could not “acknowledge ever having had sexual\nfantasies or desire involving children that would lead him to seek child pornography.\nHe nevertheless acknowledges having sought and obtained pornography involving\nchildren.” (Report at 7.)\n\n       The third test, STATIC-99, is designed to assist in the prediction of sexual and\nviolent recidivism for sexual offenders. The test produces estimates of future risk based\nupon the number of risk factors present in any one individual, primarily measuring prior\nsex offenses or crimes of violence. As Dr. Sugrue notes, “the STATIC-99 and most\nother risk assessment scales have not been normed for individuals possessing child\npornography.” (Report at 8.) Dr. Sugrue found that “Robinson scored in the lowest risk\ncategory relative to other adult male sex offenders.” (Id.)\n\fNo. 09-1959         United States v. Robinson                                      Page 4\n\n\n        Incorporating the results of the three tests into a conclusive summary, Dr. Sugrue\nnoted that Robinson did not appear to be a pedophile. The conclusions offered by Dr.\nSugrue, however, related solely to the question of whether Robinson is a pedophile and\nwhether he is likely to sexually abuse a child, a crime for which he was not charged. Dr.\nSugrue concluded that, to date, the only scientifically valid method of determining the\nrisk of new offenses involving child sex offenses is based upon the presence of prior,\nsimilar offenses. Based on Robinson’s testing failure to show evidence of an antisocial\npersonality, his lack of criminal history, and scoring in the lowest risk category, Dr.\nSugrue stated that “[o]ffenders who score in the low range of risk assessment inventories\nare generally considered appropriate for community supervision and treatment.” (Report\nat 10.) In addition, Dr. Sugrue did not conclude that Robinson suffered from any\nsignificant mental health disorder.\n\n        At sentencing, Robinson’s counsel urged the district court to vary from the\nguidelines range and consider a lengthy probationary term. Robinson’s counsel asked\nthe district court to consider that, per the report of Dr. Sugrue, Robinson was neither\ndangerous nor a predator. Further, Robinson’s counsel requested the court take into\naccount Robinson’s initial cooperation with investigating agents, his lack of criminal\nhistory, his attendance at counseling, and his painful, debilitating back condition. The\ngovernment requested a sentence within the guidelines range, emphasizing that Robinson\nand others created a market for child pornography. In its sentencing memorandum, the\ngovernment asserted that the willingness of Robinson to pay a subscription to a child\npornography website provided direct financial incentive to producers of such materials\nand could have led to the abuse of actual children.\n\n        The district court began by correctly calculating the sentencing guidelines range.\nIt then reviewed in considerable detail the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C.\n§ 3553(a). The court noted that Robinson had no criminal history points, was in need\nof continued counseling, and would be categorized as a felon for the rest of his life. The\ndistrict court then stated:\n\fNo. 09-1959        United States v. Robinson                                       Page 5\n\n\n       And obviously dangerousness is a factor. And for the reasons that I have\n       concluded that you’re going to be deterred by the fact that you have a\n       felony conviction and have gone through this experience, it also leads me\n       to the conclusion you’re not going to be dangerous to anybody. And\n       that’s supported by what I consider to be a very comprehensive report\n       attached to the Sentencing Memorandum, the psychological report.\n\n(R. 25 at 16.) The district court further noted:\n\n       And now I’m going to refer to what has been marked as Exhibit B, which\n       is a psychological evaluation of Rufus R. Robinson—that is you—that’s\n       dated September 26th of 2008. And I’m not going to read the entire\n       thing. I am going to summarize.\n       The things I’m going to summarize include that you were given what the\n       writer refers to as psychometric findings. In other words, you were given\n       objective tests that are recognized in the field to predict as best as\n       anything can or to evaluate your dangerousness. And the writer found\n       that: “It is important to note that there was no evidence on Mr.\n       Robinson’s MCMI profile to suggest the presence of antisocial or\n       sociopathic tendencies.” MCMI stands for Millon Clinical Multiaxial\n       Inventory III. That’s the third part of it.\n       And they did another test or another set of inventory questions that show\n       that you weren’t deceiving or lying on the test. They are control\n       questions. And it goes in great detail. And because of the detail of this\n       report and because I’m including it in the record, I’m going to seal this\n       transcript for obvious reasons—well, for the same reasons I sealed the\n       presentence memorandum for the Defendant. And overall the\n       conclusion—and this is at page eight. “On the STATIC-99, Mr.\n       Robinson scored in the low risk category relevant to other adult male sex\n       offenders. Offenders who score in this low range are generally\n       considered appropriate for community supervision and treatment.”\n       And then, finally, in the writer’s conclusions and recommendations at\n       pages 9 and 10, it includes a conclusion that you’re not a pedophile and\n       gives the reasons of—gives his reasons of how he got to that conclusion.\n       And, therefore, I am comfortable in varying to the degree that I’m\n       varying.\n\n(R. 25 at 23–25.) Finally, the court concluded:\n\n       But I think the important part of the report is the answer to the first\n       question posed by the writer, which was is he a pedophile or not. And\n       the conclusion was, not.\n\fNo. 09-1959         United States v. Robinson                                         Page 6\n\n\n(R. 25 at 26.) The district court also stated that “this court believes that the Defendant\nwill not benefit from incarceration,” “[h]e has voluntarily sought counseling,” and “he\ndoes not render any recidivism factors for future behavior with children.” (R. 25 at 23.)\nThe court then contrasted possession of child pornography with some related\noffenses—such as its production and distribution—that the court regarded as more\nserious. The court also emphasized Robinson’s employment history, attitude, age, and\nagain reiterated his lack of significant criminal history.\n\n        The district court then sentenced Robinson to one day of imprisonment, with\ncredit for time already served, followed by a period of supervised release for five years,\nand a $100 special assessment. The terms of supervised release contained no significant\nspecial conditions. The government immediately objected to the court’s downward\nvariance. It then brought this appeal.\n\n                                     II. DISCUSSION\n\n        On appeal, the government contends that Robinson’s one-day sentence was\nunreasonable on two grounds. First, the government contends that the sentence imposed\nwas procedurally unreasonable because the district court committed several factual\nerrors at the sentencing hearing. Most importantly, the government contends the district\ncourt mischaracterized the conclusions of the psychological report. Second, the\ngovernment contends that the sentence imposed was substantively unreasonable because\nthe district court failed to consider several of the § 3553(a) factors relevant to this case.\nThe parties also dispute whether our review should be for an abuse of discretion as to\nreasonableness or for plain error.\n\n        The scope and extent of our review was explained in United States v. Booker,\n543 U.S. 220, 260–262 (2005). Booker invalidated that portion of the Sentencing\nReform Act which, under 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b)(1), directed the courts of appeals to apply\na de novo standard of review to sentences outside the Sentencing Guidelines. Id.\nFurther, the Court held that the standard of review is one of reasonableness, as to\nwhether the sentence imposed was an abuse of discretion.\n\fNo. 09-1959         United States v. Robinson                                         Page 7\n\n\n        Following Booker, three subsequent Supreme Court opinions, decided on the\nsame day, have given additional guidance as to the scope of review applicable to both\nguidelines and non-guidelines sentences. Gall v. United States, 552 U.S. 38 (2007);\nKimbrough v. United States, 552 U.S. 85 (2007); Rita v. United States, 551 U.S. 338\n(2007). In Gall, the Court held that a sentencing judge “must explain his conclusion that\nan unusually lenient or an unusually harsh sentence is appropriate in a particular case\nwith sufficient justifications.” 552 U.S. at 46. The Court rejected, however, “an\nappellate rule that requires ‘extraordinary’ circumstances to justify a sentence outside\nthe Guidelines range.” Id. at 47. The Court reasoned that if a district court decides to\nimpose a sentence outside the applicable guidelines range, the court must “ensure that\nthe justification is sufficiently compelling to support the degree of the variance. We find\nit uncontroversial that a major departure should be supported by a more significant\njustification than a minor one. After settling on the appropriate sentence, [a district court\njudge] must adequately explain the chosen sentence to allow for meaningful appellate\nreview and to promote the perception of fair sentencing.” Id. at 50.\n\n        In defining the standard of appellate review post-Booker, the Supreme Court\nmade clear that the courts of appeals retained an important role. In Rita, the Court\nemphasized “[i]n sentencing, as in other areas, district judges at times make mistakes\nthat are substantive. . . . Circuit courts exist to correct such mistakes when they occur.”\n551 U.S. at 354. However, we must keep in mind that “the clear, overriding import of\n[Rita, Kimbrough, and Gall] is that appellate courts must respect the role of district\ncourts and stop substituting their judgment for that of those courts on the front line.”\nUnited States v. Phinazee, 515 F.3d 511, 521 (6th Cir. 2008).\n\n        It is hardly controversial to say that appellate courts have struggled in applying\nthe principles enunciated in Rita, Gall, and Kimbrough.            Appellate courts have\nparticularly struggled in review of possession of child pornography cases, where\n\fNo. 09-1959           United States v. Robinson                                              Page 8\n\n\nvariances occur in 60% of cases according to the Sentencing Commission’s 2010\nSourcebook of Federal Sentencing Statistics.1\n\n        Regardless of whether the sentence imposed is inside or outside of the guidelines\nrange, an appellate court must use an abuse-of-discretion standard to assess whether a\nsentence is reasonable. Gall, 552 U.S. at 51. As explained in Rita, a presumption of\nreasonableness applies to a sentence within the guidelines; no such presumption applies\nto a sentence reflecting a variance from the guidelines. 551 U.S. at 355–56. Here, no\npresumption of reasonableness applies because the sentence imposed by the district court\nvaried downward to an essentially non-custodial sentence.\n\n        If a party fails to object to the sentence below, we review for plain error. United\nStates v. Vonner, 516 F.3d 382, 385–86 (6th Cir. 2008) (en banc). For plain error review\nto apply, a party must have had an opportunity to raise the objection below. Id. Here,\nthe government objected to the sentence at the time it was imposed. (R. 25 at 30.)\nAccordingly, we review the district court’s sentence under an abuse-of-discretion\nstandard as to reasonableness, which has both a procedural and substantive component.\nGall, 552 U.S. at 51.\n\nA. Procedural Reasonableness\n\n        Initially, we “must first ensure that the district court committed no significant\nprocedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines\nrange, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the § 3553(a) factors,\nselecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the\nchosen sentence.” Gall, 552 U.S. at 51. In particular, “[t]he sentencing judge should set\nforth enough to satisfy the appellate court that he [or she] has considered the parties’\n\n\n\n        1\n         See U.S.S.C., 2010 Sourcebook of Federal Sentencing Statistics, Table 28: Sentences Relative\nto the Guideline Range By Each Primary Sentencing Guideline; § 2G2.2 (Fiscal Year 2010) (“2010\nSourcebook”). In fiscal year 2010, the non-government sponsored below-guideline rate was 44.6%, the\ngovernment sponsored below-guideline rate was 13.5%, and the above-guideline rate was 2.0%. Id. By\ncomparison, for all offenders, the non-government sponsored below-guideline rate was 17.8%, the\ngovernment sponsored below-guideline rate was 25.4%, and the above-guideline rate was 1.8%. 2010\nSourcebook, Table N: National Comparison of Sentence Imposed and Position Relative to the Guideline\nRange.\n\fNo. 09-1959        United States v. Robinson                                     Page 9\n\n\narguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising his own legal decisionmaking\nauthority.” Rita, 551 U.S. at 356.\n\n       The government contends that the district court fashioned its sentence based on\nthree clearly erroneous facts: (1) most importantly, mischaracterizing the conclusions\nof Dr. Sugrue’s psychological report and concluding that Robinson was not a pedophile;\n(2) mischaracterizing Robinson’s criminal intent; and (3) wrongly claiming that the\ngovernment had not previously prosecuted a collector of child pornography unless the\nperson had a prior rape conviction. The government asserts that these factual errors,\nwhich drove the court’s sentencing decision, rendered the sentence imposed procedurally\nunreasonable.\n\n       The government first contends that the district court mischaracterized the\npsychological report. During the sentencing hearing, the district court reviewed the\npsychological report rendered by Dr. Sugrue and concluded that “the important part of\nthe report is the answer to the first question . . . is he a pedophile or not. And the\nconclusion was, not.” (R. 25 at 26.) The government contends that the district court\nmisconstrued the report because Dr. Sugrue never explicitly stated that Robinson was\nnot a pedophile; rather, the report stated that “[o]n the STATIC-99, Mr. Robinson scored\nin the low risk category relevant to other adult male sex offenders.” (Report at 8.)\nWhile the government is correct that Dr. Sugrue’s report did not explicitly state that\nRobinson was not a pedophile, the report is subject to varying interpretations. We\ncannot say that the district court’s reliance on its interpretation of the psychological\nreport rises to the level of being clearly erroneous.\n\n       The government next contends that the district court mischaracterized\nRobinson’s criminal intent by stating at the hearing, “most people, yourself included,\ndon’t think that by purchasing something online that’s available is necessarily a crime.\nOtherwise, nobody would use their credit cards to do it and nobody would use their\nhome computer to do it.” (R. 25 at 15.) We find this argument unavailing. Robinson\ndid not need to know that possession of child pornography was a crime; he only needed\n\fNo. 09-1959         United States v. Robinson                                    Page 10\n\n\nto know that that he was in possession of child pornography.             See 18 U.S.C.\n§ 2252A(a)(5)(B).\n\n       Also unavailing is the government’s third contention that the district court\nattempted to diminish the significance of Robinson’s criminal conduct by wrongly\nclaiming that the government had previously only prosecuted possessors of child\npornography who had a prior conviction for rape. Specifically, the district court stated,\n“when [the government] first started bringing these cases, the one thing they had in\ncommon with each other, but not with this case, is the person, if they were in their\nforties, had a prior sexual conviction in state court generally, either statutory rape or\nstraight out rape, what’s called CSC 1.” (R. 25 at 17.) When put into context, however,\nthe court made this comment when speaking to the dangerousness to the community of\nthese types of offenders. The court was merely remarking that it personally noticed that\nthe first wave of prosecutions for possession of child pornography seemed to involve\noffenders with prior rape convictions.\n\n       Despite the remarks made by the district court and its interpretation of the\npsychological report, the factual findings on which it based its sentence were not clearly\nerroneous. In short, we find the sentence imposed to be procedurally reasonable.\n\nB. Substantive Reasonableness\n\n       We next consider whether Robinson’s sentence was substantively reasonable in\nlight of the sentencing factors recited in § 3553(a). “A sentence may be considered\nsubstantively unreasonable when the district court selects a sentence arbitrarily, bases\nthe sentence on impermissible factors, fails to consider relevant sentencing factors, or\ngives an unreasonable amount of weight to any pertinent factor.” United States v.\nConatser, 514 F.3d 508, 520 (6th Cir. 2008). The government contends that the district\ncourt failed to consider several § 3553(a) factors relevant to the crime—including the\nneed for the sentence to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the\nlaw, and to provide just punishment—and instead placed unreasonable weight on factors\nrelated to Robinson’s likelihood of recidivism and whether he was a pedophile. The\n\fNo. 09-1959         United States v. Robinson                                     Page 11\n\n\ngovernment also contends that the district court did not adequately consider the need to\navoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants convicted of similar conduct.\n\n        The district court granted a 78-month downward variance from the low end of\nthe guidelines range. While we do not use any form of strict proportionality review,\nUnited States v. Bolds, 511 F.3d 568, 580–81 (6th Cir. 2007), the greater the district\ncourt’s variance, the more compelling the evidence must be. See Gall, 552 U.S. at 50\n(“We find it uncontroversial that a major departure should be supported by a more\nsignificant justification than a minor one.”); United States v. Grossman, 513 F.3d 592,\n596 (6th Cir. 2008) (holding that it is not improper to “require some correlation between\nthe extent of a variance and the justification for it”).\n\n        In justifying its downward variance, the district court granted leniency based\nprimarily on the characteristics of the offender. The district court placed substantial\nweight on Robinson’s psychological evaluation, interpreting Dr. Sugrue’s report to\nconclude that Robinson was not dangerous and not a pedophile. Relying heavily on that\nconclusion, the district court judge made the following statements: “[h]e does not render\nany recidivism factors for future behavior with children,” “I’m convinced you’re not\ngoing to do that again,” “[a]nd, therefore, I am comfortable in varying to the degree that\nI’m varying.” (R. 25 at 23, 25, 31.)\n\n        While the district court thoroughly considered the “history and characteristics of\nthe defendant[,]” see § 3553(a)(1), and “the need for the sentence imposed . . . to protect\nthe public from further crimes of the defendant[,]” see § 3553(a)(2)(C), the sentence\nimposed must do more. The sentence was based, in large part, on a prediction of future\nconduct concerning a particular type of crime that was not at issue in this case. The\ncrime of conviction in this case was possession of child pornography, not sexual abuse\nof a child.\n\n        The district court also emphasized Robinson’s employment history, age, and\ndebilitating back condition. Although the guidelines discourage consideration of these\nfactors, Booker renders the guidelines advisory. See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual\n§§ 5H1.1, 5H1.4, 5H1.5 (2011). Thus, while a district court may consider such factors\n\fNo. 09-1959            United States v. Robinson                                                   Page 12\n\n\nin deciding whether a variance is warranted and in determining the extent of any\nvariance, it should take into account “the ‘discouraged’ status of these factors.” United\nStates v. Borho, 485 F.3d 904, 913 (6th Cir. 2007).\n\n         The district court also may not disregard the other § 3553(a) factors. The\n§3553(a) factors also require the district court to consider “the need for the sentence\nimposed—to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and\nto provide just punishment for the offense[,]” see § 3553(a)(2)(A), “to afford adequate\ndeterrence to criminal conduct[,]” see § 3553(a)(2)(B), and “to avoid unwarranted\nsentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty\nof similar conduct[,]” see § 3553(a)(6). The lack of weight given to these other factors\nrenders the sentence in this case substantively unreasonable.\n\n                                   1. Seriousness of the Offense\n\n         Prominent among the § 3553(a) factors is the “need for the sentence imposed . . .\nto reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide\njust punishment for the offense.” In this case, the offense is knowing possession of child\npornography in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2252A(a)(5)(B).\n\n         The sentence does not reflect the seriousness of this offense. Child pornography\nis, without qualification, a serious crime. Robinson’s specific conduct in possessing\nover 7100 images of child pornography was unquestionably serious. Some of the images\ninvolved the bondage, torture, and rape of prepubescent children. Further, Robinson did\nnot just possess images—he subscribed to a child pornography website and paid a fee\nfor images.2 The guidelines range reflected all of these considerations by adding thirteen\npoints to Robinson’s guidelines score.                  The district court did not address the\nenhancements which were applied in computing the guidelines range. Nor did it explain\n         2\n           The fact that Robinson paid money to a website could have justified a charge of receiving child\npornography under 18 U.S.C. § 2252A(a)(2). This section defines distribution or receipt of child\npornography as the same crime and imposes a mandatory five-year minimum sentence. In many cases,\nthe distinction between possessing child pornography (which carries no mandatory minimum) and\nreceiving child pornography (which carries the five-year mandatory minimum) is nonexistent. But paying\na service for providing child pornography is qualitatively different than file sharing. We note that standing\nalone, the current statutory scheme makes no principled distinction between possessing and receiving child\npornography, which can often times be virtually identical conduct, but nonetheless results in vastly\ndifferent mandatory sentencing ranges.\n\fNo. 09-1959         United States v. Robinson                                       Page 13\n\n\nwhy Robinson’s lack of a significant criminal record justified a major variance from the\nsentence recommended by the guidelines.\n\n        The district court also stated that “everyone would agree that especially if you’re\nan organizer and a creator of this kind of material, a very severe sentence is warranted,”\nand “the most time [i.e., severe sentences] should go to the creators; the next most time\nto the distributors and/or possessors who may be prone to commit sexual offenses\nagainst children.” (R. 25 at 18, 22.) We do not disagree with these statements.\nHowever, “[t]hat the producers of child pornography are more culpable . . . does not\nmean that its knowing and deliberate possessors are barely culpable at all.” United\nStates v. Bistline, 665 F.3d 758, 765 (6th Cir. 2012). Robinson knowingly acquired the\nimages affirmatively, deliberately, and repeatedly, hundreds of times over the course of\nfive years.\n\n        The district court’s sentence, however, did not adequately reflect that fact. Nor\ndid the sentence itself reflect the seriousness of his crime, promote respect for the law,\nor provide just punishment for his offense.\n\n                                      2. Deterrence\n\n        Another § 3553(a) factor is “the need for the sentence imposed . . . to afford\nadequate deterrence to criminal conduct[.]” 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2)(B). The district\ncourt thought that factor was satisfied here because “this is a sex offense . . . [making it]\nnecessary for [Robinson] to register as a sex offender, which, by the way, is another\nelement of deterrence both for you and for everybody else. Nobody wants to be on a list\nlike that.” (R. 25 at 29.) The district court also noted that “[t]o the limited extent that\nanyone knows about [Robinson’s] arrest, that’s deterrence”; and “the fact that [Robinson\nwas] caught and that gets out into the community, that will deter some other people”;\nand “sometimes the Government issues a press release . . . [a]nd three or 400 more\npeople may read it or a thousand people, and some of those people might not do that\nconduct because they know . . . it’s a felony conviction”; and “nothing I say here today\nwill take out the fact that for the rest of your life – you’re 43 years old – you have a\n\fNo. 09-1959          United States v. Robinson                                    Page 14\n\n\nfelony conviction: And that will deter people. And it will especially deter you.” (R. 25\nat 15.)\n\n          However, these consequences do not arise from Robinson’s sentence. Rather,\nthey arise from his prosecution and conviction. Section 3553(a)(2)(B) plainly states that\n“the sentence imposed” should “afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct”\n(emphasis added). This is not reflected in Robinson’s sentence. We have previously\nheld that, under § 3553(a)(2)(B) and (C), deterring future criminal behavior and\nprotecting the public as sentencing factors in a child pornography case should be focused\nupon the market for such activities. The emphasis should be upon deterring the\nproduction, distribution, receipt, or possession of child pornography, and not a prediction\nof future sexual contact with children. See United States v. Christman, 607 F.3d 1110,\n1122–23 (6th Cir. 2010). General deterrence is crucial in the child pornography context,\nas the Seventh Circuit has explained:\n\n          Young children were raped in order to enable the production of the\n          pornography that the defendant both downloaded and uploaded . . . . The\n          greater the customer demand for child pornography, the more that will\n          be produced. Sentences influence behavior, or so at least Congress\n          thought when in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) it made deterrence a statutory\n          sentencing factor. The logic of deterrence suggests that the lighter the\n          punishment for downloading and uploading child pornography, the\n          greater the customer demand for it and so the more will be produced.\n\nUnited States v. Goldberg, 491 F.3d 668, 672 (7th Cir. 2007) (citations omitted); see\nalso United States v. Goff, 501 F.3d 250, 261 (3d Cir. 2007) (“[D]eterring the production\nof child pornography and protecting the children who are victimized by it are factors that\nshould have been given significant weight at sentencing, but in fact received not a word\nfrom the District Court.”).\n\n          Robinson’s sentence, which was devoid of any significant period of\nincarceration, home confinement, or substantial fine, undermines the purpose of general\ndeterrence. As deterrence has both an individualized and more general component,\nparticularly in the child pornography context, we do not see how Robinson’s sentence\nwould meaningfully deter anyone else.\n\fNo. 09-1959           United States v. Robinson                                       Page 15\n\n\n                                   3. Sentence Disparities\n\n          Another factor is “the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among\ndefendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct[.]”\n18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(6). The sentencing guidelines already take into consideration\nRobinson’s lack of significant criminal history and specific conduct in violating\n18 U.S.C. § 2252A(a)(5)(B).           Yet his guidelines range was 78 to 97 months’\nimprisonment. As we articulated in Bistline, “[w]e do not mean to imply that only a\nsentence in or around that range will avoid disparities with other similar defendants. But\nwe do not see how the sentence imposed here avoids them.” 665 F.3d at 767.\n\n          At the sentencing hearing, the district court discussed several cases in which the\nSixth Circuit affirmed sentences in child pornography cases that significantly varied\nfrom the guidelines. (R. 25 at 18–23.) The court noted that the cases involved\n“distinguishing characteristics as to each individual” and the decisions were\n“distinguishable because the individual[s] involved [were] much more active in either\ncreating or distributing the material.” (R. 25 at 16, 21.) However, as we have stated\nbefore:\n\n          [It] is not logical to justify a more lenient sentence on the basis that [the\n          defendant] did not make or distribute child pornography or molest a\n          child. Just as the federal sentencing laws impose greater sentences upon\n          sellers of controlled substances than upon those who are caught\n          possessing such substances . . . the federal child sexual offense laws do\n          so as well. Indeed, the Sentencing Guidelines take into account only the\n          criminal conduct of which [the defendant] was charged.\n\nUnited States v. Camiscione, 591 F.3d 823, 834 (6th Cir. 2010).\n\n          We note that the sentencing guidelines relating to child pornography have\ngenerated much controversy and are currently under review by the Sentencing\nCommission. This case is grimly typical in a number of aspects which enhanced the\noffense level under the guidelines. Robinson was assessed two extra levels for use of\na computer, which now occurs in almost every case. Enhancements to the base offense\nlevel are meant to increase a sentence for conduct more aggravated than the typical type\n\fNo. 09-1959            United States v. Robinson                                                 Page 16\n\n\nof offense, making this guideline an anomaly. In Robinson’s case, he was assessed six\nadditional levels because the visual conduct included depictions of prepubescent children\nbeing subjected to rape and sadomasochistic or violent conduct. These enhancements\nhave received far less criticism than that of using a computer.\n\n         Perhaps the most criticized enhancement involves the number of child\npornography images possessed by a defendant. In this case, Robinson was assessed five\nlevels because the offense involved more than 600 images. In a number of offense\nguidelines, amounts involved in criminal conduct are used to adjust the guidelines range\nby adding points to the base offense level; e.g., drug quantities in § 2D1.1, amount of\nloss in § 2B1.1; number of firearms in § 2K2.1. See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual\n§§ 2D1.1, 2B1.1, 2K2.1 (2011). In many cases, the extent and degree of criminal\nconduct bears a relationship to such quantifiable measurements.3\n\n         In the computer age, we have some doubt that the number of pictures alone\ncaptures the gravity of the crime of possession of child pornography. A defendant who\nknowingly shares files containing child pornography does not necessarily know the\nnumber to be received. A saver of files, who has viewed and traded as many images as\na non-saver of files, is subjected to a far greater sentencing guidelines range.\n\n         These issues bear upon the facts in this case. While this Court is not tasked with\ncrafting sentencing guidelines or randomly critiquing the work of the Sentencing\nCommission, it is noteworthy that Robinson acquired a large number of images of child\npornography over a five-year period. This fact seems much more appropriate to a\nsentencing enhancement under the guidelines than a large number of images, all of\nwhich could have been downloaded on a single day. Robinson paid money for some of\nthe images and engaged in the criminal conduct over a long period of time, all of which\nare factors to be considered at sentencing. In sum, while aspects of the sentencing\nguidelines for child pornography have generated substantial controversy, two\n\n         3\n           In many cases, the opposite may be true. In the case of a low level drug carrier who cannot\naccess the trunk where the drugs are located, the quantity of drugs is not indicative of the gravity of the\ndefendant’s conduct. In many fraud cases, the amount of fraud depends upon fortuity, length of operation,\nor amount available. In other words, more would have been taken in some cases; in others, much smaller\nin scope, good or bad fortune drove the amount.\n\fNo. 09-1959        United States v. Robinson                                      Page 17\n\n\nenhancements particular to this case make the conduct of the defendant more\naggravating.\n\n       We pause to explain why our decision in this case is not controlled by our\ndecisions in United States v. Stall, 581 F.3d 276 (6th Cir. 2009) and United States v.\nPrisel, 316 F. App’x. 377 (6th Cir. 2008), where we considered whether one-day\nsentences of imprisonment for possession of child pornography were substantively\nreasonable. In both cases, we affirmed the sentences under the more stringent plain-error\nstandard of review. The sentences imposed in those cases, however, were more severe\nthan Robinson’s sentence. The sentences in Stall and Prisel imposed very restrictive\nconditions as part of the defendants’ supervised release, as well as significant fines. See\nStall, 581 F.3d at 281 (affirming, under plain-error review, sentence of one day of\nimprisonment, ten years of supervised release, the first year of which was under home\nconfinement, and $5,000 fine for possession of eighteen images of child pornography,\nwhere applicable guidelines range was 57 to 71 months); Prisel, 316 F. App’x. at 380\n(affirming, under plain-error review, sentence of one day of imprisonment, three years\nof supervised release, the first eighteen months of which were under home confinement\nwith electronic monitoring, and a $6,000 fine for possession of 1,189 images and five\ndigital movies containing child pornography, where applicable guidelines range was 27\nto 33 months). Unlike the facts in Stall, here, the district court did not conduct an\n“extensive analysis of how a [five-year] term of supervised release would restrict [the\ndefendant’s] freedom and protect the public” or explain “why the district court believed\nthis sentence will deter similar offenders and why this case warranted a variance.”\n581 F.3d at 287.\n\n       Although the courts in Stall and Prisel rejected the applicable guidelines ranges,\nthey nevertheless sentenced the defendants to lengthy periods of supervised\nrelease—periods of which required home confinement—and substantial fines.\nRobinson’s sentence of one day of imprisonment followed by a five-year term of\nsupervised release under a recommended guidelines range of 78 to 97 months’\n\fNo. 09-1959         United States v. Robinson                                          Page 18\n\n\nimprisonment for possessing 7100 images of child pornography does not begin to\napproach the severity of the sentences imposed in Stall or Prisel.\n\n        Ultimately, the factors that the district court relied on, as articulated in the record,\ndo not justify a variance of this size. Accordingly, we find the variance here to be\nsubstantively unreasonable based on the current record. “[W]e recognize that our\nsubstantive review of sentences is deferential . . . [e]ven so, the sentence in this case can\nwithstand review only if deference amounts to abdication[.]” United States v. Irey,\n612 F.3d 1160, 1165 (11th Cir. 2010) (en banc).\n\n                                   III. CONCLUSION\n\n        We express no view as to an appropriate sentence upon remand to the district\ncourt. Fashioning an appropriate sentence is a most difficult task, particularly in a child\npornography case. We recognize that in some cases there can be very different\ncircumstances for which Booker now compels the district court judge to decide what the\nappropriate sentence may be. The crime of possessing child pornography is difficult to\nunderstand; some cases involve defendants with their own history of sexual abuse as a\nchild, see United States v. Fink, 502 F.3d 585, 587–88 (6th Cir. 2007); others involve\ndefendants with serious mental illness, see United States v. Brooks, 628 F.3d 791,\n794–98 (6th Cir. 2011). To paraphrase Gall, extraordinary circumstances may justify\nextraordinary variances or departures. 552 U.S. at 50. No such circumstances were\nidentified by the district court as it imposed the sentence. We leave it to the district court\nto review all of the relevant facts and § 3553(a) factors to re-craft an appropriate\nsentence.\n\n        For the reasons discussed above, we VACATE Robinson’s sentence and\nREMAND for resentencing in accordance with this opinion.\n\f",

Mulcahy, Assistant United States Attorney, Detroit, Michigan, for Appellant. Kimberly W. Stout, Birmingham, Michigan, for Appellee. ON BRIEF: Kevin M. Mulcahy, Assistant United States Attorney, Detroit, Michigan, for Appellant. Kimberly W. Stout, Birmingham, Michigan, for Appellee.</p>\n<p>Before: COLE and ROGERS, Circuit Judges; SARGUS, District Judge.<sup>[*]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>OPINION</h2>\n<p>SARGUS, District Judge.</p>\n<p>Rufus Robinson pled guilty to knowingly possessing over 7100 images of child pornography on his computer. Some of the images involved the bondage, torture, and rape of prepubescent children. Under the Sentencing Guidelines, Robinson's recommended sentence was 78 to 97 months' imprisonment. The district court rejected that recommendation and imposed a sentence of one day in custody, a term of supervised release of five years, and a $100 special assessment. The United States contends that Robinson's sentence is both procedurally and substantively unreasonable. We agree that the sentence is substantively unreasonable, and vacate his sentence.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>In April 2006, Robinson subscribed to an online website which allowed him, for a fee, to access large amounts of child pornography. Robinson used a credit card and paid a fee to subscribe to the site. As part of a national investigation, agents from the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\") later identified the website as a pay-for-subscription child pornography website. ICE agents gathered the credit card information for the subscribers of the site, including Robinson.</p>\n<p>In October 2007, ICE agents came to Robinson's home and informed him that he was suspected of possessing child pornography. Robinson permitted the agents to conduct a forensic preview as well as a full examination of both computers located in his residence. He told the agents that he lived alone and was the only person with access to the computers. Between the two computers and a collection of CDs and DVDs, agents found over 7100 images of child pornography. Some of the images involved the bondage, torture, and rape of prepubescent children.</p>\n<p>Robinson later pled guilty without a plea agreement to one count of possession of child pornography in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2252A(a)(5)(B). In calculating the applicable Sentencing Guidelines range, the parties agreed that the U.S. Probation Office had correctly determined, under U.S.S.G. § 2G2.2(a)(1), that Robinson's base offense level was 18. Two levels were added because the material depicted prepubescent juveniles; four levels were added because the material portrayed sadomasochistic or violent content; two levels were added for the use of a computer; and five levels were added because the offense involved more than 600 images. This netted to an offense level of 31, which was reduced by three levels for Robinson's acceptance of responsibility. Robinson <span class=\"star-pagination\">*770</span> had no significant criminal record and scored no criminal history points, which placed him in Criminal History Category I. Robinson's adjusted offense level was 28, which, with a criminal history category of I, resulted in a guidelines range of 78 to 97 months. The Presentence Report (\"PSR\") recommended a sentence within the guidelines range. Neither Robinson nor the government objected to the PSR.</p>\n<p>Prior to sentencing, Robinson was examined by Dr. Dennis P. Sugrue, a psychologist. In a narrative report (\"Report\"), Dr. Sugrue described in detail Robinson's psychological condition, reported the results of three psychometric tests, and rendered a series of conclusions and opinions. The first psychometric finding reported the results of a Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory-III (\"MCMI III\"). The MCMI III is \"designed to identify both acute and characterological psychiatric conditions.\" (Report at 6.) Dr. Sugrue concluded from the MCMI III that Robinson did not suffer from \"antisocial or sociopathic tendencies.\" (<i>Id.</i>)</p>\n<p>The second test, Multiphasic Sex Inventory IIAdult Male Form (\"MSI II\"), is designed to measure the sexual characteristics of an adult male sex offender. From an examination of Robinson's responses, Dr. Sugrue found that Robinson was not addicted to pornography, and either did not or could not \"acknowledge ever having had sexual fantasies or desire involving children that would lead him to seek child pornography. He nevertheless acknowledges having sought and obtained pornography involving children.\" (Report at 7.)</p>\n<p>The third test, STATIC-99, is designed to assist in the prediction of sexual and violent recidivism for sexual offenders. The test produces estimates of future risk based upon the number of risk factors present in any one individual, primarily measuring prior sex offenses or crimes of violence. As Dr. Sugrue notes, \"the STATIC-99 and most other risk assessment scales have not been normed for individuals possessing child pornography.\" (Report at 8.) Dr. Sugrue found that \"Robinson scored in the lowest risk category relative to other adult male sex offenders.\" (<i>Id.</i>)</p>\n<p>Incorporating the results of the three tests into a conclusive summary, Dr. Sugrue noted that Robinson did not appear to be a pedophile. The conclusions offered by Dr. Sugrue, however, related solely to the question of whether Robinson is a pedophile and whether he is likely to sexually abuse a child, a crime for which he was not charged. Dr. Sugrue concluded that, to date, the only scientifically valid method of determining the risk of new offenses involving child sex offenses is based upon the presence of prior, similar offenses. Based on Robinson's testing failure to show evidence of an antisocial personality, his lack of criminal history, and scoring in the lowest risk category, Dr. Sugrue stated that \"[o]ffenders who score in the low range of risk assessment inventories are generally considered appropriate for community supervision and treatment.\" (Report at 10.) In addition, Dr. Sugrue did not conclude that Robinson suffered from any significant mental health disorder.</p>\n<p>At sentencing, Robinson's counsel urged the district court to vary from the guidelines range and consider a lengthy probationary term. Robinson's counsel asked the district court to consider that, per the report of Dr. Sugrue, Robinson was neither dangerous nor a predator. Further, Robinson's counsel requested the court take into account Robinson's initial cooperation with investigating agents, his lack of criminal history, his attendance at counseling, and his painful, debilitating back condition. The government requested a sentence within the guidelines range, emphasizing <span class=\"star-pagination\">*771</span> that Robinson and others created a market for child pornography. In its sentencing memorandum, the government asserted that the willingness of Robinson to pay a subscription to a child pornography website provided direct financial incentive to producers of such materials and could have led to the abuse of actual children.</p>\n<p>The district court began by correctly calculating the sentencing guidelines range. It then reviewed in considerable detail the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a). The court noted that Robinson had no criminal history points, was in need of continued counseling, and would be categorized as a felon for the rest of his life. The district court then stated:</p>\n<blockquote>And obviously dangerousness is a factor. And for the reasons that I have concluded that you're going to be deterred by the fact that you have a felony conviction and have gone through this experience, it also leads me to the conclusion you're not going to be dangerous to anybody. And that's supported by what I consider to be a very comprehensive report attached to the Sentencing Memorandum, the psychological report.</blockquote>\n<p>(R. 25 at 16.) The district court further noted:</p>\n<blockquote>And now I'm going to refer to what has been marked as Exhibit B, which is a psychological evaluation of Rufus R. Robinsonthat is youthat's dated September 26th of 2008. And I'm not going to read the entire thing. I am going to summarize.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>The things I'm going to summarize include that you were given what the writer refers to as psychometric findings. In other words, you were given objective tests that are recognized in the field to predict as best as anything can or to evaluate your dangerousness. And the writer found that: \"It is important to note that there was no evidence on Mr. Robinson's MCMI profile to suggest the presence of antisocial or sociopathic tendencies.\" MCMI stands for Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory III. That's the third part of it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>And they did another test or another set of inventory questions that show that you weren't deceiving or lying on the test. They are control questions. And it goes in great detail. And because of the detail of this report and because I'm including it in the record, I'm going to seal this transcript for obvious reasonswell, for the same reasons I sealed the presentence memorandum for the Defendant. And overall the conclusionand this is at page eight. \"On the STATIC-99, Mr. Robinson scored in the low risk category relevant to other adult male sex offenders. Offenders who score in this low range are generally considered appropriate for community supervision and treatment.\"</blockquote>\n<blockquote>And then, finally, in the writer's conclusions and recommendations at pages 9 and 10, it includes a conclusion that you're not a pedophile and gives the reasons ofgives his reasons of how he got to that conclusion. And, therefore, I am comfortable in varying to the degree that I'm varying.</blockquote>\n<p>(R. 25 at 23-25.) Finally, the court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote>But I think the important part of the report is the answer to the first question posed by the writer, which was is he a pedophile or not. And the conclusion was, not.</blockquote>\n<p>(R. 25 at 26.) The district court also stated that \"this court believes that the Defendant will not benefit from incarceration,\" \"[h]e has voluntarily sought counseling,\" and \"he does not render any recidivism factors for future behavior with children.\" (R. 25 at 23.) The court then contrasted possession of child pornography with some <span class=\"star-pagination\">*772</span> related offensessuch as its production and distributionthat the court regarded as more serious. The court also emphasized Robinson's employment history, attitude, age, and again reiterated his lack of significant criminal history.</p>\n<p>The district court then sentenced Robinson to one day of imprisonment, with credit for time already served, followed by a period of supervised release for five years, and a $100 special assessment. The terms of supervised release contained no significant special conditions. The government immediately objected to the court's downward variance. It then brought this appeal.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. DISCUSSION</h2>\n<p>On appeal, the government contends that Robinson's one-day sentence was unreasonable on two grounds. First, the government contends that the sentence imposed was procedurally unreasonable because the district court committed several factual errors at the sentencing hearing. Most importantly, the government contends the district court mischaracterized the conclusions of the psychological report. Second, the government contends that the sentence imposed was substantively unreasonable because the district court failed to consider several of the § 3553(a) factors relevant to this case. The parties also dispute whether our review should be for an abuse of discretion as to reasonableness or for plain error.</p>\n<p>The scope and extent of our review was explained in <i>United States v. Booker,</i> 543 U.S. 220, 260-262, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <i>Booker</i> invalidated that portion of the Sentencing Reform Act which, under 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b)(1), directed the courts of appeals to apply a <i>de novo</i> standard of review to sentences outside the Sentencing Guidelines. <i>Id.</i> Further, the Court held that the standard of review is one of reasonableness, as to whether the sentence imposed was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p>Following <i>Booker,</i> three subsequent Supreme Court opinions, decided on the same day, have given additional guidance as to the scope of review applicable to both guidelines and non-guidelines sentences. <i>Gall v. United States,</i> 552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <i>Kimbrough v. United States,</i> 552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007); <i>Rita v. United States,</i> 551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). In <i>Gall,</i> the Court held that a sentencing judge \"must explain his conclusion that an unusually lenient or an unusually harsh sentence is appropriate in a particular case with sufficient justifications.\" 552 U.S. at 46, 128 S.Ct. 586. The Court rejected, however, \"an appellate rule that requires `extraordinary' circumstances to justify a sentence outside the Guidelines range.\" <i>Id.</i> at 47, 128 S.Ct. 586. The Court reasoned that if a district court decides to impose a sentence outside the applicable guidelines range, the court must \"ensure that the justification is sufficiently compelling to support the degree of the variance. We find it uncontroversial that a major departure should be supported by a more significant justification than a minor one. After settling on the appropriate sentence, [a district court judge] must adequately explain the chosen sentence to allow for meaningful appellate review and to promote the perception of fair sentencing.\" <i>Id.</i> at 50, 128 S.Ct. 586.</p>\n<p>In defining the standard of appellate review post-<i>Booker,</i> the Supreme Court made clear that the courts of appeals retained an important role. In <i>Rita,</i> the Court emphasized \"[i]n sentencing, as in other areas, district judges at times make mistakes that are substantive. . . . Circuit courts exist to correct such mistakes when they occur.\" 551 U.S. at 354, 127 S.Ct. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*773</span> 2456. However, we must keep in mind that \"the clear, overriding import of [<i>Rita, Kimbrough,</i> and <i>Gall</i>] is that appellate courts must respect the role of district courts and stop substituting their judgment for that of those courts on the front line.\" <i>United States v. Phinazee,</i> 515 F.3d 511, 521 (6th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p>It is hardly controversial to say that appellate courts have struggled in applying the principles enunciated in <i>Rita, Gall,</i> and <i>Kimbrough.</i> Appellate courts have particularly struggled in review of possession of child pornography cases, where variances occur in 60% of cases according to the Sentencing Commission's 2010 Sourcebook of Federal Sentencing Statistics.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>Regardless of whether the sentence imposed is inside or outside of the guidelines range, an appellate court must use an abuse-of-discretion standard to assess whether a sentence is reasonable. <i>Gall,</i> 552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. As explained in <i>Rita,</i> a presumption of reasonableness applies to a sentence within the guidelines; no such presumption applies to a sentence reflecting a variance from the guidelines. 551 U.S. at 355-56, 127 S.Ct. 2456. Here, no presumption of reasonableness applies because the sentence imposed by the district court varied downward to an essentially non-custodial sentence.</p>\n<p>If a party fails to object to the sentence below, we review for plain error. <i>United States v. Vonner,</i> 516 F.3d 382, 385-86 (6th Cir.2008) (en banc). For plain error review to apply, a party must have had an opportunity to raise the objection below. <i>Id.</i> Here, the government objected to the sentence at the time it was imposed. (R. 25 at 30.) Accordingly, we review the district court's sentence under an abuse-of-discretion standard as to reasonableness, which has both a procedural and substantive component. <i>Gall,</i> 552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Procedural Reasonableness</h2>\n<p>Initially, we \"must first ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the § 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence.\" <i>Gall,</i> 552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. In particular, \"[t]he sentencing judge should set forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that he [or she] has considered the parties' arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising his own legal decisionmaking authority.\" <i>Rita,</i> 551 U.S. at 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456.</p>\n<p>The government contends that the district court fashioned its sentence based on three clearly erroneous facts: (1) most importantly, mischaracterizing the conclusions of Dr. Sugrue's psychological report and concluding that Robinson was not a pedophile; (2) mischaracterizing Robinson's criminal intent; and (3) wrongly claiming that the government had not previously prosecuted a collector of child pornography <span class=\"star-pagination\">*774</span> unless the person had a prior rape conviction. The government asserts that these factual errors, which drove the court's sentencing decision, rendered the sentence imposed procedurally unreasonable.</p>\n<p>The government first contends that the district court mischaracterized the psychological report. During the sentencing hearing, the district court reviewed the psychological report rendered by Dr. Sugrue and concluded that \"the important part of the report is the answer to the first question . . . is he a pedophile or not. And the conclusion was, not.\" (R. 25 at 26.) The government contends that the district court misconstrued the report because Dr. Sugrue never explicitly stated that Robinson was not a pedophile; rather, the report stated that \"[o]n the STATIC-99, Mr. Robinson scored in the low risk category relevant to other adult male sex offenders.\" (Report at 8.) While the government is correct that Dr. Sugrue's report did not explicitly state that Robinson was not a pedophile, the report is subject to varying interpretations. We cannot say that the district court's reliance on its interpretation of the psychological report rises to the level of being clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p>The government next contends that the district court mischaracterized Robinson's criminal intent by stating at the hearing, \"most people, yourself included, don't think that by purchasing something online that's available is necessarily a crime. Otherwise, nobody would use their credit cards to do it and nobody would use their home computer to do it.\" (R. 25 at 15.) We find this argument unavailing. Robinson did not need to know that possession of child pornography was a crime; he only needed to know that that he was in possession of child pornography. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. § 2252A(a)(5)(B).</p>\n<p>Also unavailing is the government's third contention that the district court attempted to diminish the significance of Robinson's criminal conduct by wrongly claiming that the government had previously only prosecuted possessors of child pornography who had a prior conviction for rape. Specifically, the district court stated, \"when [the government] first started bringing these cases, the one thing they had in common with each other, but not with this case, is the person, if they were in their forties, had a prior sexual conviction in state court generally, either statutory rape or straight out rape, what's called CSC 1.\" (R. 25 at 17.) When put into context, however, the court made this comment when speaking to the dangerousness to the community of these types of offenders. The court was merely remarking that it personally noticed that the first wave of prosecutions for possession of child pornography seemed to involve offenders with prior rape convictions.</p>\n<p>Despite the remarks made by the district court and its interpretation of the psychological report, the factual findings on which it based its sentence were not clearly erroneous. In short, we find the sentence imposed to be procedurally reasonable.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Substantive Reasonableness</h2>\n<p>We next consider whether Robinson's sentence was substantively reasonable in light of the sentencing factors recited in § 3553(a). \"A sentence may be considered substantively unreasonable when the district court selects a sentence arbitrarily, bases the sentence on impermissible factors, fails to consider relevant sentencing factors, or gives an unreasonable amount of weight to any pertinent factor.\" <i>United States v. Conatser,</i> 514 F.3d 508, 520 (6th Cir.2008). The government contends that the district court failed to consider several § 3553(a) factors relevant to the crimeincluding the need for <span class=\"star-pagination\">*775</span> the sentence to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishmentand instead placed unreasonable weight on factors related to Robinson's likelihood of recidivism and whether he was a pedophile. The government also contends that the district court did not adequately consider the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants convicted of similar conduct.</p>\n<p>The district court granted a 78-month downward variance from the low end of the guidelines range. While we do not use any form of strict proportionality review, <i>United States v. Bolds,</i> 511 F.3d 568, 580-81 (6th Cir.2007), the greater the district court's variance, the more compelling the evidence must be. <i>See </i><i>Gall,</i> 552 U.S. at 50, 128 S.Ct. 586 (\"We find it uncontroversial that a major departure should be supported by a more significant justification than a minor one.\"); <i>United States v. Grossman,</i> 513 F.3d 592, 596 (6th Cir.2008) (holding that it is not improper to \"require some correlation between the extent of a variance and the justification for it\").</p>\n<p>In justifying its downward variance, the district court granted leniency based primarily on the characteristics of the offender. The district court placed substantial weight on Robinson's psychological evaluation, interpreting Dr. Sugrue's report to conclude that Robinson was not dangerous and not a pedophile. Relying heavily on that conclusion, the district court judge made the following statements: \"[h]e does not render any recidivism factors for future behavior with children,\" \"I'm convinced you're not going to do that again,\" \"[a]nd, therefore, I am comfortable in varying to the degree that I'm varying.\" (R. 25 at 23, 25, 31.)</p>\n<p>While the district court thoroughly considered the \"history and characteristics of the defendant[,]\" <i>see</i> § 3553(a)(1), and \"the need for the sentence imposed . . . to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant[,]\" <i>see</i> § 3553(a)(2)(C), the sentence imposed must do more. The sentence was based, in large part, on a prediction of future conduct concerning a particular type of crime that was not at issue in this case. The crime of conviction in this case was possession of child pornography, not sexual abuse of a child.</p>\n<p>The district court also emphasized Robinson's employment history, age, and debilitating back condition. Although the guidelines discourage consideration of these factors, <i>Booker</i> renders the guidelines advisory. <i>See</i> U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual §§ 5H1.1, 5H1.4, 5H1.5 (2011). Thus, while a district court may consider such factors in deciding whether a variance is warranted and in determining the extent of any variance, it should take into account \"the `discouraged' status of these factors.\" <i>United States v. Borho,</i> 485 F.3d 904, 913 (6th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>The district court also may not disregard the other § 3553(a) factors. The § 3553(a) factors also require the district court to consider \"the need for the sentence imposedto reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense[,]\" <i>see</i> § 3553(a)(2)(A), \"to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct[,]\" <i>see</i> § 3553(a)(2)(B), and \"to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct[,]\" <i>see</i> § 3553(a)(6). The lack of weight given to these other factors renders the sentence in this case substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Seriousness of the Offense</h2>\n<p>Prominent among the § 3553(a) factors is the \"need for the sentence imposed . . . to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide <span class=\"star-pagination\">*776</span> just punishment for the offense.\" In this case, the offense is knowing possession of child pornography in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2252A(a)(5)(B).</p>\n<p>The sentence does not reflect the seriousness of this offense. Child pornography is, without qualification, a serious crime. Robinson's specific conduct in possessing over 7100 images of child pornography was unquestionably serious. Some of the images involved the bondage, torture, and rape of prepubescent children. Further, Robinson did not just possess imageshe subscribed to a child pornography website and paid a fee for images.<sup>[2]</sup> The guidelines range reflected all of these considerations by adding thirteen points to Robinson's guidelines score. The district court did not address the enhancements which were applied in computing the guidelines range. Nor did it explain why Robinson's lack of a significant criminal record justified a major variance from the sentence recommended by the guidelines.</p>\n<p>The district court also stated that \"everyone would agree that especially if you're an organizer and a creator of this kind of material, a very severe sentence is warranted,\" and \"the most time [i.e., severe sentences] should go to the creators; the next most time to the distributors and/or possessors who may be prone to commit sexual offenses against children.\" (R. 25 at 18, 22.) We do not disagree with these statements. However, \"[t]hat the producers of child pornography are more culpable . . . does not mean that its knowing and deliberate possessors are barely culpable at all.\" <i>United States v. Bistline,</i> 665 F.3d 758, 765 (6th Cir.2012). Robinson knowingly acquired the images affirmatively, deliberately, and repeatedly, hundreds of times over the course of five years.</p>\n<p>The district court's sentence, however, did not adequately reflect that fact. Nor did the sentence itself reflect the seriousness of his crime, promote respect for the law, or provide just punishment for his offense.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Deterrence</h2>\n<p>Another § 3553(a) factor is \"the need for the sentence imposed . . . to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct[.]\" 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2)(B). The district court thought that factor was satisfied here because \"this is a sex offense . . . [making it] necessary for [Robinson] to register as a sex offender, which, by the way, is another element of deterrence both for you and for everybody else. Nobody wants to be on a list like that.\" (R. 25 at 29.) The district court also noted that \"[t]o the limited extent that anyone knows about [Robinson's] arrest, that's deterrence\"; and \"the fact that [Robinson was] caught and that gets out into the community, that will deter some other people\"; and \"sometimes the Government issues a press release . . . [a]nd three or 400 more people may read it or a thousand people, and some of those people might not do that conduct because they know . . . it's a felony conviction\"; and \"nothing I say here <span class=\"star-pagination\">*777</span> today will take out the fact that for the rest of your lifeyou're 43 years oldyou have a felony conviction: And that will deter people. And it will especially deter you.\" (R. 25 at 15.)</p>\n<p>However, these consequences do not arise from Robinson's sentence. Rather, they arise from his prosecution and conviction. Section 3553(a)(2)(B) plainly states that \"the <i>sentence</i> imposed\" should \"afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct\" (emphasis added). This is not reflected in Robinson's sentence. We have previously held that, under § 3553(a)(2)(B) and (C), deterring future criminal behavior and protecting the public as sentencing factors in a child pornography case should be focused upon the market for such activities. The emphasis should be upon deterring the production, distribution, receipt, or possession of child pornography, and not a prediction of future sexual contact with children. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Christman,</i> 607 F.3d 1110, 1122-23 (6th Cir.2010). General deterrence is crucial in the child pornography context, as the Seventh Circuit has explained:</p>\n<blockquote>Young children were raped in order to enable the production of the pornography that the defendant both downloaded and uploaded. . . . The greater the customer demand for child pornography, the more that will be produced. Sentences influence behavior, or so at least Congress thought when in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) it made deterrence a statutory sentencing factor. The logic of deterrence suggests that the lighter the punishment for downloading and uploading child pornography, the greater the customer demand for it and so the more will be produced.</blockquote>\n<p><i>United States v. Goldberg,</i> 491 F.3d 668, 672 (7th Cir.2007) (citations omitted); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Goff,</i> 501 F.3d 250, 261 (3d Cir.2007) (\"[D]eterring the production of child pornography and protecting the children who are victimized by it are factors that should have been given significant weight at sentencing, but in fact received not a word from the District Court.\").</p>\n<p>Robinson's sentence, which was devoid of any significant period of incarceration, home confinement, or substantial fine, undermines the purpose of general deterrence. As deterrence has both an individualized and more general component, particularly in the child pornography context, we do not see how Robinson's sentence would meaningfully deter anyone else.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. Sentence Disparities</h2>\n<p>Another factor is \"the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct[.]\" 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(6). The sentencing guidelines already take into consideration Robinson's lack of significant criminal history and specific conduct in violating 18 U.S.C. § 2252A(a)(5)(B). Yet his guidelines range was 78 to 97 months' imprisonment. As we articulated in <i>Bistline,</i> \"[w]e do not mean to imply that only a sentence in or around that range will avoid disparities with other similar defendants. But we do not see how the sentence imposed here avoids them.\" 665 F.3d at 767.</p>\n<p>At the sentencing hearing, the district court discussed several cases in which the Sixth Circuit affirmed sentences in child pornography cases that significantly varied from the guidelines. (R. 25 at 18-23.) The court noted that the cases involved \"distinguishing characteristics as to each individual\" and the decisions were \"distinguishable because the individual[s] involved [were] much more active in either creating or distributing the material.\" (R. 25 at 16, 21.) However, as we have stated before:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*778</span> [It] is not logical to justify a more lenient sentence on the basis that [the defendant] did not make or distribute child pornography or molest a child. Just as the federal sentencing laws impose greater sentences upon sellers of controlled substances than upon those who are caught possessing such substances. . . the federal child sexual offense laws do so as well. Indeed, the Sentencing Guidelines take into account only the criminal conduct of which [the defendant] was charged.</blockquote>\n<p><i>United States v. Camiscione,</i> 591 F.3d 823, 834 (6th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p>We note that the sentencing guidelines relating to child pornography have generated much controversy and are currently under review by the Sentencing Commission. This case is grimly typical in a number of aspects which enhanced the offense level under the guidelines. Robinson was assessed two extra levels for use of a computer, which now occurs in almost every case. Enhancements to the base offense level are meant to increase a sentence for conduct more aggravated than the typical type of offense, making this guideline an anomaly. In Robinson's case, he was assessed six additional levels because the visual conduct included depictions of prepubescent children being subjected to rape and sadomasochistic or violent conduct. These enhancements have received far less criticism than that of using a computer.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the most criticized enhancement involves the number of child pornography images possessed by a defendant. In this case, Robinson was assessed five levels because the offense involved more than 600 images. In a number of offense guidelines, amounts involved in criminal conduct are used to adjust the guidelines range by adding points to the base offense level; <i>e.g.,</i> drug quantities in § 2D1.1, amount of loss in § 2B1.1; number of firearms in § 2K2.1. <i>See</i> U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual §§ 2D1.1, 2B1.1, 2K2.1 (2011). In many cases, the extent and degree of criminal conduct bears a relationship to such quantifiable measurements.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>In the computer age, we have some doubt that the number of pictures alone captures the gravity of the crime of possession of child pornography. A defendant who knowingly shares files containing child pornography does not necessarily know the number to be received. A saver of files, who has viewed and traded as many images as a non-saver of files, is subjected to a far greater sentencing guidelines range.</p>\n<p>These issues bear upon the facts in this case. While this Court is not tasked with crafting sentencing guidelines or randomly critiquing the work of the Sentencing Commission, it is noteworthy that Robinson acquired a large number of images of child pornography over a five-year period. This fact seems much more appropriate to a sentencing enhancement under the guidelines than a large number of images, all of which could have been downloaded on a single day. Robinson paid money for some of the images and engaged in the criminal conduct over a long period of time, all of which are factors to be considered at sentencing. In sum, while aspects of the sentencing guidelines for child pornography have generated substantial controversy, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*779</span> two enhancements particular to this case make the conduct of the defendant more aggravating.</p>\n<p>We pause to explain why our decision in this case is not controlled by our decisions in <i>United States v. Stall,</i> 581 F.3d 276 (6th Cir.2009) and <i>United States v. Prisel,</i> 316 Fed.Appx. 377 (6th Cir.2008), where we considered whether one-day sentences of imprisonment for possession of child pornography were substantively reasonable. In both cases, we affirmed the sentences under the more stringent plain-error standard of review. The sentences imposed in those cases, however, were more severe than Robinson's sentence. The sentences in <i>Stall</i> and <i>Prisel</i> imposed very restrictive conditions as part of the defendants' supervised release, as well as significant fines. <i>See </i><i>Stall,</i> 581 F.3d at 281 (affirming, under plain-error review, sentence of one day of imprisonment, ten years of supervised release, the first year of which was under home confinement, and $5,000 fine for possession of eighteen images of child pornography, where applicable guidelines range was 57 to 71 months); <i>Prisel,</i> 316 Fed.Appx. at 380 (affirming, under plain-error review, sentence of one day of imprisonment, three years of supervised release, the first eighteen months of which were under home confinement with electronic monitoring, and a $6,000 fine for possession of 1,189 images and five digital movies containing child pornography, where applicable guidelines range was 27 to 33 months). Unlike the facts in <i>Stall,</i> here, the district court did not conduct an \"extensive analysis of how a [five-year] term of supervised release would restrict [the defendant's] freedom and protect the public\" or explain \"why the district court believed this sentence will deter similar offenders and why this case warranted a variance.\" 581 F.3d at 287.</p>\n<p>Although the courts in <i>Stall</i> and <i>Prisel</i> rejected the applicable guidelines ranges, they nevertheless sentenced the defendants to lengthy periods of supervised releaseperiods of which required home confinementand substantial fines. Robinson's sentence of one day of imprisonment followed by a five-year term of supervised release under a recommended guidelines range of 78 to 97 months' imprisonment for possessing 7100 images of child pornography does not begin to approach the severity of the sentences imposed in <i>Stall</i> or <i>Prisel.</i></p>\n<p>Ultimately, the factors that the district court relied on, as articulated in the record, do not justify a variance of this size. Accordingly, we find the variance here to be substantively unreasonable based on the current record. \"[W]e recognize that our substantive review of sentences is deferential. . . [e]ven so, the sentence in this case can withstand review only if deference amounts to abdication[.]\" <i>United States v. Irey,</i> 612 F.3d 1160, 1165 (11th Cir.2010) (en banc).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>We express no view as to an appropriate sentence upon remand to the district court. Fashioning an appropriate sentence is a most difficult task, particularly in a child pornography case. We recognize that in some cases there can be very different circumstances for which <i>Booker</i> now compels the district court judge to decide what the appropriate sentence may be. The crime of possessing child pornography is difficult to understand; some cases involve defendants with their own history of sexual abuse as a child, <i>see </i><i>United States v. Fink,</i> 502 F.3d 585, 587-88 (6th Cir.2007); others involve defendants with serious mental illness, <i>see </i><i>United States v. Brooks,</i> 628 F.3d 791, 794-98 (6th Cir.2011). To paraphrase <i>Gall,</i> extraordinary circumstances may justify extraordinary variances or departures. 552 U.S. at 50, 128 S.Ct. 586. No <span class=\"star-pagination\">*780</span> such circumstances were identified by the district court as it imposed the sentence. We leave it to the district court to review all of the relevant facts and § 3553(a) factors to re-craft an appropriate sentence.</p>\n<p>For the reasons discussed above, we VACATE Robinson's sentence and REMAND for resentencing in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  The Honorable Edmund A.

In fiscal year 2010, the non-government sponsored below-guideline rate was 44.6%, the government sponsored below-guideline rate was 13.5%, and the above-guideline rate was 2.0%. <i>Id.</i> By comparison, for all offenders, the non-government sponsored below-guideline rate was 17.8%, the government sponsored below-guideline rate was 25.4%, and the above-guideline rate was 1.8%. 2010 Sourcebook, Table N: National Comparison of Sentence Imposed and Position Relative to the Guideline Range.</p>\n<p>[2]  The fact that Robinson paid money to a website could have justified a charge of receiving child pornography under 18 U.S.C. § 2252A(a)(2). This section defines distribution or receipt of child pornography as the same crime and imposes a mandatory five-year minimum sentence. In many cases, the distinction between possessing child pornography (which carries no mandatory minimum) and receiving child pornography (which carries the five-year mandatory minimum) is nonexistent. But paying a service for providing child pornography is qualitatively different than file sharing. We note that standing alone, the current statutory scheme makes no principled distinction between possessing and receiving child pornography, which can often times be virtually identical conduct, but nonetheless results in vastly different mandatory sentencing ranges.</p>\n<p>[3]  In many cases, the opposite may be true. In the case of a low level drug carrier who cannot access the trunk where the drugs are located, the quantity of drugs is not indicative of the gravity of the defendant's conduct. In many fraud cases, the amount of fraud depends upon fortuity, length of operation, or amount available. In other words, more would have been taken in some cases; in others, much smaller in scope, good or bad fortune drove the amount.</p>\n\n</div>",

Mulcahy, Assistant United States Attorney, Detroit, Michigan, for Appellant. Kimberly W. Stout, Birmingham, Michigan, for Appellee.</p>\n<p>Before: COLE and ROGERS, Circuit Judges; SARGUS, District Judge.<sup>[*]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>OPINION</h2>\n<p>SARGUS, District Judge.</p>\n<p>Rufus Robinson pled guilty to knowingly possessing over 7100 images of child pornography on his computer. Some of the images involved the bondage, torture, and rape of prepubescent children. Under the Sentencing Guidelines, Robinson's recommended sentence was 78 to 97 months' imprisonment. The district court rejected that recommendation and imposed a sentence of one day in custody, a term of supervised release of five years, and a $100 special assessment. The United States contends that Robinson's sentence is both procedurally and substantively unreasonable. We agree that the sentence is substantively unreasonable, and vacate his sentence.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>In April 2006, Robinson subscribed to an online website which allowed him, for a fee, to access large amounts of child pornography. Robinson used a credit card and paid a fee to subscribe to the site. As part of a national investigation, agents from the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\") later identified the website as a pay-for-subscription child pornography website. ICE agents gathered the credit card information for the subscribers of the site, including Robinson.</p>\n<p>In October 2007, ICE agents came to Robinson's home and informed him that he was suspected of possessing child pornography. Robinson permitted the agents to conduct a forensic preview as well as a full examination of both computers located in his residence. He told the agents that he lived alone and was the only person with access to the computers. Between the two computers and a collection of CDs and DVDs, agents found over 7100 images of child pornography. Some of the images involved the bondage, torture, and rape of prepubescent children.</p>\n<p>Robinson later pled guilty without a plea agreement to one count of possession of child pornography in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2252A(a)(5)(B). In calculating the applicable Sentencing Guidelines range, the parties agreed that the U.S. Probation Office had correctly determined, under U.S.S.G. § 2G2.2(a)(1), that Robinson's base offense level was 18. Two levels were added because the material depicted prepubescent juveniles; four levels were added because the material portrayed sadomasochistic or violent content; two levels were added for the use of a computer; and five levels were added because the offense involved more than 600 images. This netted to an offense level of 31, which was reduced by three levels for Robinson's acceptance of responsibility. Robinson <span class=\"star-pagination\">*770</span> had no significant criminal record and scored no criminal history points, which placed him in Criminal History Category I. Robinson's adjusted offense level was 28, which, with a criminal history category of I, resulted in a guidelines range of 78 to 97 months. The Presentence Report (\"PSR\") recommended a sentence within the guidelines range. Neither Robinson nor the government objected to the PSR.</p>\n<p>Prior to sentencing, Robinson was examined by Dr. Dennis P. Sugrue, a psychologist. In a narrative report (\"Report\"), Dr. Sugrue described in detail Robinson's psychological condition, reported the results of three psychometric tests, and rendered a series of conclusions and opinions. The first psychometric finding reported the results of a Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory-III (\"MCMI III\"). The MCMI III is \"designed to identify both acute and characterological psychiatric conditions.\" (Report at 6.) Dr. Sugrue concluded from the MCMI III that Robinson did not suffer from \"antisocial or sociopathic tendencies.\" (<i>Id.</i>)</p>\n<p>The second test, Multiphasic Sex Inventory IIAdult Male Form (\"MSI II\"), is designed to measure the sexual characteristics of an adult male sex offender. From an examination of Robinson's responses, Dr. Sugrue found that Robinson was not addicted to pornography, and either did not or could not \"acknowledge ever having had sexual fantasies or desire involving children that would lead him to seek child pornography. He nevertheless acknowledges having sought and obtained pornography involving children.\" (Report at 7.)</p>\n<p>The third test, STATIC-99, is designed to assist in the prediction of sexual and violent recidivism for sexual offenders. The test produces estimates of future risk based upon the number of risk factors present in any one individual, primarily measuring prior sex offenses or crimes of violence. As Dr. Sugrue notes, \"the STATIC-99 and most other risk assessment scales have not been normed for individuals possessing child pornography.\" (Report at 8.) Dr. Sugrue found that \"Robinson scored in the lowest risk category relative to other adult male sex offenders.\" (<i>Id.</i>)</p>\n<p>Incorporating the results of the three tests into a conclusive summary, Dr. Sugrue noted that Robinson did not appear to be a pedophile. The conclusions offered by Dr. Sugrue, however, related solely to the question of whether Robinson is a pedophile and whether he is likely to sexually abuse a child, a crime for which he was not charged. Dr. Sugrue concluded that, to date, the only scientifically valid method of determining the risk of new offenses involving child sex offenses is based upon the presence of prior, similar offenses. Based on Robinson's testing failure to show evidence of an antisocial personality, his lack of criminal history, and scoring in the lowest risk category, Dr. Sugrue stated that \"[o]ffenders who score in the low range of risk assessment inventories are generally considered appropriate for community supervision and treatment.\" (Report at 10.) In addition, Dr. Sugrue did not conclude that Robinson suffered from any significant mental health disorder.</p>\n<p>At sentencing, Robinson's counsel urged the district court to vary from the guidelines range and consider a lengthy probationary term. Robinson's counsel asked the district court to consider that, per the report of Dr. Sugrue, Robinson was neither dangerous nor a predator. Further, Robinson's counsel requested the court take into account Robinson's initial cooperation with investigating agents, his lack of criminal history, his attendance at counseling, and his painful, debilitating back condition. The government requested a sentence within the guidelines range, emphasizing <span class=\"star-pagination\">*771</span> that Robinson and others created a market for child pornography. In its sentencing memorandum, the government asserted that the willingness of Robinson to pay a subscription to a child pornography website provided direct financial incentive to producers of such materials and could have led to the abuse of actual children.</p>\n<p>The district court began by correctly calculating the sentencing guidelines range. It then reviewed in considerable detail the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a). The court noted that Robinson had no criminal history points, was in need of continued counseling, and would be categorized as a felon for the rest of his life. The district court then stated:</p>\n<blockquote>And obviously dangerousness is a factor. And for the reasons that I have concluded that you're going to be deterred by the fact that you have a felony conviction and have gone through this experience, it also leads me to the conclusion you're not going to be dangerous to anybody. And that's supported by what I consider to be a very comprehensive report attached to the Sentencing Memorandum, the psychological report.</blockquote>\n<p>(R. 25 at 16.) The district court further noted:</p>\n<blockquote>And now I'm going to refer to what has been marked as Exhibit B, which is a psychological evaluation of Rufus R. Robinsonthat is youthat's dated September 26th of 2008. And I'm not going to read the entire thing. I am going to summarize.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>The things I'm going to summarize include that you were given what the writer refers to as psychometric findings. In other words, you were given objective tests that are recognized in the field to predict as best as anything can or to evaluate your dangerousness. And the writer found that: \"It is important to note that there was no evidence on Mr. Robinson's MCMI profile to suggest the presence of antisocial or sociopathic tendencies.\" MCMI stands for Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory III. That's the third part of it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>And they did another test or another set of inventory questions that show that you weren't deceiving or lying on the test. They are control questions. And it goes in great detail. And because of the detail of this report and because I'm including it in the record, I'm going to seal this transcript for obvious reasonswell, for the same reasons I sealed the presentence memorandum for the Defendant. And overall the conclusionand this is at page eight. \"On the STATIC-99, Mr. Robinson scored in the low risk category relevant to other adult male sex offenders. Offenders who score in this low range are generally considered appropriate for community supervision and treatment.\"</blockquote>\n<blockquote>And then, finally, in the writer's conclusions and recommendations at pages 9 and 10, it includes a conclusion that you're not a pedophile and gives the reasons ofgives his reasons of how he got to that conclusion. And, therefore, I am comfortable in varying to the degree that I'm varying.</blockquote>\n<p>(R. 25 at 23-25.) Finally, the court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote>But I think the important part of the report is the answer to the first question posed by the writer, which was is he a pedophile or not. And the conclusion was, not.</blockquote>\n<p>(R. 25 at 26.) The district court also stated that \"this court believes that the Defendant will not benefit from incarceration,\" \"[h]e has voluntarily sought counseling,\" and \"he does not render any recidivism factors for future behavior with children.\" (R. 25 at 23.) The court then contrasted possession of child pornography with some <span class=\"star-pagination\">*772</span> related offensessuch as its production and distributionthat the court regarded as more serious. The court also emphasized Robinson's employment history, attitude, age, and again reiterated his lack of significant criminal history.</p>\n<p>The district court then sentenced Robinson to one day of imprisonment, with credit for time already served, followed by a period of supervised release for five years, and a $100 special assessment. The terms of supervised release contained no significant special conditions. The government immediately objected to the court's downward variance. It then brought this appeal.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. DISCUSSION</h2>\n<p>On appeal, the government contends that Robinson's one-day sentence was unreasonable on two grounds. First, the government contends that the sentence imposed was procedurally unreasonable because the district court committed several factual errors at the sentencing hearing. Most importantly, the government contends the district court mischaracterized the conclusions of the psychological report. Second, the government contends that the sentence imposed was substantively unreasonable because the district court failed to consider several of the § 3553(a) factors relevant to this case. The parties also dispute whether our review should be for an abuse of discretion as to reasonableness or for plain error.</p>\n<p>The scope and extent of our review was explained in <i>United States v. Booker,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></span>, 260-262, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">621</span></span> (2005). <i>Booker</i> invalidated that portion of the Sentencing Reform Act which, under 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b)(1), directed the courts of appeals to apply a <i>de novo</i> standard of review to sentences outside the Sentencing Guidelines. <i>Id.</i> Further, the Court held that the standard of review is one of reasonableness, as to whether the sentence imposed was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p>Following <i>Booker,</i> three subsequent Supreme Court opinions, decided on the same day, have given additional guidance as to the scope of review applicable to both guidelines and non-guidelines sentences. <i>Gall v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">203</span></a></span> (2007). In <i>Gall,</i> the Court held that a sentencing judge \"must explain his conclusion that an unusually lenient or an unusually harsh sentence is appropriate in a particular case with sufficient justifications.\" 552 U.S. at 46, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145843\"><a href=\"/opinion/145843/gall-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">586</span></a></span>. The Court rejected, however, \"an appellate rule that requires `extraordinary' circumstances to justify a sentence outside the Guidelines range.\" <i>Id.</i> at 47, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145843\"><a href=\"/opinion/145843/gall-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">586</span></a></span>. The Court reasoned that if a district court decides to impose a sentence outside the applicable guidelines range, the court must \"ensure that the justification is sufficiently compelling to support the degree of the variance. We find it uncontroversial that a major departure should be supported by a more significant justification than a minor one. After settling on the appropriate sentence, [a district court judge] must adequately explain the chosen sentence to allow for meaningful appellate review and to promote the perception of fair sentencing.\" <i>Id.</i> at 50, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145843\"><a href=\"/opinion/145843/gall-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">586</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>In defining the standard of appellate review post-<i>Booker,</i> the Supreme Court made clear that the courts of appeals retained an important role. In <i>Rita,</i> the Court emphasized \"[i]n sentencing, as in other areas, district judges at times make mistakes that are substantive. . . . Circuit courts exist to correct such mistakes when they occur.\" 551 U.S. at 354, 127 S.Ct. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*773</span> 2456. However, we must keep in mind that \"the clear, overriding import of [<i>Rita, Kimbrough,</i> and <i>Gall</i>] is that appellate courts must respect the role of district courts and stop substituting their judgment for that of those courts on the front line.\" <i>United States v. Phinazee,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1386759\"><a href=\"/opinion/1386759/united-states-v-phinazee/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">511</span></a></span>, 521 (6th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p>It is hardly controversial to say that appellate courts have struggled in applying the principles enunciated in <i>Rita, Gall,</i> and <i>Kimbrough.</i> Appellate courts have particularly struggled in review of possession of child pornography cases, where variances occur in 60% of cases according to the Sentencing Commission's 2010 Sourcebook of Federal Sentencing Statistics.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>Regardless of whether the sentence imposed is inside or outside of the guidelines range, an appellate court must use an abuse-of-discretion standard to assess whether a sentence is reasonable. <i>Gall,</i> 552 U.S. at 51, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145843\"><a href=\"/opinion/145843/gall-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">586</span></a></span>. As explained in <i>Rita,</i> a presumption of reasonableness applies to a sentence within the guidelines; no such presumption applies to a sentence reflecting a variance from the guidelines. 551 U.S. at 355-56, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145708\"><a href=\"/opinion/145708/rita-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2456</span></a></span>. Here, no presumption of reasonableness applies because the sentence imposed by the district court varied downward to an essentially non-custodial sentence.</p>\n<p>If a party fails to object to the sentence below, we review for plain error. <i>United States v. Vonner,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1262428\"><a href=\"/opinion/1262428/united-states-v-vonner/\"><span class=\"volume\">516</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">382</span></a></span>, 385-86 (6th Cir.2008) (en banc). For plain error review to apply, a party must have had an opportunity to raise the objection below. <i>Id.</i> Here, the government objected to the sentence at the time it was imposed. (R. 25 at 30.) Accordingly, we review the district court's sentence under an abuse-of-discretion standard as to reasonableness, which has both a procedural and substantive component. <i>Gall,</i> 552 U.S. at 51, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145843\"><a href=\"/opinion/145843/gall-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">586</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Procedural Reasonableness</h2>\n<p>Initially, we \"must first ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the § 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence.\" <i>Gall,</i> 552 U.S. at 51, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145843\"><a href=\"/opinion/145843/gall-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">586</span></a></span>. In particular, \"[t]he sentencing judge should set forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that he [or she] has considered the parties' arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising his own legal decisionmaking authority.\" <i>Rita,</i> 551 U.S. at 356, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145708\"><a href=\"/opinion/145708/rita-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2456</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>The government contends that the district court fashioned its sentence based on three clearly erroneous facts: (1) most importantly, mischaracterizing the conclusions of Dr. Sugrue's psychological report and concluding that Robinson was not a pedophile; (2) mischaracterizing Robinson's criminal intent; and (3) wrongly claiming that the government had not previously prosecuted a collector of child pornography <span class=\"star-pagination\">*774</span> unless the person had a prior rape conviction. The government asserts that these factual errors, which drove the court's sentencing decision, rendered the sentence imposed procedurally unreasonable.</p>\n<p>The government first contends that the district court mischaracterized the psychological report. During the sentencing hearing, the district court reviewed the psychological report rendered by Dr. Sugrue and concluded that \"the important part of the report is the answer to the first question . . . is he a pedophile or not. And the conclusion was, not.\" (R. 25 at 26.) The government contends that the district court misconstrued the report because Dr. Sugrue never explicitly stated that Robinson was not a pedophile; rather, the report stated that \"[o]n the STATIC-99, Mr. Robinson scored in the low risk category relevant to other adult male sex offenders.\" (Report at 8.) While the government is correct that Dr. Sugrue's report did not explicitly state that Robinson was not a pedophile, the report is subject to varying interpretations. We cannot say that the district court's reliance on its interpretation of the psychological report rises to the level of being clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p>The government next contends that the district court mischaracterized Robinson's criminal intent by stating at the hearing, \"most people, yourself included, don't think that by purchasing something online that's available is necessarily a crime. Otherwise, nobody would use their credit cards to do it and nobody would use their home computer to do it.\" (R. 25 at 15.) We find this argument unavailing. Robinson did not need to know that possession of child pornography was a crime; he only needed to know that that he was in possession of child pornography. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. § 2252A(a)(5)(B).</p>\n<p>Also unavailing is the government's third contention that the district court attempted to diminish the significance of Robinson's criminal conduct by wrongly claiming that the government had previously only prosecuted possessors of child pornography who had a prior conviction for rape. Specifically, the district court stated, \"when [the government] first started bringing these cases, the one thing they had in common with each other, but not with this case, is the person, if they were in their forties, had a prior sexual conviction in state court generally, either statutory rape or straight out rape, what's called CSC 1.\" (R. 25 at 17.) When put into context, however, the court made this comment when speaking to the dangerousness to the community of these types of offenders. The court was merely remarking that it personally noticed that the first wave of prosecutions for possession of child pornography seemed to involve offenders with prior rape convictions.</p>\n<p>Despite the remarks made by the district court and its interpretation of the psychological report, the factual findings on which it based its sentence were not clearly erroneous. In short, we find the sentence imposed to be procedurally reasonable.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Substantive Reasonableness</h2>\n<p>We next consider whether Robinson's sentence was substantively reasonable in light of the sentencing factors recited in § 3553(a). \"A sentence may be considered substantively unreasonable when the district court selects a sentence arbitrarily, bases the sentence on impermissible factors, fails to consider relevant sentencing factors, or gives an unreasonable amount of weight to any pertinent factor.\" <i>United States v. Conatser,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1385884\"><a href=\"/opinion/1385884/united-states-v-conatser/\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">508</span></a></span>, 520 (6th Cir.2008). The government contends that the district court failed to consider several § 3553(a) factors relevant to the crimeincluding the need for <span class=\"star-pagination\">*775</span> the sentence to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishmentand instead placed unreasonable weight on factors related to Robinson's likelihood of recidivism and whether he was a pedophile. The government also contends that the district court did not adequately consider the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants convicted of similar conduct.</p>\n<p>The district court granted a 78-month downward variance from the low end of the guidelines range. While we do not use any form of strict proportionality review, <i>United States v. Bolds,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1194668\"><a href=\"/opinion/1194668/united-states-v-bolds/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">568</span></a></span>, 580-81 (6th Cir.2007), the greater the district court's variance, the more compelling the evidence must be. <i>See </i><i>Gall,</i> 552 U.S. at 50, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145843\"><a href=\"/opinion/145843/gall-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">586</span></a></span> (\"We find it uncontroversial that a major departure should be supported by a more significant justification than a minor one.\"); <i>United States v. Grossman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1272746\"><a href=\"/opinion/1272746/united-states-v-grossman/\"><span class=\"volume\">513</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">592</span></a></span>, 596 (6th Cir.2008) (holding that it is not improper to \"require some correlation between the extent of a variance and the justification for it\").</p>\n<p>In justifying its downward variance, the district court granted leniency based primarily on the characteristics of the offender. The district court placed substantial weight on Robinson's psychological evaluation, interpreting Dr. Sugrue's report to conclude that Robinson was not dangerous and not a pedophile. Relying heavily on that conclusion, the district court judge made the following statements: \"[h]e does not render any recidivism factors for future behavior with children,\" \"I'm convinced you're not going to do that again,\" \"[a]nd, therefore, I am comfortable in varying to the degree that I'm varying.\" (R. 25 at 23, 25, 31.)</p>\n<p>While the district court thoroughly considered the \"history and characteristics of the defendant[,]\" <i>see</i> § 3553(a)(1), and \"the need for the sentence imposed . . . to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant[,]\" <i>see</i> § 3553(a)(2)(C), the sentence imposed must do more. The sentence was based, in large part, on a prediction of future conduct concerning a particular type of crime that was not at issue in this case. The crime of conviction in this case was possession of child pornography, not sexual abuse of a child.</p>\n<p>The district court also emphasized Robinson's employment history, age, and debilitating back condition. Although the guidelines discourage consideration of these factors, <i>Booker</i> renders the guidelines advisory. <i>See</i> U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual §§ 5H1.1, 5H1.4, 5H1.5 (2011). Thus, while a district court may consider such factors in deciding whether a variance is warranted and in determining the extent of any variance, it should take into account \"the `discouraged' status of these factors.\" <i>United States v. Borho,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"797682\"><a href=\"/opinion/797682/united-states-v-norman-borho/\"><span class=\"volume\">485</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">904</span></a></span>, 913 (6th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>The district court also may not disregard the other § 3553(a) factors. The § 3553(a) factors also require the district court to consider \"the need for the sentence imposedto reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense[,]\" <i>see</i> § 3553(a)(2)(A), \"to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct[,]\" <i>see</i> § 3553(a)(2)(B), and \"to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct[,]\" <i>see</i> § 3553(a)(6). The lack of weight given to these other factors renders the sentence in this case substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Seriousness of the Offense</h2>\n<p>Prominent among the § 3553(a) factors is the \"need for the sentence imposed . . . to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide <span class=\"star-pagination\">*776</span> just punishment for the offense.\" In this case, the offense is knowing possession of child pornography in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2252A(a)(5)(B).</p>\n<p>The sentence does not reflect the seriousness of this offense. Child pornography is, without qualification, a serious crime. Robinson's specific conduct in possessing over 7100 images of child pornography was unquestionably serious. Some of the images involved the bondage, torture, and rape of prepubescent children. Further, Robinson did not just possess imageshe subscribed to a child pornography website and paid a fee for images.<sup>[2]</sup> The guidelines range reflected all of these considerations by adding thirteen points to Robinson's guidelines score. The district court did not address the enhancements which were applied in computing the guidelines range. Nor did it explain why Robinson's lack of a significant criminal record justified a major variance from the sentence recommended by the guidelines.</p>\n<p>The district court also stated that \"everyone would agree that especially if you're an organizer and a creator of this kind of material, a very severe sentence is warranted,\" and \"the most time [i.e., severe sentences] should go to the creators; the next most time to the distributors and/or possessors who may be prone to commit sexual offenses against children.\" (R. 25 at 18, 22.) We do not disagree with these statements. However, \"[t]hat the producers of child pornography are more culpable . . . does not mean that its knowing and deliberate possessors are barely culpable at all.\" <i>United States v. Bistline,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"620475\"><a href=\"/opinion/620475/united-states-v-bistline/\"><span class=\"volume\">665</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">758</span></a></span>, 765 (6th Cir.2012). Robinson knowingly acquired the images affirmatively, deliberately, and repeatedly, hundreds of times over the course of five years.</p>\n<p>The district court's sentence, however, did not adequately reflect that fact. Nor did the sentence itself reflect the seriousness of his crime, promote respect for the law, or provide just punishment for his offense.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Deterrence</h2>\n<p>Another § 3553(a) factor is \"the need for the sentence imposed . . . to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct[.]\" 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2)(B). The district court thought that factor was satisfied here because \"this is a sex offense . . . [making it] necessary for [Robinson] to register as a sex offender, which, by the way, is another element of deterrence both for you and for everybody else. Nobody wants to be on a list like that.\" (R. 25 at 29.) The district court also noted that \"[t]o the limited extent that anyone knows about [Robinson's] arrest, that's deterrence\"; and \"the fact that [Robinson was] caught and that gets out into the community, that will deter some other people\"; and \"sometimes the Government issues a press release . . . [a]nd three or 400 more people may read it or a thousand people, and some of those people might not do that conduct because they know . . . it's a felony conviction\"; and \"nothing I say here <span class=\"star-pagination\">*777</span> today will take out the fact that for the rest of your lifeyou're 43 years oldyou have a felony conviction: And that will deter people. And it will especially deter you.\" (R. 25 at 15.)</p>\n<p>However, these consequences do not arise from Robinson's sentence. Rather, they arise from his prosecution and conviction. Section 3553(a)(2)(B) plainly states that \"the <i>sentence</i> imposed\" should \"afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct\" (emphasis added). This is not reflected in Robinson's sentence. We have previously held that, under § 3553(a)(2)(B) and (C), deterring future criminal behavior and protecting the public as sentencing factors in a child pornography case should be focused upon the market for such activities. The emphasis should be upon deterring the production, distribution, receipt, or possession of child pornography, and not a prediction of future sexual contact with children. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Christman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"149121\"><a href=\"/opinion/149121/united-states-v-christman/\"><span class=\"volume\">607</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1110</span></a></span>, 1122-23 (6th Cir.2010). General deterrence is crucial in the child pornography context, as the Seventh Circuit has explained:</p>\n<blockquote>Young children were raped in order to enable the production of the pornography that the defendant both downloaded and uploaded. . . . The greater the customer demand for child pornography, the more that will be produced. Sentences influence behavior, or so at least Congress thought when in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) it made deterrence a statutory sentencing factor. The logic of deterrence suggests that the lighter the punishment for downloading and uploading child pornography, the greater the customer demand for it and so the more will be produced.</blockquote>\n<p><i>United States v. Goldberg,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"798197\"><a href=\"/opinion/798197/united-states-v-jeremy-goldberg/\"><span class=\"volume\">491</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span>, 672 (7th Cir.2007) (citations omitted); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Goff,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1460543\"><a href=\"/opinion/1460543/united-states-v-goff/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">250</span></a></span>, 261 (3d Cir.2007) (\"[D]eterring the production of child pornography and protecting the children who are victimized by it are factors that should have been given significant weight at sentencing, but in fact received not a word from the District Court.\").</p>\n<p>Robinson's sentence, which was devoid of any significant period of incarceration, home confinement, or substantial fine, undermines the purpose of general deterrence. As deterrence has both an individualized and more general component, particularly in the child pornography context, we do not see how Robinson's sentence would meaningfully deter anyone else.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. Sentence Disparities</h2>\n<p>Another factor is \"the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct[.]\" 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(6). The sentencing guidelines already take into consideration Robinson's lack of significant criminal history and specific conduct in violating 18 U.S.C. § 2252A(a)(5)(B). Yet his guidelines range was 78 to 97 months' imprisonment. As we articulated in <i>Bistline,</i> \"[w]e do not mean to imply that only a sentence in or around that range will avoid disparities with other similar defendants. But we do not see how the sentence imposed here avoids them.\" 665 F.3d at 767.</p>\n<p>At the sentencing hearing, the district court discussed several cases in which the Sixth Circuit affirmed sentences in child pornography cases that significantly varied from the guidelines. (R. 25 at 18-23.) The court noted that the cases involved \"distinguishing characteristics as to each individual\" and the decisions were \"distinguishable because the individual[s] involved [were] much more active in either creating or distributing the material.\" (R. 25 at 16, 21.) However, as we have stated before:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*778</span> [It] is not logical to justify a more lenient sentence on the basis that [the defendant] did not make or distribute child pornography or molest a child. Just as the federal sentencing laws impose greater sentences upon sellers of controlled substances than upon those who are caught possessing such substances. . . the federal child sexual offense laws do so as well. Indeed, the Sentencing Guidelines take into account only the criminal conduct of which [the defendant] was charged.</blockquote>\n<p><i>United States v. Camiscione,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1463472\"><a href=\"/opinion/1463472/united-states-v-camiscione/\"><span class=\"volume\">591</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">823</span></a></span>, 834 (6th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p>We note that the sentencing guidelines relating to child pornography have generated much controversy and are currently under review by the Sentencing Commission. This case is grimly typical in a number of aspects which enhanced the offense level under the guidelines. Robinson was assessed two extra levels for use of a computer, which now occurs in almost every case. Enhancements to the base offense level are meant to increase a sentence for conduct more aggravated than the typical type of offense, making this guideline an anomaly. In Robinson's case, he was assessed six additional levels because the visual conduct included depictions of prepubescent children being subjected to rape and sadomasochistic or violent conduct. These enhancements have received far less criticism than that of using a computer.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the most criticized enhancement involves the number of child pornography images possessed by a defendant. In this case, Robinson was assessed five levels because the offense involved more than 600 images. In a number of offense guidelines, amounts involved in criminal conduct are used to adjust the guidelines range by adding points to the base offense level; <i>e.g.,</i> drug quantities in § 2D1.1, amount of loss in § 2B1.1; number of firearms in § 2K2.1. <i>See</i> U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual §§ 2D1.1, 2B1.1, 2K2.1 (2011). In many cases, the extent and degree of criminal conduct bears a relationship to such quantifiable measurements.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>In the computer age, we have some doubt that the number of pictures alone captures the gravity of the crime of possession of child pornography. A defendant who knowingly shares files containing child pornography does not necessarily know the number to be received. A saver of files, who has viewed and traded as many images as a non-saver of files, is subjected to a far greater sentencing guidelines range.</p>\n<p>These issues bear upon the facts in this case. While this Court is not tasked with crafting sentencing guidelines or randomly critiquing the work of the Sentencing Commission, it is noteworthy that Robinson acquired a large number of images of child pornography over a five-year period. This fact seems much more appropriate to a sentencing enhancement under the guidelines than a large number of images, all of which could have been downloaded on a single day. Robinson paid money for some of the images and engaged in the criminal conduct over a long period of time, all of which are factors to be considered at sentencing. In sum, while aspects of the sentencing guidelines for child pornography have generated substantial controversy, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*779</span> two enhancements particular to this case make the conduct of the defendant more aggravating.</p>\n<p>We pause to explain why our decision in this case is not controlled by our decisions in <i>United States v. Stall,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1266442\"><a href=\"/opinion/1266442/united-states-v-stall/\"><span class=\"volume\">581</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">276</span></a></span> (6th Cir.2009) and <i>United States v. Prisel,</i> 316 Fed.Appx. 377 (6th Cir.2008), where we considered whether one-day sentences of imprisonment for possession of child pornography were substantively reasonable. In both cases, we affirmed the sentences under the more stringent plain-error standard of review. The sentences imposed in those cases, however, were more severe than Robinson's sentence. The sentences in <i>Stall</i> and <i>Prisel</i> imposed very restrictive conditions as part of the defendants' supervised release, as well as significant fines. <i>See </i><i>Stall,</i> 581 F.3d at 281 (affirming, under plain-error review, sentence of one day of imprisonment, ten years of supervised release, the first year of which was under home confinement, and $5,000 fine for possession of eighteen images of child pornography, where applicable guidelines range was 57 to 71 months); <i>Prisel,</i> 316 Fed.Appx. at 380 (affirming, under plain-error review, sentence of one day of imprisonment, three years of supervised release, the first eighteen months of which were under home confinement with electronic monitoring, and a $6,000 fine for possession of 1,189 images and five digital movies containing child pornography, where applicable guidelines range was 27 to 33 months). Unlike the facts in <i>Stall,</i> here, the district court did not conduct an \"extensive analysis of how a [five-year] term of supervised release would restrict [the defendant's] freedom and protect the public\" or explain \"why the district court believed this sentence will deter similar offenders and why this case warranted a variance.\" 581 F.3d at 287.</p>\n<p>Although the courts in <i>Stall</i> and <i>Prisel</i> rejected the applicable guidelines ranges, they nevertheless sentenced the defendants to lengthy periods of supervised releaseperiods of which required home confinementand substantial fines. Robinson's sentence of one day of imprisonment followed by a five-year term of supervised release under a recommended guidelines range of 78 to 97 months' imprisonment for possessing 7100 images of child pornography does not begin to approach the severity of the sentences imposed in <i>Stall</i> or <i>Prisel.</i></p>\n<p>Ultimately, the factors that the district court relied on, as articulated in the record, do not justify a variance of this size. Accordingly, we find the variance here to be substantively unreasonable based on the current record. \"[W]e recognize that our substantive review of sentences is deferential. . . [e]ven so, the sentence in this case can withstand review only if deference amounts to abdication[.]\" <i>United States v. Irey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"151874\"><a href=\"/opinion/151874/united-states-v-irey/\"><span class=\"volume\">612</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1160</span></a></span>, 1165 (11th Cir.2010) (en banc).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>We express no view as to an appropriate sentence upon remand to the district court. Fashioning an appropriate sentence is a most difficult task, particularly in a child pornography case. We recognize that in some cases there can be very different circumstances for which <i>Booker</i> now compels the district court judge to decide what the appropriate sentence may be. The crime of possessing child pornography is difficult to understand; some cases involve defendants with their own history of sexual abuse as a child, <i>see </i><i>United States v. Fink,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1235994\"><a href=\"/opinion/1235994/united-states-v-fink/\"><span class=\"volume\">502</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">585</span></a></span>, 587-88 (6th Cir.2007); others involve defendants with serious mental illness, <i>see </i><i>United States v. Brooks,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"182313\"><a href=\"/opinion/182313/united-states-v-brooks/\"><span class=\"volume\">628</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">791</span></a></span>, 794-98 (6th Cir.2011). To paraphrase <i>Gall,</i> extraordinary circumstances may justify extraordinary variances or departures. 552 U.S. at 50, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145843\"><a href=\"/opinion/145843/gall-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">586</span></a></span>. No <span class=\"star-pagination\">*780</span> such circumstances were identified by the district court as it imposed the sentence. We leave it to the district court to review all of the relevant facts and § 3553(a) factors to re-craft an appropriate sentence.</p>\n<p>For the reasons discussed above, we VACATE Robinson's sentence and REMAND for resentencing in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  The Honorable Edmund A. Sargus, Jr., United States District Judge for the Southern District of Ohio, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  <i>See</i> U.S.S.C., 2010 Sourcebook of Federal Sentencing Statistics, Table 28: Sentences Relative to the Guideline Range By Each Primary Sentencing Guideline; § 2G2.2 (Fiscal Year 2010) (\"2010 Sourcebook\"). In fiscal year 2010, the non-government sponsored below-guideline rate was 44.6%, the government sponsored below-guideline rate was 13.5%, and the above-guideline rate was 2.0%. <i>Id.</i> By comparison, for all offenders, the non-government sponsored below-guideline rate was 17.8%, the government sponsored below-guideline rate was 25.4%, and the above-guideline rate was 1.8%. 2010 Sourcebook, Table N: National Comparison of Sentence Imposed and Position Relative to the Guideline Range.</p>\n<p>[2]  The fact that Robinson paid money to a website could have justified a charge of receiving child pornography under 18 U.S.C. § 2252A(a)(2). This section defines distribution or receipt of child pornography as the same crime and imposes a mandatory five-year minimum sentence. In many cases, the distinction between possessing child pornography (which carries no mandatory minimum) and receiving child pornography (which carries the five-year mandatory minimum) is nonexistent. But paying a service for providing child pornography is qualitatively different than file sharing. We note that standing alone, the current statutory scheme makes no principled distinction between possessing and receiving child pornography, which can often times be virtually identical conduct, but nonetheless results in vastly different mandatory sentencing ranges.</p>\n<p>[3]  In many cases, the opposite may be true. In the case of a low level drug carrier who cannot access the trunk where the drugs are located, the quantity of drugs is not indicative of the gravity of the defendant's conduct. In many fraud cases, the amount of fraud depends upon fortuity, length of operation, or amount available. In other words, more would have been taken in some cases; in others, much smaller in scope, good or bad fortune drove the amount.</p>\n\n</div>",
