Clifford Leon Houston, Ten Mile, Tennessee, pro se.\n                                _________________\n\n                                     OPINION\n                                _________________\n\n        PER CURIAM. This matter is before us upon initial consideration to determine\nwhether Clifford Houston’s appeal is properly before the court.\n\n        The record establishes that the district court entered an order on November 3,\n2011, denying Houston’s third motion to recuse United States District Court Judge\nThomas W. Phillips. Houston filed his notice of appeal from that order on November 3,\n2011.\n\n\n\n\n                                          1\n\fNo. 11-6379         Houston v. Logan                                                 Page 2\n\n\n        Although an order denying recusal is generally not immediately appealable, it\nmay be reviewed in a mandamus proceeding. In re Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co., 919 F.2d\n1136, 1143 (6th Cir. 1990) (en banc). A notice of appeal from an order which is not\nimmediately appealable may be treated as a petition for a writ of mandamus. Van Meter\nv. State Farm Fire & Cas. Co., 1 F.3d 445, 451 n.3 (6th Cir. 1993), overruled on other\ngrounds by Blackburn v. Oaktree Capital Mgmt., LLC, 511 F.3d 633 (6th Cir. 2008);\nHammons v. Teamsters Local No. 20, 754 F.2d 177, 179 (6th Cir. 1985); see also\nGresham v. Corr. Med. Servs., Inc., 650 F.3d 628, 630 (6th Cir. 2011). However, “[t]he\nremedy of mandamus is a drastic one, to be invoked only in extraordinary situations\nwhere the petitioner can show a clear and indisputable right to the relief sought.” In re\nAm. President Lines, Ltd., 929 F.2d 226, 227 (6th Cir. 1991). An order denying recusal\nis reviewed for an abuse of discretion. Reed v. Rhodes, 179 F.3d 453, 467 n.1 (6th Cir.\n1999). Unfavorable rulings by a district court judge are almost never a sufficient basis\nupon which to infer bias, and this court is not convinced that the district court abused its\ndiscretion in denying recusal. Liteky v. United States, 510 U.S. 540, 555 (1994);\nWoodruff v. Tomlin, 593 F.2d 33, 44 (6th Cir. 1979).\n\n        In construing Houston’s notice of appeal as a petition for a writ of mandamus,\nwe find that the notice does not meet the requirements entitling Houston to mandamus\nrelief. See In re Metro. Gov’t of Nashville & Davidson Cnty., 606 F.3d 855, 863-64 (6th\nCir. 2010). Therefore, it is ordered that the appeal is dismissed, and the notice of appeal,\nconstrued as a petition for writ of mandamus, is denied. Houston may raise his recusal\nissues, however, in his appeal from the district court’s judgment in Houston v. Logan,\nNo. 3:11-cv-97 (E.D. Tenn. Dec. 21, 2011).\n\f",
