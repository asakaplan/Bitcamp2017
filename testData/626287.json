We disagree and AFFIRM.\n\n                                   I. BACKGROUND\n\n       On October 30, 2002, Jimmy Coleman was convicted of sexual battery, an\noffense requiring him to register as a sex offender under Ohio law. Three days before\nhe was released from prison, in July 2005, Coleman signed a notice acknowledging his\nduty to register personally in each county in Ohio, or any other state where he resided,\nupon five days of arriving there. He did not register in Ohio. Some time before SORNA\nwent into effect, Coleman moved permanently to Kentucky and again did not register.\nOn April 28, 2009, he was arrested for a parole violation. Coleman had made sporadic\ntrips from Kentucky to West Virginia between May 2008 and mid-February 2009,\nincluding several after SORNA became effective on August 1, 2008.\n\n       On August 6, 2009, the United States indicted Coleman on one count of violating\n18 U.S.C. § 2250(a), failure to register as a sex offender. On September 24, 2009,\nColeman filed a motion to dismiss the indictment, challenging the constitutionality of\n§ 2250(a). United States v. Coleman, Crim. No. 09-30-ART, 2009 WL 4255545, at *1\n(E.D. Ky. Nov. 24, 2009). The motion was denied. Id. On December 8, 2009, Coleman\npleaded guilty to violating § 2250(a). He reserved the right to appeal the district court’s\ndenial of his motion to dismiss the indictment. This appeal follows.\n\n                                     II. ANALYSIS\n\n       Congress enacted SORNA as part of the Adam Walsh Child Protection and\nSafety Act (“AWCPSA”). Carr v. United States, 130 S. Ct. 2229, 2232 (2010) (citing\nPub. L. No. 109-248, Tit. 1, 120 Stat. 590). The AWCPSA arose after previous, state-\ncentered attempts to regulate the interstate movement of unregistered sex offenders had\nfailed. Congress found that the state-based regime “left loopholes and gaps,” United\nStates v. Gould, 568 F.3d 459, 473 (4th Cir. 2009), allowing sex offenders to evade\nregistration requirements “when the sex offender moves from one State to another.”\nCarr, 130 S. Ct. at 2240 (quoting H.R. Rep. No. 109-218, pt. 1, at 26 (2005) (internal\n\fNo. 10-5283           United States v. Coleman                                            Page 3\n\n\nquotation marks removed)).            Consequently, by 2006, one fifth of all sex\noffenders—more than 100,000 people—had become “missing” from the system. Id.\n(quoting H.R. Rep. No. 109-218, pt. 1, at 26 (2005)).\n\n       Citing “a strong public interest in finding [unregistered sex offenders] and having\nthem register with current information,” H.R. Rep. No. 109-218, pt. 1, at 24 (2005),\nCongress enacted the AWCPSA. By this law, Congress created a national registry of sex\noffenders, allowing all states to access information from a single database. Additionally,\nthe AWCPSA enhanced registration requirements and interstate monitoring, so that “if\nthe sex offender either moves to a new State, works in a new State, or attends school in\na new State, the new State is required to notify the other State that the sex offender is\ndoing so in that State.” Id. at 26. SORNA enforces the requirements of the AWCPSA,\nproviding that:\n\n       (a) IN GENERAL.—Whoever—\n\n                  (1) is required to register under the Sex Offender Registration and\n                  Notification Act;\n                  (2) . . . (B) travels in interstate or foreign commerce, or enters or\n                  leaves, or resides in, Indian country; and\n                  (3) knowingly fails to register or update a registration as required\n                  by the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act;\n       shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 10 years, or\n       both.\n\n18 U.S.C. § 2250. Each of SORNA’s elements “must be satisfied in sequence,\nculminating in a post-SORNA failure to register.” Carr, 130 S. Ct. at 2235 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). While SORNA applies retroactively to all individuals\nconvicted of sexually oriented offenses regardless of the date of conviction, the elements\nof travel and of failure to register must both take place after the Attorney General made\nSORNA applicable to pre-enactment offenders on August 1, 2008. United States v.\nStevenson, — F.3d —, Nos. 10-1043, 10-1117, 2012 WL 573326, at *1 (6th Cir. Feb.\n23, 2012); United States v. Utesch, 596 F.3d 302, 311 (6th Cir. 2010); see Reynolds v.\nUnited States, 565 U.S. —, 132 S. Ct. 975, 980 (2012) (SORNA does not apply to pre-\n\fNo. 10-5283          United States v. Coleman                                       Page 4\n\n\nenactment offenders until the Attorney General so specifies); Carr, 130 S. Ct. at 2233\n(“Liability under § 2250, we hold, cannot be predicated on pre-SORNA travel.”).\n\n        Coleman challenges the district court’s application of SORNA to him as\nunconstitutional. First, he claims that SORNA violates the Ex Post Facto Clause of the\nConstitution, U.S. Const. art. I, § 9, cl. 3 by punishing him on the basis of pre-enactment\nconduct. Second, Coleman claims that SORNA is unconstitutional because it regulates\nconduct that falls outside the scope of Congress’s power under the Commerce Clause,\nU.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 3.\n\nA. Standard of Review\n\n        We review the denial of a motion to dismiss the indictment for an abuse of\ndiscretion. United States v. Middleton, 246 F.3d 825, 841 (6th Cir. 2001). We review\na district court’s determination of the constitutionality of federal statutes de novo.\nUnited States v. Napier, 233 F.3d 394, 397 (6th Cir. 2000).\n\nB. Ex Post Facto Clause Challenge\n\n        The Ex Post Facto Clause prohibits Congress from passing any law that\n(1) retroactively imposes punishment for an act that was not punishable when\ncommitted, (2) retroactively increases the punishment for a crime after its commission,\nor (3) deprives one charged with a crime of a defense that was available at the time the\ncrime was committed. Collins v. Youngblood, 497 U.S. 37, 42 (1990). Coleman\ncontends that, because the sentences for SORNA violations are tailored to the nature of\nthe defendant’s prior sex-offense convictions, SORNA actually punishes the prior sex\noffense and not the failure to register. Thus, applying SORNA to individuals who\ncommitted the underlying sex offense prior to its effective date retroactively increases\nthe punishment for the subject offense after its commission, bringing it into the second\ncategory of Ex Post Facto Clause violations. In United States v. Felts, we held that such\nan application of SORNA does not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause. — F.3d —, No.\n11-5237, 2012 WL 762977, at *5 (6th Cir. Mar. 12, 2012).\n\fNo. 10-5283        United States v. Coleman                                           Page 5\n\n\nC. Commerce Clause Challenge\n\n       Coleman’s second constitutional challenge alleges that SORNA exceeds the\nambit of Congress’s power “[t]o regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among\nthe several States, and with the Indian Tribes.” U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 3. In United\nStates v. Lopez, the Supreme Court articulated three broad categories of activity that\nCongress may regulate through its commerce power:\n\n       First, Congress may regulate the use of the channels of interstate\n       commerce. Second, Congress is empowered to regulate and protect the\n       instrumentalities of interstate commerce, or persons or things in interstate\n       commerce, even though the threat may come only from intrastate\n       activities. Finally, Congress’ commerce authority includes the power to\n       regulate those activities having a substantial relation to interstate\n       commerce.\n\n514 U.S. 549, 558-59 (1995) (internal citations omitted). We invalidate statutes only if\nthey bear no rational relationship to any of these powers. United States v. Faasse, 265\nF.3d 475, 481 (6th Cir. 2001) (en banc) (citing Hodel v. Va. Surface Mining &\nReclamation Ass’n, 452 U.S. 264, 276 (1981)).\n\n       Coleman argues that SORNA fits into none of the Lopez categories. He contends\nthat SORNA exceeds the first prong because, due to the fact that registration is not\nrequired until after the offender exits the stream of interstate commerce to settle in a\ngiven location, SORNA lacks a nexus to interstate commerce. He maintains that\nSORNA exceeds the second prong because its focus on offender registration, as opposed\nto offender travel, decouples it from any “instrumentality of interstate commerce” that\nCongress constitutionally may regulate. Finally, he alleges that SORNA exceeds the\nthird prong because it regulates activity with no cognizable relation to interstate\ncommerce, as neither travel nor registry “substantially affect” commerce.\n\n       None of these arguments is availing. We find that SORNA fits comfortably\nwithin the first two Lopez prongs. Accord United States v. George, 625 F.3d 1124,\n1129-30 (9th Cir. 2010), vacated on other grounds, — F.3d —, No. 08-30339, 2012 WL\n718297 (9th Cir. Mar. 7, 2012); United States v. DiTomasso, 621 F.3d 17, 26 (1st Cir.\n\fNo. 10-5283        United States v. Coleman                                        Page 6\n\n\n2010), vacated on other grounds in light of Reynolds by No. 10-8532, 2012 WL 538283\n(Feb. 21, 2012); United States v. Vasquez, 611 F.3d 325, 330-31 (7th Cir. 2010); United\nStates v. Shenandoah, 595 F.3d 151, 160 (3d Cir. 2010), abrogated on other grounds by\nReynolds, 565 U.S. at —, 132 S. Ct. at 980; United States v. Guzman, 591 F.3d 83, 89-92\n(2d Cir. 2010); United States v. Whaley, 577 F.3d 254, 259-61 (5th Cir. 2009); United\nStates v. Gould, 568 F.3d 459, 470-75 (4th Cir. 2009); United States v. Ambert, 561 F.3d\n1202, 1210-12 (11th Cir. 2009); United States v. Lawrance, 548 F.3d 1329, 1337 (10th\nCir. 2008); United States v. May, 535 F.3d 912, 921-22 (8th Cir. 2008), abrogated on\nother grounds by Reynolds, 565 U.S. at —, 132 S. Ct. at 980. We therefore decline to\naddress the third Lopez prong.\n\n       1. The First Lopez Prong\n\n       SORNA constitutes a valid regulation of the use of the channels of interstate\ncommerce. The “commerce” that Congress may regulate through the first Lopez prong\nis not limited to economic matters, but rather may encompass “using the channels of\ninterstate commerce to bring ‘the spread of any evil or harm to the people of other states\nfrom the state of origin.’” United States v. Al-Zubaidy, 283 F.3d 804, 811 (6th Cir. 2002)\n(quoting Brooks v. United States, 267 U.S. 432, 436 (1925)). Where a statute lacks a\nclear economic purpose, the inclusion of an explicit jurisdictional element suffices to\n“ensure, through case-by-case inquiry, that the [violation] in question affects interstate\ncommerce.” Lopez, 514 U.S. at 561.\n\n       Indeed, we regard the presence of such a jurisdictional element as the touchstone\nof valid congressional use of its Commerce Clause powers to regulate non-commercial\nactivity. To wit, after the Supreme Court struck down the civil remedies provision of\nthe Violence Against Women Act (“VAWA”), see United States v. Morrison, 529 U.S.\n598, 613 (2000), we upheld various criminal provisions of the same statute in both Al-\nZubaidy and United States v. Page, 167 F.3d 325, 325 (6th Cir. 1999) (en banc), cert.\ndenied, 528 U.S. 1003 (1999). In each case, the presence of a “jurisdictional element”\ninvolving interstate travel brought the criminal provision unquestionably within the first\nprong of Lopez. See Al-Zubaidy, 283 F.3d at 812 (“The language of the statute provides\n\fNo. 10-5283        United States v. Coleman                                         Page 7\n\n\nan explicit jurisdictional element requiring interstate travel, an element that reinforces\nits category one justification . . . .”); Page, 167 F.3d at 334-35 (Moore, J., concurring)\n(“Section 2261(a)(2) is similarly constitutional under the Commerce Clause because the\ninterstate domestic violence provision’s requirement of ‘the crossing of a state line . . .\nplac[es] the [commission of a crime of violence causing bodily injury] squarely in\ninterstate commerce.’”) (quoting United States v. Bailey, 112 F.3d 758, 766 (4th Cir.\n1997)) (alterations in Page). We have applied this same principle to other statutory\nschemes. See United States v. Chesney, 86 F.3d 564, 570 (6th Cir. 1996) (finding that\nthe presence of a jurisdictional element defeated defendant’s challenge to a felon-in-\npossession statute).\n\n       SORNA fits comfortably within this rubric. It contains an express jurisdictional\nelement, conditioning conviction under SORNA on the government proving that the\ndefendant has used the channels of interstate commerce by traveling to another state or\ncountry. See 18 U.S.C. § 2250(a)(2). Although not directed at economic activity,\nSORNA targets “the spread of [an] evil or harm” via the channels and instrumentalities\nof interstate commerce; namely, “the evasion of sex offender registration requirements\nby sex offenders who have crossed jurisdictional lines.” Lawrance, 548 F.3d at 1337.\nThus, we join several of our sister circuits in finding that SORNA’s jurisdictional\nelement, coupled with its purpose, creates the requisite nexus to the use of the channels\nof interstate commerce. See, e.g., George, 625 F.3d at 1130 (Ninth Circuit); DiTomasso,\n621 F.3d at 26 (First Circuit); United States v. Hinckley, 550 F.3d 926, 940 (10th Cir.\n2008), abrogated on other grounds by Reynolds v. United States, 565 U.S. at —, 132 S.\nCt. at 980; May, 535 F.3d at 922 (Eighth Circuit). That the culminating act—the failure\nto register—does not occur until the defendant exits the stream of interstate commerce\nis irrelevant to the constitutionality of the statute. Cf. Page, 167 F.3d at 334 (upon\ninclusion of a jurisdictional element, “[a]ny arguably intrastate nature or timing of the\ncrime . . . is irrelevant”). Accordingly, SORNA bears a rational relationship to\nCongress’s power to regulate the channels of interstate commerce.\n\fNo. 10-5283        United States v. Coleman                                         Page 8\n\n\n       2. The Second Lopez Prong\n\n       SORNA also constitutes a valid regulation of the instrumentalities of interstate\ncommerce. As Lopez explains, the “instrumentalities of interstate commerce” include\n“persons or things in interstate commerce.” 514 U.S. at 558. When Coleman traveled\nacross state lines, he became a “person . . . in interstate commerce.” Cf. Vasquez,\n611 F.3d at 330; Shenandoah, 595 F.3d at 161; Guzman, 591 F.3d at 90; Gould, 568 F.3d\nat 472; Ambert, 561 F.3d at 1211; Hinckley, 550 F.3d at 940; May, 535 F.3d at 921. As\nwith the first Lopez prong, it cannot be said that SORNA’s focus on Coleman’s failure\nto register as a sex offender so decouples the regulated conduct from the\ninstrumentalities of interstate commerce that it becomes unconstitutional. Rather, it\nsuffices that the government must prove that Coleman was a “person . . . in interstate\ncommerce” during a particular period, i.e., between the time that Coleman’s duty to\nregister under SORNA arose and when he failed to perform that duty. See Carr, 130 S.\nCt. at 2233.\n\n       Thus, SORNA fits squarely within Congress’s Commerce Clause powers and the\ndistrict court did not abuse its discretion by failing to dismiss the indictment.\n\n                                  III.

ANALYSIS</h2>\n<p>Congress enacted SORNA as part of the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act (\"AWCPSA\"). <i>Carr v. United States,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 130 S.Ct. 2229, 2232, 176 L.Ed.2d 1152 (2010) (citing Pub.L. No. 109-248, Tit. 1, 120 Stat. 590). The AWCPSA arose after previous, state-centered attempts to regulate the interstate movement of unregistered sex offenders had failed. Congress found that the state-based regime \"left loopholes and gaps,\" <i>United States v. Gould,</i> 568 F.3d 459, 473 (4th Cir.2009), allowing sex offenders to evade registration requirements \"when the sex offender moves from one State to another.\" <i>Carr,</i> 130 S.Ct. at 2240 (quoting H.R.Rep. No. 109-218, pt. 1, at 26 (2005) (internal quotation marks removed)). Consequently, by 2006, one fifth of all sex offendersmore than 100,000 peoplehad become \"missing\" from the system. <i>Id.</i> (quoting H.R.Rep. No. 109-218, pt. 1, at 26 (2005)).</p>\n<p>Citing \"a strong public interest in finding [unregistered sex offenders] and having them register with current information,\" H.R.Rep. No. 109-218, pt. 1, at 24 (2005), Congress enacted the AWCPSA. By this law, Congress created a national registry of sex offenders, allowing all states to access information from a single database. Additionally, the AWCPSA enhanced registration requirements and interstate monitoring, so that \"if the sex offender either moves to a new State, works in a new State, or attends school in a new State, the new State is required to notify the other State that the sex offender is doing so in that State.\" <i>Id.</i> at 26. SORNA enforces the requirements of the AWCPSA, providing that:</p>\n<blockquote>(a) IN GENERAL.Whoever</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(1) is required to register under the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(2) ... (B) travels in interstate or foreign commerce, or enters or leaves, or resides in, Indian country; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(3) knowingly fails to register or update a registration as required by the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 10 years, or both.</blockquote>\n<p>18 U.S.C. § 2250. Each of SORNA's elements \"must be satisfied in sequence, culminating in a post-SORNA failure to register.\" <i>Carr,</i> 130 S.Ct. at 2235 (internal quotation marks omitted). While SORNA applies retroactively to all individuals convicted of sexually oriented offenses regardless of the date of conviction, the elements of travel and of failure to register must both take place after the Attorney General made SORNA applicable to pre-enactment offenders on August 1, 2008. <i>United States v. Stevenson,</i> ___ F.3d ___, ___ (6th Cir.2012); <i>United States v. Utesch,</i> 596 F.3d 302, 311 (6th Cir.2010); <i>see </i><i>Reynolds v.

First, he claims that SORNA violates the Ex Post Facto Clause of the Constitution, U.S. Const. art. I, § 9, cl. 3 by punishing him on the basis of pre-enactment conduct. Second, Coleman claims that SORNA is unconstitutional because it regulates conduct that falls outside the scope of Congress's power under the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 3.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>A. Standard of Review</i></h2>\n<p>We review the denial of a motion to dismiss the indictment for an abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. Middleton,</i> 246 F.3d 825, 841 (6th Cir.2001). We review a district court's determination of the constitutionality of federal statutes de novo. <i>United States v. Napier,</i> 233 F.3d 394, 397 (6th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>B. Ex Post Facto Clause Challenge</i></h2>\n<p>The Ex Post Facto Clause prohibits Congress from passing any law that (1) retroactively imposes punishment for an act that was not punishable when committed, (2) retroactively increases the punishment for a crime after its commission, or (3) deprives one charged with a crime of a defense that was available at the time the crime was committed. <i>Collins v. Youngblood,</i> 497 U.S. 37, 42, 110 S.Ct. 2715, 111 L.Ed.2d 30 (1990). Coleman contends that, because the sentences for SORNA violations are tailored to the nature of the defendant's prior sex-offense convictions, SORNA actually punishes the prior sex offense and not the failure to register. Thus, applying SORNA to individuals who committed the underlying sex offense prior to its effective date retroactively increases the punishment for the subject offense after its commission, bringing it into the second category of Ex Post Facto Clause violations. In <i>United States v. Felts,</i> we held that such an application of SORNA does not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause. 674 F.3d 599, 605-06 (6th Cir. 2012).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>C. Commerce Clause Challenge</i></h2>\n<p>Coleman's second constitutional challenge alleges that SORNA exceeds the ambit of Congress's power \"[t]o regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes.\" U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 3. In <i>United States v. Lopez,</i> the Supreme Court articulated three broad categories of activity that Congress may regulate through its commerce power:</p>\n<blockquote>First, Congress may regulate the use of the channels of interstate commerce. Second, Congress is empowered to regulate and protect the instrumentalities of interstate commerce, or persons or things in interstate commerce, even though the threat may come only from intrastate activities. Finally, Congress' commerce authority includes the power to regulate those activities having a substantial relation to interstate commerce.</blockquote>\n<p>514 U.S. 549, 558-59, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 131 L.Ed.2d 626 (1995) (internal citations omitted). We invalidate statutes only if they bear no rational relationship to any of these powers. <i>United States v. Faasse,</i> 265 F.3d 475, 481 (6th Cir.2001) (en banc) (citing <i>Hodel v. Va. Surface Mining &amp; Reclamation Ass'n,</i> 452 U.S. 264, 276, 101 S.Ct. 2352, 69 L.Ed.2d 1 (1981)).</p>\n<p>Coleman argues that SORNA fits into none of the <i>Lopez</i> categories. He contends that SORNA exceeds the first prong <span class=\"star-pagination\">*620</span> because, due to the fact that registration is not required until after the offender exits the stream of interstate commerce to settle in a given location, SORNA lacks a nexus to interstate commerce. He maintains that SORNA exceeds the second prong because its focus on offender registration, as opposed to offender travel, decouples it from any \"instrumentality of interstate commerce\" that Congress constitutionally may regulate. Finally, he alleges that SORNA exceeds the third prong because it regulates activity with no cognizable relation to interstate commerce, as neither travel nor registry \"substantially affect\" commerce.</p>\n<p>None of these arguments is availing. We find that SORNA fits comfortably within the first two <i>Lopez</i> prongs. <i>Accord </i><i>United States v. George,</i> 625 F.3d 1124, 1129-30 (9th Cir.2010), <i>vacated on other grounds,</i> 672 F.3d 1126 (9th Cir.2012); <i>United States v.

We therefore decline to address the third <i>Lopez</i> prong.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<i>1. The First</i> Lopez <i>Prong</i>\n</h2>\n<p>SORNA constitutes a valid regulation of the use of the channels of interstate commerce. The \"commerce\" that Congress may regulate through the first <i>Lopez</i> prong is not limited to economic matters, but rather may encompass \"using the channels of interstate commerce to bring `the spread of any evil or harm to the people of other states from the state of origin.'\" <i>United States v. Al-Zubaidy,</i> 283 F.3d 804, 811 (6th Cir.2002) (quoting <i>Brooks v. United States,</i> 267 U.S. 432, 436, 45 S.Ct. 345, 69 L.Ed. 699 (1925)). Where a statute lacks a clear economic purpose, the inclusion of an explicit jurisdictional element suffices to \"ensure, through case-by-case inquiry, that the [violation] in question affects interstate commerce.\" <i>Lopez,</i> 514 U.S. at 561, 115 S.Ct. 1624.</p>\n<p>Indeed, we regard the presence of such a jurisdictional element as the touchstone of valid congressional use of its Commerce Clause powers to regulate non-commercial activity. To wit, after the Supreme Court struck down the civil remedies provision of the Violence Against Women Act (\"VAWA\"), <i>see </i><i>United States v. Morrison,</i> 529 U.S. 598, 613, 120 S.Ct. 1740, 146 L.Ed.2d 658 (2000), we upheld various criminal provisions of the same statute in both <i>Al-Zubaidy</i> and <i>United States v. Page,</i> 167 F.3d 325, 325 (6th Cir.1999) (en banc), <i>cert. denied,</i> 528 U.S. 1003, 120 S.Ct. 496, 145 L.Ed.2d 382 (1999). In each case, the presence of a \"jurisdictional element\" involving interstate travel brought the criminal provision unquestionably within the first prong of <i>Lopez. See Al-</i><i>Zubaidy,</i> 283 F.3d at 812 (\"The language of the statute provides an explicit jurisdictional element requiring interstate travel, an element that reinforces its category one justification....\"); <i>Page,</i> 167 F.3d at 334-35 (Moore, J., concurring) (\"Section 2261(a)(2) is similarly constitutional under the Commerce <span class=\"star-pagination\">*621</span> Clause because the interstate domestic violence provision's requirement of `the crossing of a state line ... plac[es] the [commission of a crime of violence causing bodily injury] squarely in interstate commerce.'\") (quoting <i>United States v. Bailey,</i> 112 F.3d 758, 766 (4th Cir.1997)) (alterations in <i>Page</i>). We have applied this same principle to other statutory schemes. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Chesney,</i> 86 F.3d 564, 570 (6th Cir.1996) (finding that the presence of a jurisdictional element defeated defendant's challenge to a felon-in-possession statute).</p>\n<p>SORNA fits comfortably within this rubric. It contains an express jurisdictional element, conditioning conviction under SORNA on the government proving that the defendant has used the channels of interstate commerce by traveling to another state or country. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. § 2250(a)(2). Although not directed at economic activity, SORNA targets \"the spread of [an] evil or harm\" via the channels and instrumentalities of interstate commerce; namely, \"the evasion of sex offender registration requirements by sex offenders who have crossed jurisdictional lines.\" <i>Lawrance,</i> 548 F.3d at 1337. Thus, we join several of our sister circuits in finding that SORNA's jurisdictional element, coupled with its purpose, creates the requisite nexus to the use of the channels of interstate commerce. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>George,</i> 625 F.3d at 1130 (Ninth Circuit); <i>DiTomasso,</i> 621 F.3d at 26 (First Circuit); <i>United States v. Hinckley,</i> 550 F.3d 926, 940 (10th Cir.2008), <i>abrogated on other grounds by </i><i>Reynolds v. United States,</i> 565 U.S. at ___, 132 S.Ct. at 980; <i>May,</i> 535 F.3d at 922 (Eighth Circuit). That the culminating actthe failure to register does not occur until the defendant exits the stream of interstate commerce is irrelevant to the constitutionality of the statute. <i>Cf. </i><i>Page,</i> 167 F.3d at 334 (upon inclusion of a jurisdictional element, \"[a]ny arguably intrastate nature or timing of the crime ... is irrelevant\"). Accordingly, SORNA bears a rational relationship to Congress's power to regulate the channels of interstate commerce.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<i>2. The Second</i> Lopez <i>Prong</i>\n</h2>\n<p>SORNA also constitutes a valid regulation of the instrumentalities of interstate commerce. As <i>Lopez</i> explains, the \"instrumentalities of interstate commerce\" include \"persons or things in interstate commerce.\" 514 U.S. at 558, 115 S.Ct. 1624. When Coleman traveled across state lines, he became a \"person ... in interstate commerce.\" <i>Cf. </i><i>Vasquez,</i> 611 F.3d at 330; <i>Shenandoah,</i> 595 F.3d at 161; <i>Guzman,</i> 591 F.3d at 90; <i>Gould,</i> 568 F.3d at 472; <i>Ambert,</i> 561 F.3d at 1211; <i>Hinckley,</i> 550 F.3d at 940; <i>May,</i> 535 F.3d at 921. As with the first <i>Lopez</i> prong, it cannot be said that SORNA's focus on Coleman's failure to register as a sex offender so decouples the regulated conduct from the instrumentalities of interstate commerce that it becomes unconstitutional. Rather, it suffices that the government must prove that Coleman was a \"person ... in interstate commerce\" during a particular period, <i>i.e.,</i> between the time that Coleman's duty to register under SORNA arose and when he failed to perform that duty. <i>See </i><i>Carr,</i> 130 S.Ct. at 2233.</p>\n<p>Thus, SORNA fits squarely within Congress's Commerce Clause powers and the district court did not abuse its discretion by failing to dismiss the indictment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.

He reserved the right to challenge the constitutionality of the statute. On appeal, Coleman contends that SORNA, as applied to him, violates the Ex Post Facto Clause and that it constitutes an invalid exercise of Congress's powers under the Commerce Clause. We disagree and AFFIRM.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>On October 30, 2002, Jimmy Coleman was convicted of sexual battery, an offense requiring him to register as a sex offender under Ohio law. Three days before he was released from prison, in July 2005, Coleman signed a notice acknowledging his duty to register personally in each county in Ohio, or any other state where he resided, upon five days of arriving there. He did not register in Ohio. Some time before SORNA went into effect, Coleman moved permanently to Kentucky and again did not register. On April 28, 2009, he was arrested for a parole violation. Coleman had made sporadic trips from Kentucky to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*618</span> West Virginia between May 2008 and mid-February 2009, including several after SORNA became effective on August 1, 2008.</p>\n<p>On August 6, 2009, the United States indicted Coleman on one count of violating 18 U.S.C. § 2250(a), failure to register as a sex offender. On September 24, 2009, Coleman filed a motion to dismiss the indictment, challenging the constitutionality of § 2250(a). <i>United States v. Coleman,</i> Crim.

Felts,</i> we held that such an application of SORNA does not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"625080\"><a href=\"/opinion/625080/united-states-v-felts/\"><span class=\"volume\">674</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">599</span></a></span>, 605-06 (6th Cir. 2012).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>C. Commerce Clause Challenge</i></h2>\n<p>Coleman's second constitutional challenge alleges that SORNA exceeds the ambit of Congress's power \"[t]o regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes.\" U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 3. In <i>United States v. Lopez,</i> the Supreme Court articulated three broad categories of activity that Congress may regulate through its commerce power:</p>\n<blockquote>First, Congress may regulate the use of the channels of interstate commerce. Second, Congress is empowered to regulate and protect the instrumentalities of interstate commerce, or persons or things in interstate commerce, even though the threat may come only from intrastate activities. Finally, Congress' commerce authority includes the power to regulate those activities having a substantial relation to interstate commerce.</blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117927\"><a href=\"/opinion/117927/united-states-v-lopez/\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">549</span></a></span>, 558-59, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117927\"><a href=\"/opinion/117927/united-states-v-lopez/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

He contends that SORNA exceeds the first prong <span class=\"star-pagination\">*620</span> because, due to the fact that registration is not required until after the offender exits the stream of interstate commerce to settle in a given location, SORNA lacks a nexus to interstate commerce. He maintains that SORNA exceeds the second prong because its focus on offender registration, as opposed to offender travel, decouples it from any \"instrumentality of interstate commerce\" that Congress constitutionally may regulate. Finally, he alleges that SORNA exceeds the third prong because it regulates activity with no cognizable relation to interstate commerce, as neither travel nor registry \"substantially affect\" commerce.</p>\n<p>None of these arguments is availing.

The First</i> Lopez <i>Prong</i>\n</h2>\n<p>SORNA constitutes a valid regulation of the use of the channels of interstate commerce. The \"commerce\" that Congress may regulate through the first <i>Lopez</i> prong is not limited to economic matters, but rather may encompass \"using the channels of interstate commerce to bring `the spread of any evil or harm to the people of other states from the state of origin.'\" <i>United States v. Al-Zubaidy,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"776926\"><a href=\"/opinion/776926/united-states-v-emad-al-zubaidy/\"><span class=\"volume\">283</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">804</span></a></span>, 811 (6th Cir.2002) (quoting <i>Brooks v.

Where a statute lacks a clear economic purpose, the inclusion of an explicit jurisdictional element suffices to \"ensure, through case-by-case inquiry, that the [violation] in question affects interstate commerce.\" <i>Lopez,</i> 514 U.S. at 561, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117927\"><a href=\"/opinion/117927/united-states-v-lopez/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

To wit, after the Supreme Court struck down the civil remedies provision of the Violence Against Women Act (\"VAWA\"), <i>see </i><i>United States v. Morrison,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118363\"><a href=\"/opinion/118363/united-states-v-morrison/\"><span class=\"volume\">529</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">598</span></a></span>, 613, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118363\"><a href=\"/opinion/118363/united-states-v-morrison/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Page,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"761544\"><a href=\"/opinion/761544/united-states-v-derek-duane-page/\"><span class=\"volume\">167</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">325</span></a></span>, 325 (6th Cir.1999) (en banc), <i>cert. denied,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">528</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1003</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">382</span></span> (1999). In each case, the presence of a \"jurisdictional element\" involving interstate travel brought the criminal provision unquestionably within the first prong of <i>Lopez. See Al-</i><i>Zubaidy,</i> 283 F.3d at 812 (\"The language of the statute provides an explicit jurisdictional element requiring interstate travel, an element that reinforces its category one justification....\"); <i>Page,</i> 167 F.3d at 334-35 (Moore, J., concurring) (\"Section 2261(a)(2) is similarly constitutional under the Commerce <span class=\"star-pagination\">*621</span> Clause because the interstate domestic violence provision's requirement of `the crossing of a state line ... plac[es] the [commission of a crime of violence causing bodily injury] squarely in interstate commerce.'\") (quoting <i>United States v. Bailey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"740244\"><a href=\"/opinion/740244/united-states-v-christopher-j-bailey/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">758</span></a></span>, 766 (4th Cir.1997)) (alterations in <i>Page</i>). We have applied this same principle to other statutory schemes. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Chesney,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"719755\"><a href=\"/opinion/719755/united-states-v-gary-e-chesney/\"><span class=\"volume\">86</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">564</span></a></span>, 570 (6th Cir.1996) (finding that the presence of a jurisdictional element defeated defendant's challenge to a felon-in-possession statute).</p>\n<p>SORNA fits comfortably within this rubric. It contains an express jurisdictional element, conditioning conviction under SORNA on the government proving that the defendant has used the channels of interstate commerce by traveling to another state or country. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. § 2250(a)(2). Although not directed at economic activity, SORNA targets \"the spread of [an] evil or harm\" via the channels and instrumentalities of interstate commerce; namely, \"the evasion of sex offender registration requirements by sex offenders who have crossed jurisdictional lines.\" <i>Lawrance,</i> 548 F.3d at 1337. Thus, we join several of our sister circuits in finding that SORNA's jurisdictional element, coupled with its purpose, creates the requisite nexus to the use of the channels of interstate commerce. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>George,</i> 625 F.3d at 1130 (Ninth Circuit); <i>DiTomasso,</i> 621 F.3d at 26 (First Circuit); <i>United States v. Hinckley,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"171479\"><a href=\"/opinion/171479/united-states-v-hinckley/\"><span class=\"volume\">550</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">926</span></a></span>, 940 (10th Cir.2008), <i>abrogated on other grounds by </i><i>Reynolds v. United States,</i> 565 U.S. at ___, 132 S.Ct. at 980; <i>May,</i> 535 F.3d at 922 (Eighth Circuit). That the culminating actthe failure to register does not occur until the defendant exits the stream of interstate commerce is irrelevant to the constitutionality of the statute. <i>Cf. </i><i>Page,</i> 167 F.3d at 334 (upon inclusion of a jurisdictional element, \"[a]ny arguably intrastate nature or timing of the crime ... is irrelevant\"). Accordingly, SORNA bears a rational relationship to Congress's power to regulate the channels of interstate commerce.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<i>2. The Second</i> Lopez <i>Prong</i>\n</h2>\n<p>SORNA also constitutes a valid regulation of the instrumentalities of interstate commerce. As <i>Lopez</i> explains, the \"instrumentalities of interstate commerce\" include \"persons or things in interstate commerce.\" 514 U.S. at 558, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117927\"><a href=\"/opinion/117927/united-states-v-lopez/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1624</span></a></span>. When Coleman traveled across state lines, he became a \"person ... in interstate commerce.\" <i>Cf. </i><i>Vasquez,</i> 611 F.3d at 330; <i>Shenandoah,</i> 595 F.3d at 161; <i>Guzman,</i> 591 F.3d at 90; <i>Gould,</i> 568 F.3d at 472; <i>Ambert,</i> 561 F.3d at 1211; <i>Hinckley,</i> 550 F.3d at 940; <i>May,</i> 535 F.3d at 921. As with the first <i>Lopez</i> prong, it cannot be said that SORNA's focus on Coleman's failure to register as a sex offender so decouples the regulated conduct from the instrumentalities of interstate commerce that it becomes unconstitutional. Rather, it suffices that the government must prove that Coleman was a \"person ... in interstate commerce\" during a particular period, <i>i.e.,</i> between the time that Coleman's duty to register under SORNA arose and when he failed to perform that duty. <i>See </i><i>Carr,</i> 130 S.Ct. at 2233.</p>\n<p>Thus, SORNA fits squarely within Congress's Commerce Clause powers and the district court did not abuse its discretion by failing to dismiss the indictment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.
