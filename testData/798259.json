Marbley, United States District Judge for the Southern District of\nOhio, sitting by designation.\n\n\n                                                  1\n\fNo. 09-5568            United States v. Clay                                                        Page 2\n\n\n         KETHLEDGE, Circuit Judge, dissenting from the denial of rehearing en banc.\nThis case presents two significant and recurring issues on which our court has express\nintra-circuit conflicts.        The first issue—on which there is also an inter-circuit\nsplit—concerns our standard of review with respect to a district court’s determination\nthat bad-acts evidence is admissible for a proper purpose under Federal Rule of Evidence\n404(b). The panel majority reviewed this determination de novo, and reversed the\ndistrict court. See Op. at 5. I would have reviewed this determination for an abuse of\ndiscretion (and affirmed), not only because that is the standard the Supreme Court has\ntold us to use for evidentiary decisions, but also because the determination rests\nprimarily upon the district court’s superior understanding of the issues and evidence at\ntrial. See Gen. Elec. Co. v. Joiner, 522 U.S. 136, 141 (1997); Sprint/United Mgmt. Co.\nv. Mendelsohn, 552 U.S. 379, 384 (2008) (“In deference to a district court’s familiarity\nwith the details of the case and its greater experience in evidentiary matters, courts of\nappeals afford broad discretion to a district court’s evidentiary rulings”). Specifically,\nonce the district court identifies one of the purposes listed in Rule 404(b), the question\nthen becomes whether, given the issues and evidence in the case, the proposed bad-acts\nevidence sufficiently aligns with that purpose. The district court knows that ground\nbetter than we do. But the more important point is that our decisions show one panel\nafter another disagreeing with each other in published opinions discussing the issue.1\nWe ought to clean up our law on this issue.\n\n\n\n\n         1\n            See, e.g., United States v. Murphy, 241 F.3d 447, 450 (6th Cir. 2001) (applying de novo review);\nUnited States v. Mack, 258 F.3d 548, 553 n.1 (6th Cir. 2001) (disagreeing that “we should review de novo\nthe district court’s decision that the evidence was admissible for a proper purpose”); United States v.\nHaywood, 280 F.3d 715, 720 (6th Cir. 2002) (rejecting precisely the standard of review that the majority\nemployed in this case); United States v. Perry, 438 F.3d 642, 647 (6th Cir. 2006) (applying de novo\nreview); United States v. Matthews, 440 F.3d 818, 828 (6th Cir. 2006) (same); United States v. Ayoub, 498\nF.3d 532, 547 (6th Cir. 2007) (same); United States v. Love, 254 F. App’x 511, 513-14 (6th Cir. 2007)\n(“This court’s precedent is inconsistent regarding what standard of review applies,” but “to the extent that\ncases after Haywood and Mack apply the three-tiered standard of review, they are errant”); United States\nv. Bell, 516 F.3d 432, 440 (6th Cir. 2008) (applying de novo review); United States v. Hembree, 312 F.\nApp’x 720, 723-24 (6th Cir. 2008) (same); United States v. Jenkins, 593 F.3d 480, 484 (6th Cir. 2010)\n(applying abuse-of-discretion review); United States v. Allen, 619 F.3d 518, 524 n.2 (6th Cir. 2010) (noting\nthat this circuit has “repudiated the three-tiered standard of review for Rule 404(b) determinations in light\nof” Joiner); United States v. Hardy, 643 F.3d 143, 150 (6th Cir. 2011) (applying abuse-of-discretion\nreview); United States v. Heard, No. 08-1426, 2012 WL 636789, at *4 (6th Cir. Feb. 29, 2012)\n(disagreeing with Ayoub, 498 F.3d at 547).\n\fNo. 09-5568        United States v. Clay                                           Page 3\n\n\n       The Supreme Court has encountered the same situation in an analogous context.\nIn Cooter & Gell v. Hartmax Corporation, for instance, the Court addressed the question\n“whether the court of appeals must defer to the district court’s legal conclusions in Rule\n11 proceedings[,]” where the standard of review is otherwise abuse of discretion. 496\nU.S. 384, 401 (1990). And the Court held that, for legal and factual questions alike that\nrequire “‘fact-intensive, close calls,’” we should apply a “unitary abuse-of-discretion\nstandard.” Id. at 403, 404 (citation omitted). The question whether bad-acts evidence\nwas admitted for a proper purpose under Rule 404(b) is such an issue.\n\n       The mere tincture of a legal issue, in a question predominately factual, should not\nbe enough to vaporize the deference we owe the district court. And there is no disputing\nthat the evidentiary issues presented in this case are predominantly factual. As it turns\nout, there is a circuit split on this issue: compare United States v. Green, 617 F.3d 233,\n239 (3d Cir. 2010) (applying de novo review to a district court’s determination of proper\npurpose under Rule 404(b)) and United States v. Akin, 213 F. App’x 606, 608 (9th Cir.\n2006) (per curiam) (same) and United States v. Plumman, 409 F.3d 919, 928 (8th Cir.\n2005) (applying de novo review to the district court’s “‘interpretation and application’”\nof Rule 404(b) (citation omitted)) with United States v. Hite, 364 F.3d 874, 881 n.10 (7th\nCir. 2004) vacated on other grounds by 543 U.S. 1103 (2005) (rejecting de novo review\nfor this same issue) and United States v. Gilbert, 229 F.3d 15, 20-21 (1st Cir. 2000)\n(holding that, unless the district court “misapprehended the scope of [Rule 404(b)],” “we\nreview its application of Rule[] 404(b) . . . to the proffered evidence only for an abuse\nof discretion”); see also United States v. Osorio, 288 F. App’x 971, 974 (5th Cir. 2008)\n(per curiam) (applying a “heightened abuse-of-discretion standard” in reviewing the\nadmission of evidence under Rule 404(b)). The circuits are also split (sometimes\ninternally) on essentially the same issue in the context of other evidentiary rules.\nCompare United States v. Tatum, No. 10-2625, 2012 WL 573959, at *3 (6th Cir. Feb.\n23, 2012) (“[W]e review de novo the court’s ultimate legal conclusion that the\nstatements may be received as non-hearsay”) and United States v. Ferguson, __ F.3d __,\n2011 WL 6351862, at *17 (2d Cir. Aug. 1, 2011) (applying de novo review to the\nquestion whether evidence is hearsay) and Mahone v. Lehman, 347 F.3d 1170, 1171 (9th\n\fNo. 09-5568        United States v. Clay                                         Page 4\n\n\nCir. 2003) (applying de novo review to “‘construction of the hearsay rule’” (citation\nomitted)) with United States v. Brown, 669 F.3d 10, 22 (1st Cir. 2012) (reviewing\nadmission of purported hearsay for an abuse of discretion) and United States v. Tran,\n568 F.3d 1156, 1162 (9th Cir. 2009) (reviewing for an abuse of discretion the decision\nthat a statement is admissible hearsay) and United States v. Lopez-Garcia, No. 98-2252,\n1999 WL 707783, at *2 (10th Cir. Aug. 18, 1999) (applying abuse-of-discretion review\nto a decision whether evidence is hearsay) and Trepel v. Roadway Express, Inc., 194\nF.3d 708, 716-17 (6th Cir. 1999) (rejecting de novo review of the district court’s\ndecision whether evidence is inadmissible hearsay); compare also Echo, Inc. v.\nTimberland Machs. & Irrigation, Inc., 661 F.3d 959, 963 (7th Cir. 2011) (reviewing de\nnovo the admissibility of testimony as lay opinion) with United States v. Jayyousi, 657\nF.3d 1085, 1102 (11th Cir. 2011) (applying abuse-of-discretion review to “ruling\nregarding the admissibility of the agent’s lay testimony”) and United States v. El-\nMezain, 664 F.3d 467, 511 (5th Cir. 2011) (same). So perhaps eventually the Supreme\nCourt will remind us again that “abuse of discretion is the proper standard of review of\na district court’s evidentiary rulings.” Joiner, 522 U.S. at 141.\n\n       The second intra-circuit conflict concerns the showing necessary to admit\nevidence of a defendant’s prior crimes under Rule 404(b). For years, the test for\nadmitting such evidence had been whether the defendant’s conduct in the prior crime\nwas “sufficiently analogous to support an inference” that the defendant intended to\nengage in similar conduct in the events giving rise to the pending case. See United\nStates v. Benton, 852 F.2d 1456, 1468 (6th Cir. 1988). That test was more flexible—and\nthus easier to meet—than the test announced in United States v. Bell, 516 F.3d 432 (6th\nCir. 2008). There, we held that prior-crimes evidence is admissible only if the prior\ncrime was “part of the same scheme or involved a similar modus operandi[.]” Id. at 443.\nHere, the majority applied the Bell test, whereas I would have applied the Benton\none—which other circuits apply as well. See United States v. LeCroy, 441 F.3d 914,\n918, 926 (11th Cir. 2006); United States v. Shadletsky, 491 F.2d 677, 677-78 (5th Cir.\n1974). But again the relevant point is that we have one panel after another disagreeing\n\fNo. 09-5568            United States v. Clay                                                       Page 5\n\n\nwith each other as to which of these tests controls.2 The practical result should be\nintolerable: in our circuit even the most conscientious district-court judge cannot tell\nwhat the law is on this important issue.\n\n         I respectfully dissent from the denial of rehearing.\n\n                                                      ENTERED BY ORDER OF THE COURT\n\n\n                                                             /s/ Leonard Green\n                                                     ___________________________________\n                                                                    Clerk\n\n\n\n\n         2\n          See United States v. Stephens, 549 F.3d 459, 463 (6th Cir. 2008) (applying Bell); United States\nv. Freeman, 412 F. App’x 735, 745 (6th Cir. 2010) (same); United States v. Hardy, 643 F.3d 143, 152 (6th\nCir. 2011) (“Bell is inconsistent with prior precedent and is therefore not controlling”); United States v.\nDelaney, 443 F.

Accordingly, the petition is denied.</p>\n<p>KETHLEDGE, Circuit Judge, dissenting from the denial of rehearing en banc.</p>\n<p>This case presents two significant and recurring issues on which our court has express intra-circuit conflicts. The first issueon which there is also an inter-circuit splitconcerns our standard of review with respect to a district court's determination that bad-acts evidence is admissible for a proper purpose under Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b). The panel majority reviewed this determination de novo, and reversed the district court. <i>See</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"620563\"><a href=\"/opinion/620563/united-states-v-clay/\"><span class=\"volume\">667</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">689</span></a></span>, 693. I would have reviewed this determination for an abuse of discretion (and affirmed), not only because that is the standard the Supreme Court has told us to use for evidentiary decisions, but also because the determination rests primarily upon the district court's superior understanding of the issues and evidence at trial. <i>See </i><i>Gen.

Specifically, once the district court identifies one of the purposes listed in Rule 404(b), the question then becomes whether, given the issues and evidence in the case, the proposed bad-acts evidence sufficiently aligns with that purpose. The district court knows that ground better than we do. But the more important point is that our decisions show one panel after another disagreeing with each other in published opinions discussing the issue.<sup>[1]</sup> We ought to clean up our law on this issue.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court has encountered the same situation in an analogous context. In <span class=\"star-pagination\">*755</span> <i>Cooter &amp; Gell v. Hartmarx Corporation,</i> for instance, the Court addressed the question \"whether the court of appeals must defer to the district court's legal conclusions in Rule 11 proceedings[,]\" where the standard of review is otherwise abuse of discretion. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112457\"><a href=\"/opinion/112457/cooter-gell-v-hartmarx-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">496</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">384</span></a></span>, 401, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112457\"><a href=\"/opinion/112457/cooter-gell-v-hartmarx-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

And the Court held that, for legal and factual questions alike that require \"`fact-intensive, close calls,'\" we should apply a \"unitary abuse-of-discretion standard.\" <i>Id.</i> at 403, 404, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112457\"><a href=\"/opinion/112457/cooter-gell-v-hartmarx-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The question whether bad-acts evidence was admitted for a proper purpose under Rule 404(b) is such an issue.</p>\n<p>The mere tincture of a legal issue, in a question predominately factual, should not be enough to vaporize the deference we owe the district court. And there is no disputing that the evidentiary issues presented in this case are predominantly factual. As it turns out, there is a circuit split on this issue: <i>compare </i><i>United States v.

For years, the test for admitting such evidence had been whether the defendant's conduct in the prior crime was \"sufficiently analogous to support an inference\" that the defendant intended to engage in similar conduct in the events giving rise to the pending case. <i>See </i><i>United States v.
