Plaintiff-Appellant Jeffrey Kalich\nfiled a complaint against his former employer, Defendant-Appellee AT&T Mobility,\nLLC, (“AT&T”), in state court pursuant to Michigan’s Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act\n(“ELCRA”). Kalich alleged that his immediate supervisor David Rich created a hostile\nwork environment by subjecting Kalich to comments that constituted sexual harassment.\nAT&T removed the action to federal court. On November 2, 2010, the district court\ngranted AT&T’s motion for summary judgment, finding that Kalich’s claims were not\n\n\n\n\n                                          1\n\fNo. 10-2554        Kalich v. AT&T                                                Page 2\n\n\nactionable under the sexual harassment hostile work environment provisions of ELCRA.\nKalich appealed. For the reasons stated herein, we AFFIRM.\n\n                                   I. BACKGROUND\n\n       On May 19, 2008, AT&T hired Kalich as a retail store manager in Clarkston,\nMichigan. Rich, AT&T’s area sales manager, was Kalich’s immediate supervisor. Rich\nvisited Kalich’s store approximately ten times per month. During the course of Kalich’s\nemployment, Rich made various comments to Kalich that Kalich found upsetting and\noffensive. These comments are summarized chronologically as follows:\n\n       On June 12, 2008, Rich said to Kalich, “Oh I like your glasses. You should\nchange your name to Virginia or Margaret. No. I like Virginia the best.” Throughout\nthe rest of that day, Rich continued to refer to Kalich as Virginia, Margaret, and Peggy\nin front of other staff members.\n\n       On August 7, 2008, Rich made remarks about Kalich’s dog, a Yorkshire terrier.\nRich asked Kalich, “What kind of dog is that? Oh, how cute. It figures.” Rich later\nsaid, “That’s the perfect dog for you. What’s his name? Fluffy, Oliver? Okay. Tell\nOscar–I mean Oliver or Fluffy or whatever hello.” Thereafter, Rich regularly referred\nto Kalich’s dog by the names of Fluffy or Princess.\n\n       On December 11, 2008, Rich said to Kalich, “What? Do you not eat? You are\nwasting away. Your pants don’t even fit you right anymore. You look like a girl.”\nKalich alleges Rich made these remarks while laughing, staring at Kalich’s behind, and\nstaring and pointing at Kalich’s pants.\n\n       On February 13, 2009, Rich asked Kalich whether the human rights sticker on\nhis vehicle was a “Swedish flag.” Rich asked, “What kind of flag is that on your car, a\nSwedish one?” Despite Kalich’s explanation that the sticker was a symbol of equal\nrights, Rich persisted in referring to it as a “Swedish flag.”\n\fNo. 10-2554        Kalich v. AT&T                                                 Page 3\n\n\n       On February 23, 2009, Rich told Kalich he should change his name to Peggy,\nMargaret, Mary Ann, or Susan. Rich then said, “No. I still like Virginia. Or how about\nKristine, like your mom?” Rich made these comments in front of Kalich’s employees.\n\n       On March 16, 2009, Rich said to Kalich, “You should sew Kristine a quilt.\nCome on, Virginia. You know you can sew. Dear, you know you can do it.”\n\n       According to Kalich, Rich repeatedly and regularly made comments like those\ndetailed above, but Kalich was only able to make notes of the comments on isolated\noccasions.\n\n       AT&T has a Code of Business Conduct that forbids unlawful harassment of any\nkind, including sexual harassment. The Code provides internal procedures by which\nemployees can report violations. Rather than pursue these internal options, Kalich\nretained an attorney in March 2009. Kalich’s attorney sent a letter to Ken Gaffga, Rich’s\nsupervisor, on March 19, 2009. The letter described Rich’s comments and conduct\ntowards Kalich and demanded that the conduct cease immediately. The letter further\nasked that Kalich “be placed in a work environment free of gender based [sic]\nharassment” and that “labor relations and/or AT&T’s counsel contact me forthwith”\nregarding resolution of Kalich’s complaints.\n\n       On March 25, 2009, Rich allegedly called Kalich a necrophiliac, laughed, and\nstated in the presence of Kalich’s employees that Kalich had sex with dead people.\nAlthough Kalich had no further contact with Rich after this incident, Rich allegedly\nmade similar comments the following day in the presence of several of Kalich’s co-\nworkers. Rich later stated that he confused “narcolepsy,” a condition from which Kalich\napparently suffers, with necrophilia, and that this confusion led him to make a comment\nabout Kalich being a necrophiliac. At the time he made the necrophilia comment, Rich\nwas not yet aware of the letter that Kalich’s attorney sent to Gaffga complaining of\nRich’s comments.\n\n       Sometime during the first week of April, Kalich requested a thirty-day leave of\nabsence. Gaffga denied Kalich’s request, but authorized Kalich to take six days off.\n\fNo. 10-2554         Kalich v. AT&T                                                    Page 4\n\n\nAlso in the beginning of April 2009, AT&T’s equal employment opportunity (“EEO”)\ndepartment began an investigation in response to Kalich’s complaint. On April 9, 2009,\nGaffga informed Kalich that Rich would be transferred and would no longer oversee\noperations at Kalich’s store. In addition, Rich was given a final written warning for his\ninappropriate comments and would be required to take classes focused on promoting a\nprofessional work environment.\n\n        On April 13, 2009, while on his leave of absence, Kalich notified AT&T of his\nresignation. Kalich explained that the dynamics of the work environment had changed\nas a result of the EEO investigation, which included interviews with all of the store\nemployees. In addition, Kalich feared that, despite being re-assigned to the supervision\nof Susan Suppley, he might nevertheless encounter Rich on occasion. Kalich was\nuncomfortable with the prospect of future encounters with Rich and, therefore, “for\nmental and physical health reasons . . . felt it in [his] best interest to resign.” Kalich’s\nlast day of employment with AT&T was April 29, 2009.\n\n        Kalich contends that Rich’s conduct amounted to sexual harassment that created\na hostile work environment. In his complaint, Kalich sought to impose liability on\nAT&T for Rich’s conduct pursuant to ELCRA, Michigan’s civil rights statute. After the\nclose of discovery, the district court granted AT&T’s motion for summary judgment,\nfinding that Kalich had failed to present evidence in support of each element of his\nclaim. Kalich timely appealed.\n\n                                     II. ANALYSIS\n\n        We review a district court’s order granting summary judgment de novo. Int’l\nUnion v. Cummins, Inc., 434 F.3d 478, 483 (6th Cir. 2006). Summary judgment is\nproper “if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and\nthe movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). After\nadequate time for discovery and upon motion, summary judgment is proper against a\nparty who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element\nessential to that party’s case, and upon which that party bears the burden of proof at trial.\nCelotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322 (1986).\n\fNo. 10-2554        Kalich v. AT&T                                                  Page 5\n\n\n       ELCRA prohibits employers from discriminating against employees based on\nsex, which includes sexual harassment. See Mich. Comp. Laws § 37.2102; Chambers\nv. Trettco, Inc., 614 N.W.2d 910, 915 (Mich. 2000). Michigan law defines “sexual\nharassment” as “unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other\nverbal or physical conduct or communication of a sexual nature” under circumstances\nwhere submission to the conduct or communication is made a “quid pro quo” of gaining\nor keeping employment or where the conduct or communication “has the purpose or\neffect of substantially interfering with an individual’s employment. . . .” Mich. Comp.\nLaws § 37.2103(i).\n\n       Sexual harassment that substantially interferes with an individual’s employment\nis referred to as “hostile work environment” harassment. Radtke v. Everett, 501 N.W.2d\n155, 161 (Mich. 1993). Kalich does not allege that Rich conditioned his continued\nemployment upon submission to any sexual advances or overtures. Rather, Kalich\nalleges that Rich’s conduct created a hostile work environment. To establish a prima\nfacie case of hostile work environment based on sexual harassment, Kalich was required\nto present evidence that: (1) he belonged to a protected group; (2) he was subjected to\ncommunication or conduct on the basis of sex; (3) he was subjected to unwelcome\nsexual conduct or communication; (4) the unwelcome conduct or communication was\nintended to or did substantially interfere with the plaintiff’s employment or created an\nintimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment; and (5) respondeat superior.\nHaynie v. State, 664 N.W.2d 129, 133 (Mich. 2003); Chambers, 614 N.W.2d at 915.\n\n       In granting AT&T’s motion, the district court found that there was no dispute of\nmaterial fact and that Kalich failed to present sufficient evidence on each element of his\nclaim to withstand summary judgment. The court described Rich’s conduct as “crude,\nbullying, [and] despicable” but found that it was “not actionable under the sexual\nharassment hostile work environment provisions of ELCRA.” We agree.\n\fNo. 10-2554           Kalich v. AT&T                                                         Page 6\n\n\nA. Protected Group\n\n        As to the first element of a hostile work environment sexual harassment claim,\nKalich met his burden. The Michigan Supreme Court has held that “all employees are\ninherently members of a protected class in hostile work environment cases because all\npersons may be discriminated against on the basis of sex.” Haynie, 664 N.W.2d at 133\n(quoting Radtke, 501 N.W.2d at 162). Accordingly, Kalich presented sufficient evidence\nof the first element of his prima facie case.\n\nB. Communication or Conduct “on the Basis of Sex”\n\n        To establish the second element of his hostile work environment claim, Kalich\nneeded to show that “but for the fact of [his] sex, [he] would not have been the object of\nharassment.” Id. (emphasis added) (quoting Radtke, 501 N.W.2d at 163). This element\nis derived from the language in section 37.2202(1)(a) of ELCRA which prohibits\ndiscrimination “because of . . . sex.” Id. at 308. Stated differently, a plaintiff must show\nthat the harassment was gender-based. See Barbour v. Dep’t of Soc. Servs., 497 N.W.2d\n216, 218 (Mich. Ct. App. 1993) (per curiam). A plaintiff can make this showing with\nevidence that “members of one sex are exposed to disadvantageous terms or conditions\nof employment to which members of the other sex are not exposed.” Vickers v. Fairfield\nMed. Ctr., 453 F.3d 757, 765 (6th Cir. 2006) (quoting Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore\nServs., Inc., 523 U.S. 75, 80 (1998)). Harassment or discrimination because of a\nperson’s sexual orientation or perceived sexual orientation is not prohibited conduct\nunder ELCRA. Barbour, 497 N.W.2d at 217-18.\n\n        In Vickers, we evaluated a male plaintiff’s claim of same-gender sexual\nharassment utilizing the Supreme Court’s approach in Oncale.1 We identified three\nways a male plaintiff could establish the “because of sex” element of a hostile work\nenvironment claim based on same-gender sexual harassment: (1) by showing that the\n\n\n\n        1\n          Although Vickers was a case that arose under Title VII, Michigan courts afford substantial\nconsideration to federal precedent when interpreting analogous provisions of ELCRA. See Chambers, 614\nN.W.2d at 917; Radtke v. Everett, 471 N.W.2d at 663; Barrett v. Kirtland Cmty. Coll., 628 N.W.2d 63,\n69-70 (Mich. Ct. App. 2001).\n\fNo. 10-2554        Kalich v. AT&T                                                 Page 7\n\n\nharasser making sexual advances acted out of a sexual desire; (2) by showing that the\nharasser was motivated by general hostility to the presence of men in the workplace; or\n(3) by offering “direct comparative evidence about how the alleged harasser treated\nmembers of both sexes in a mixed-sex workplace.” Vickers, 453 F.3d at 765 (quoting\nOncale, 523 U.S. at 80-81).\n\n       The district court properly concluded that Kalich failed to establish that Rich’s\nconduct towards him was “because of” his gender. In his deposition, Kalich admitted\nthat Rich made no apparent sexual advances toward him, nor indicated any sexual\ninterest in him. Kalich did not present any evidence that Rich had a general hostility to\nmen in the workplace, and Kalich did not offer comparative evidence that Rich generally\ntreated women in the workplace more favorably than men. In fact, Kalich stated in his\ndeposition that Rich was rude, aggressive and generally unapproachable towards all\nemployees. Kalich even recounted a specific instance in which one of his colleagues—a\nfemale manager at another store location—called Kalich in tears after a meeting in which\nRich “yelled and screamed” at her.\n\n       By all accounts, Kalich established that Rich created very unpleasant working\nconditions for the employees that were in Rich’s chain-of-command. While Kalich\nseemed to be the primary target of Rich’s campaign of teasing and name-calling, there\nis no evidence that Rich singled Kalich out “because of” his gender. In fact, Kalich\nacknowledged in his deposition that he believed Rich made the derogatory comments\nbecause he knew or suspected that Kalich was gay. Under Michigan law, as under Title\nVII, sexual orientation is not a protected classification. Barbour, 497 N.W.2d at 217-18.\nThus, harassment or discrimination based upon a person’s sexual orientation cannot form\nthe basis of a cognizable claim. Id. Moreover, teasing and name-calling, while\ninappropriate in a professional environment, are insufficient to state a claim for sexual\nharassment. See Schemansky v. California Pizza Kitchen, Inc., 122 F. Supp. 2d 761,\n775-76 (E.D. Mich. 2000); Quinto v. Cross and Peters Co., 547 N.W.2d 314, 320-21\n(Mich. 1996) (noting that conduct that is demeaning or humiliating but that does not\nevidence hostility towards a protected class is not actionable under ELCRA).\n\fNo. 10-2554        Kalich v. AT&T                                                    Page 8\n\n\n       In sum, the district court properly concluded that Kalich did not present sufficient\nevidence on this element of his claim to withstand summary judgment.\n\nC. Unwelcome Sexual Conduct or Communication\n\n       In addition to the requirement that he was singled out because of his gender,\nKalich was also required to present evidence that he was “subjected to unwelcome\nsexual conduct or communication.” Haynie, 664 N.W.2d at 133. This element is\nderived from the language in § 37.2103(i) of ELCRA, which states that “[s]exual\nharassment means unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other\nverbal or physical conduct or communication of a sexual nature. . . .” Id. The Michigan\nSupreme Court has held that “actionable sexual harassment requires conduct or\ncommunication that inherently pertains to sex.” Corley v. Detroit Bd. of Educ., 681\nN.W.2d 342, 345 (Mich. 2004) (defining “sexual nature”); see also Haynie, 664 N.W.2d\nat 135-36; Barrett, 628 N.W.2d at 74-75. Discriminatory conduct that is gender-based\nbut not sexual in nature does not constitute sexual harassment. Haynie, 664 N.W.2d at\n135.\n\n       In his brief, Kalich argues:\n\n       David Rich’s conduct towards Plaintiff was of an “inherently” sexual\n       nature because: (1) Rich’s admitted comments to and about Plaintiff that\n       he was a necrophiliac are by definition of a sexual nature, (2) Rich’s\n       repeated remarks to Plaintiff that related to his gender and implied that\n       he was a homosexual when Plaintiff never discussed his sexual\n       orientation with Rich inherently relate to sex because they were intended\n       to “bring him out of the closet,” and (3) Rich made some of his offensive\n       remarks to Plaintiff in such a manner that manifested his sexual desire for\n       Plaintiff.\n\nPutting aside the necrophiliac comment, which is discussed below, Kalich contends that\ncomments designed to “bring him out of the closet” as a homosexual man inherently\nrelate to sex. Kalich cites Barbour for the proposition that such comments “state[] a\nclaim for same gender [sic] hostile work environment sexual harassment because such\nconduct directly relates to gender.”\n\fNo. 10-2554           Kalich v. AT&T                                                          Page 9\n\n\n        Kalich’s reading of Barbour is simply wrong. Barbour filed a complaint\npursuant to ELCRA, alleging that throughout his employment with the defendant he was\nthe victim of sexual harassment by co-workers and supervisors. 497 N.W.2d at 217.\nBarbour claimed he was subjected to various forms of verbal and nonverbal harassment\nin efforts to get him to “come out of the closet . . . and to engage in homosexual sex.”\nId. There was no dispute that Barbour’s sexual orientation constituted the subject matter\nof the harassment. Id. The trial court concluded that harassment or discrimination based\nupon a person’s sexual orientation was not conduct prohibited by ELCRA and granted\nsummary disposition in favor of the defendant. Id. at 218. The Michigan Court of\nAppeals affirmed this portion of the trial court’s judgment. Id.\n\n        However, the court of appeals found that the trial court erred in dismissing\nanother portion of Barbour’s complaint “insofar as it alleged specific homosexual\nadvances directed to him by his supervisor.” Id. (emphasis added). The court found that\n“these actions were directly related to plaintiff’s status as a male, and thus render[ed] the\nact applicable.” Id. Therefore, Barbour is better understood as standing for the\nproposition that, regardless of the target’s sexual orientation, a supervisor’s unwanted\nsexual advance is conduct that could state a claim for hostile work environment sexual\nharassment.2 After all, it is conduct that is directed at a particular person “because of”\nthat person’s gender (i.e., the gender to which the harasser is attracted), and it is conduct\nthat is inherently sexual in nature. Therefore, the part of Barbour’s complaint that stated\na cognizable claim was based not on Barbour’s status as a homosexual or on the\nharasser’s motivation to “bring him out of the closet,” but rather on the fact that Barbour\nwas subjected to unwanted sexual advances, conduct which was unquestionably “sexual\nin nature” and “because of” Barbour’s gender.\n\n        Kalich has not alleged that Rich made any sexual advances towards him. He\npresented no evidence that Rich’s teasing was borne out of a sexual desire for Kalich or\neven that Rich himself is homosexual. Although Kalich argues in his brief that the\n\n\n        2\n           Of course, the conduct would still have to be either pervasive enough or of such an extreme\nnature as to satisfy the fourth element of a “hostile environment” claim.\n\fNo. 10-2554        Kalich v. AT&T                                                Page 10\n\n\ncomments referring to him as a girl “demonstrate[] Rich’s sexual desire for him,” he\nbases this conclusion on the fact that “Rich made these comments while pointing and\nstaring at [Kalich’s] behind.” According to Kalich, “It is not a leap to believe that Rich\nwas sexually attracted to [him] because [Rich] was staring at [his] behind while\ncommenting about his physique.” While this argument boasts a certain logic, we must\nbase our decision on evidence, and the evidence of record does not support the\nconclusion Kalich urges. In Kalich’s deposition, counsel for AT&T pointedly asked\nhim, “Did Rich ever indicate that he had a sexual interest in you?” Kalich’s response\nwas an unequivocal “no.” Kalich’s contention on appeal that a certain remark “could\narguably manifest Rich’s sexual desire for [him],” is thus belied by his prior testimony\nto the contrary. In any event, the standard is not whether certain conduct or comments\ncould “arguably manifest” sexual desire, but whether the conduct or comments\n“inherently pertain to sex.” Rich’s comments do not meet that standard.\n\n       Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Kalich, the vast majority of\nthe comments Kalich cited in his complaint cannot be construed as sexual in nature.\nRich’s remarks about Kalich’s glasses, or referring to Kalich by various female names,\nor about his “cute” dog do not inherently pertain to sex, nor do Rich’s remarks about the\nfit of Kalich’s clothes, his sewing abilities, or that he was “wasting away” and “looked\nlike a girl.” The district court acknowledged that Rich’s comment referring to Kalich\nas a necrophiliac, however, was sexual in nature. Nevertheless, Kalich presented no\nevidence that Rich directed this comment at him “because of” his gender. Without\nevidence of some gender-based animus, the mere fact that Rich made a comment to\nKalich that was sexual in nature cannot form the basis of a cognizable claim. See\nOncale, 523 U.S. at 80 (“We have never held that workplace harassment . . . is\nautomatically discrimination because of sex merely because the words used have sexual\ncontent or connotations. The critical issue . . . is whether members of one sex are\nexposed to disadvantageous terms or conditions of employment to which members of the\nother sex are not exposed.”) (internal citations omitted).\n\fNo. 10-2554        Kalich v. AT&T                                                Page 11\n\n\nD. Intimidating, Hostile or Offensive Work Environment\n\n       Another essential component of a hostile work environment claim requires the\nplaintiff to show that the unwelcome sexual conduct or communications were intended\nto or did in fact substantially interfere with the plaintiff’s employment or created an\nintimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment. Haynie, 664 N.W.2d at 133. “The\nessence of a hostile work environment action is that one or more supervisors or co-\nworkers create an atmosphere so infused with hostility toward members of one sex that\nthey alter the conditions of employment for them.” Radtke, 501 N.W.2d at 163 (citations\nomitted). The existence of a hostile work environment “shall be determined by whether\na reasonable person, in the totality of the circumstances, would have perceived the\nconduct at issue as substantially interfering with the plaintiff’s employment or having\nthe purpose or effect of creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work\nenvironment.” Id. at 167. Factors relevant to the inquiry include: the frequency of the\ndiscriminatory conduct; the conduct’s severity; whether the conduct was physically\nthreatening or humiliating or merely an offensive utterance; and whether the conduct\nunreasonably interfered with the employee’s work performance. See Quinto, 547\nN.W.2d at 320 (quoting Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 23 (1993)). Except in\nthe case of extreme incidents such as rape or sexual assault, a single, isolated event is\ntypically insufficient to create a hostile work environment. See Radtke, 501 N.W.2d at\n168 & n.40.\n\n       The single necrophilia comment that Rich directed at Kalich, the only comment\nKalich cites that could conceivably constitute sexual harassment, is not the sort of\n“extremely traumatic experience” that Michigan courts recognize as creating a hostile\nwork environment based on a single occurrence. Under the applicable standard, a\nreasonable person would not perceive this single remark as being so severe and extreme\nas to create an objectively hostile work environment. The remainder of Rich’s remarks,\nthough unprofessional and perhaps subjectively hurtful, embarassing, or offensive to\nKalich, are not actionable under ELCRA because, as discussed above, they are not\n\fNo. 10-2554        Kalich v. AT&T                                                Page 12\n\n\ninherently sexual in nature.    Therefore, the record before the district court was\ninsufficient to withstand summary judgment on this element of Kalich’s claim as well.\n\nE. Respondeat Superior\n\n       The final element of the prima facie case for hostile work environment sexual\nharassment requires the plaintiff to establish that the employer had either actual or\nconstructive notice of the hostile work environment and failed to take prompt and\nadequate remedial action. Betts v. Costco Wholesale Corp., 558 F.3d 461, 470-71 (6th\nCir. 2009) (citing Sheridan v. Forest Hills Pub. Schs., 637 N.W.2d 536, 542 (Mich. Ct.\nApp. 2001)). “[A]n employer can be vicariously liable for a hostile work environment\nonly if it ‘failed to take prompt and adequate remedial action upon reasonable notice of\nthe creation of a hostile work environment.’” Elezovic v. Ford Motor Co., 697 N.W.2d\n851, 863 (Mich. 2005) (emphasis added) (quoting Chambers, 614 N.W.2d at 918). To\nestablish actual notice, a plaintiff must show that he reported the harassment to someone\nin “higher management”—that is, to “someone in the employer’s chain of command who\npossesses the ability to exercise significant influence in the decision-making process of\nhiring, firing, and disciplining the offensive employee.” Sheridan, 637 N.W.2d at\n542–43. A plaintiff can establish constructive notice by showing that the harassment\nwas so pervasive as to warrant an inference that the employer had actual knowledge or\nto charge the employer with constructive knowledge. Sheridan, 637 N.W.2d at 542.\nWhen determining the adequacy of the employer’s remedial action, the proper inquiry\nis “whether the action reasonably served to prevent future harassment of the plaintiff.”\nChambers, 614 N.W.2d at 919.\n\n       AT&T did not have actual notice of Kalich’s complaint until sometime on or\nafter March 19, 2009, the date that Kalich’s attorney drafted the letter to Gaffga. On\nMarch 27, 2009, Marybeth Dunne, a Senior EEO Consultant with AT&T, was assigned\nto conduct the investigation into Kalich’s complaint. Dunne instructed Rich not to visit\n\fNo. 10-2554            Kalich v. AT&T                                                            Page 13\n\n\nKalich’s store during the pendency of the investigation, and Rich complied.3 In the\ncourse of her investigation, Dunne interviewed Kalich, Rich, and the other employees\nof the Clarkston store. During an interview, Dunne specifically asked Kalich what type\nof resolution he was seeking, to which Kalich responded, “I don’t know.” Dunne\ncompleted her investigation on April 7, 2009 and concluded that Rich had made\n“inappropriate comments” to Kalich. Dunne recommended that AT&T issue Rich a\ndisciplinary warning, require Rich to attend special training, and remove Rich from\nKalich’s chain-of-command, all of which AT&T did. On April 9, 2009, AT&T informed\nKalich that Susan Suppley would be his new supervisor. Four days later, Kalich notified\nGaffga of his resignation.\n\n         Based on the record, Kalich presented no evidence that AT&T failed to\nadequately rectify the problem upon receiving notice. Kalich’s brief emphasizes that\nAT&T did not formalize Rich’s transfer or issue the final disciplinary warning until\nnearly one month after his letter of complaint, but it is clear that an investigation began\nwithin a week of Kalich’s letter and concluded only ten business days later. Performing\nan adequate investigation, which in this case included an interview of every employee\nat the Clarkston store, takes time. Moreover, upon the initiation of the investigation,\nAT&T instructed Rich to have no further contact with Kalich, and ultimately, AT&T\npermanently reassigned Rich to a different region. This resolution certainly was\ndesigned to prevent future harassment of Kalich. Thus, under the applicable standard,\nAT&T took adequate remedial measures and there is no basis upon which to impose\nrespondeat superior liability. See Chambers, 614 N.W.2d at 919.\n\n                                       III. CONCLUSION\n\n         Because Kalich has failed to produce sufficient evidence to establish each\nelement of his claim, we AFFIRM the district court’s summary disposition in favor of\nAT&T.\n\n\n         3\n          Rich made the necrophilia comment to Kalich during the one-week interim between the time\nKalich’s attorney drafted the letter and the time AT&T launched its formal investigation. At the time, Rich\nwas unaware of Kalich’s complaint.\n\f",

Tuyn, Ogletree, Deakins, Nash, Smoak &amp; Stewart, PLLC, Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, for Appellee.</p>\n<p>Before: GIBBONS, GRIFFIN, and DONALD, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>OPINION</h2>\n<p>BERNICE BOUIE DONALD, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>Plaintiff-Appellant Jeffrey Kalich filed a complaint against his former employer, Defendant-Appellee AT &amp; T Mobility, LLC, (\"AT &amp; T\"), in state court pursuant to Michigan's Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act (\"ELCRA\"). Kalich alleged that his immediate supervisor David Rich created a hostile work environment by subjecting Kalich to comments that constituted sexual harassment. AT &amp; T removed the action to federal court. On November 2, 2010, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*468</span> the district court granted AT &amp; T's motion for summary judgment, finding that Kalich's claims were not actionable under the sexual harassment hostile work environment provisions of ELCRA. Kalich appealed. For the reasons stated herein, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>On May 19, 2008, AT &amp; T hired Kalich as a retail store manager in Clarkston, Michigan. Rich, AT &amp; T's area sales manager, was Kalich's immediate supervisor. Rich visited Kalich's store approximately ten times per month. During the course of Kalich's employment, Rich made various comments to Kalich that Kalich found upsetting and offensive. These comments are summarized chronologically as follows:</p>\n<p>On June 12, 2008, Rich said to Kalich, \"Oh I like your glasses. You should change your name to Virginia or Margaret. No. I like Virginia the best.\" Throughout the rest of that day, Rich continued to refer to Kalich as Virginia, Margaret, and Peggy in front of other staff members.</p>\n<p>On August 7, 2008, Rich made remarks about Kalich's dog, a Yorkshire terrier. Rich asked Kalich, \"What kind of dog is that? Oh, how cute. It figures.\" Rich later said, \"That's the perfect dog for you. What's his name? Fluffy, Oliver? Okay. Tell OscarI mean Oliver or Fluffy or whatever hello.\" Thereafter, Rich regularly referred to Kalich's dog by the names of Fluffy or Princess.</p>\n<p>On December 11, 2008, Rich said to Kalich, \"What? Do you not eat? You are wasting away. Your pants don't even fit you right anymore. You look like a girl.\" Kalich alleges Rich made these remarks while laughing, staring at Kalich's behind, and staring and pointing at Kalich's pants.</p>\n<p>On February 13, 2009, Rich asked Kalich whether the human rights sticker on his vehicle was a \"Swedish flag.\" Rich asked, \"What kind of flag is that on your car, a Swedish one?\" Despite Kalich's explanation that the sticker was a symbol of equal rights, Rich persisted in referring to it as a \"Swedish flag.\"</p>\n<p>On February 23, 2009, Rich told Kalich he should change his name to Peggy, Margaret, Mary Ann, or Susan. Rich then said, \"No. I still like Virginia. Or how about Kristine, like your mom?\" Rich made these comments in front of Kalich's employees.</p>\n<p>On March 16, 2009, Rich said to Kalich, \"You should sew Kristine a quilt. Come on, Virginia. You know you can sew. Dear, you know you can do it.\"</p>\n<p>According to Kalich, Rich repeatedly and regularly made comments like those detailed above, but Kalich was only able to make notes of the comments on isolated occasions.</p>\n<p>AT &amp; T has a Code of Business Conduct that forbids unlawful harassment of any kind, including sexual harassment. The Code provides internal procedures by which employees can report violations. Rather than pursue these internal options, Kalich retained an attorney in March 2009. Kalich's attorney sent a letter to Ken Gaffga, Rich's supervisor, on March 19, 2009. The letter described Rich's comments and conduct towards Kalich and demanded that the conduct cease immediately. The letter further asked that Kalich \"be placed in a work environment free of gender based [sic] harassment\" and that \"labor relations and/or AT &amp; T's counsel contact me forthwith\" regarding resolution of Kalich's complaints.</p>\n<p>On March 25, 2009, Rich allegedly called Kalich a necrophiliac, laughed, and stated in the presence of Kalich's employees that Kalich had sex with dead people. Although Kalich had no further contact with <span class=\"star-pagination\">*469</span> Rich after this incident, Rich allegedly made similar comments the following day in the presence of several of Kalich's co-workers. Rich later stated that he confused \"narcolepsy,\" a condition from which Kalich apparently suffers, with necrophilia, and that this confusion led him to make a comment about Kalich being a necrophiliac. At the time he made the necrophilia comment, Rich was not yet aware of the letter that Kalich's attorney sent to Gaffga complaining of Rich's comments.</p>\n<p>Sometime during the first week of April, Kalich requested a thirty-day leave of absence. Gaffga denied Kalich's request, but authorized Kalich to take six days off. Also in the beginning of April 2009, AT &amp; T's equal employment opportunity (\"EEO\") department began an investigation in response to Kalich's complaint. On April 9, 2009, Gaffga informed Kalich that Rich would be transferred and would no longer oversee operations at Kalich's store. In addition, Rich was given a final written warning for his inappropriate comments and would be required to take classes focused on promoting a professional work environment.</p>\n<p>On April 13, 2009, while on his leave of absence, Kalich notified AT &amp; T of his resignation. Kalich explained that the dynamics of the work environment had changed as a result of the EEO investigation, which included interviews with all of the store employees. In addition, Kalich feared that, despite being re-assigned to the supervision of Susan Suppley, he might nevertheless encounter Rich on occasion. Kalich was uncomfortable with the prospect of future encounters with Rich and, therefore, \"for mental and physical health reasons . . . felt it in [his] best interest to resign.\" Kalich's last day of employment with AT &amp; T was April 29, 2009.</p>\n<p>Kalich contends that Rich's conduct amounted to sexual harassment that created a hostile work environment. In his complaint, Kalich sought to impose liability on AT &amp; T for Rich's conduct pursuant to ELCRA, Michigan's civil rights statute. After the close of discovery, the district court granted AT &amp; T's motion for summary judgment, finding that Kalich had failed to present evidence in support of each element of his claim. Kalich timely appealed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. ANALYSIS</h2>\n<p>We review a district court's order granting summary judgment <i>de novo. </i><i>Int'l Union v. Cummins, Inc.,</i> 434 F.3d 478, 483 (6th Cir.2006). Summary judgment is proper \"if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). After adequate time for discovery and upon motion, summary judgment is proper against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party's case, and upon which that party bears the burden of proof at trial. <i>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett,</i> 477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986).</p>\n<p>ELCRA prohibits employers from discriminating against employees based on sex, which includes sexual harassment. <i>See</i> Mich. Comp. Laws § 37.2102; <i>Chambers v. Trettco, Inc.,</i> 463 Mich. 297, 614 N.W.2d 910, 915 (2000). Michigan law defines \"sexual harassment\" as \"unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct or communication of a sexual nature\" under circumstances where submission to the conduct or communication is made a \"quid pro quo\" of gaining or keeping employment or where the conduct or communication \"has the purpose or effect of substantially interfering with an individual's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*470</span> employment. . . .\" Mich. Comp. Laws § 37.2103(i).</p>\n<p>Sexual harassment that substantially interferes with an individual's employment is referred to as \"hostile work environment\" harassment. <i>Radtke v. Everett,</i> 442 Mich. 368, 501 N.W.2d 155, 161 (1993). Kalich does not allege that Rich conditioned his continued employment upon submission to any sexual advances or overtures. Rather, Kalich alleges that Rich's conduct created a hostile work environment. To establish a <i>prima facie</i> case of hostile work environment based on sexual harassment, Kalich was required to present evidence that: (1) he belonged to a protected group; (2) he was subjected to communication or conduct on the basis of sex; (3) he was subjected to unwelcome sexual conduct or communication; (4) the unwelcome conduct or communication was intended to or did substantially interfere with the plaintiff's employment or created an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment; and (5) respondeat superior. <i>Haynie v. State,</i> 468 Mich. 302, 664 N.W.2d 129, 133 (2003); <i>Chambers,</i> 614 N.W.2d at 915.</p>\n<p>In granting AT &amp; T's motion, the district court found that there was no dispute of material fact and that Kalich failed to present sufficient evidence on each element of his claim to withstand summary judgment. The court described Rich's conduct as \"crude, bullying, [and] despicable\" but found that it was \"not actionable under the sexual harassment hostile work environment provisions of ELCRA.\" We agree.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Protected Group</h2>\n<p>As to the first element of a hostile work environment sexual harassment claim, Kalich met his burden. The Michigan Supreme Court has held that \"all employees are inherently members of a protected class in hostile work environment cases because all persons may be discriminated against on the basis of sex.\" <i>Haynie,</i> 664 N.W.2d at 133 (quoting <i>Radtke,</i> 501 N.W.2d at 162). Accordingly, Kalich presented sufficient evidence of the first element of his <i>prima facie</i> case.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Communication or Conduct \"on the Basis of Sex\"</h2>\n<p>To establish the second element of his hostile work environment claim, Kalich needed to show that \"<i>but for</i> the fact of [his] sex, [he] would not have been the object of harassment.\" <i>Id.</i> (emphasis added) (quoting <i>Radtke,</i> 501 N.W.2d at 163). This element is derived from the language in section 37.2202(1)(a) of ELCRA which prohibits discrimination \"because of . . . sex.\" <i>Id.</i> at 308, 664 N.W.2d 129. Stated differently, a plaintiff must show that the harassment was gender-based. <i>See </i><i>Barbour v. Dep't of Soc. Servs.,</i> 198 Mich.App. 183, 497 N.W.2d 216, 218 (1993) (per curiam). A plaintiff can make this showing with evidence that \"members of one sex are exposed to disadvantageous terms or conditions of employment to which members of the other sex are not exposed.\" <i>Vickers v. Fairfield Med. Ctr.,</i> 453 F.3d 757, 765 (6th Cir.2006) (quoting <i>Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Servs., Inc.,</i> 523 U.S. 75, 80, 118 S.Ct. 998, 140 L.Ed.2d 201 (1998)). Harassment or discrimination because of a person's sexual orientation or perceived sexual orientation is not prohibited conduct under ELCRA. <i>Barbour,</i> 497 N.W.2d at 217-18.</p>\n<p>In <i>Vickers,</i> we evaluated a male plaintiff's claim of same-gender sexual harassment utilizing the Supreme Court's approach in <i>Oncale.</i><sup>[1]</sup> We identified three <span class=\"star-pagination\">*471</span> ways a male plaintiff could establish the \"because of sex\" element of a hostile work environment claim based on same-gender sexual harassment: (1) by showing that the harasser making sexual advances acted out of a sexual desire; (2) by showing that the harasser was motivated by general hostility to the presence of men in the workplace; or (3) by offering \"direct comparative evidence about how the alleged harasser treated members of both sexes in a mixed-sex workplace.\" <i>Vickers,</i> 453 F.3d at 765 (quoting <i>Oncale,</i> 523 U.S. at 80-81, 118 S.Ct. 998).</p>\n<p>The district court properly concluded that Kalich failed to establish that Rich's conduct towards him was \"because of\" his gender. In his deposition, Kalich admitted that Rich made no apparent sexual advances toward him, nor indicated any sexual interest in him. Kalich did not present any evidence that Rich had a general hostility to men in the workplace, and Kalich did not offer comparative evidence that Rich generally treated women in the workplace more favorably than men. In fact, Kalich stated in his deposition that Rich was rude, aggressive and generally unapproachable towards <i>all employees.</i> Kalich even recounted a specific instance in which one of his colleaguesa female manager at another store locationcalled Kalich in tears after a meeting in which Rich \"yelled and screamed\" at her.</p>\n<p>By all accounts, Kalich established that Rich created very unpleasant working conditions for the employees that were in Rich's chain-of-command. While Kalich seemed to be the primary target of Rich's campaign of teasing and name-calling, there is no evidence that Rich singled Kalich out \"because of\" his gender. In fact, Kalich acknowledged in his deposition that he believed Rich made the derogatory comments because he knew or suspected that Kalich was gay. Under Michigan law, as under Title VII, sexual orientation is not a protected classification. <i>Barbour,</i> 497 N.W.2d at 217-18. Thus, harassment or discrimination based upon a person's sexual orientation cannot form the basis of a cognizable claim. <i>Id.</i> Moreover, teasing and name-calling, while inappropriate in a professional environment, are insufficient to state a claim for sexual harassment. <i>See </i><i>Schemansky v. California Pizza Kitchen, Inc.,</i> 122 F.Supp.2d 761, 775-76 (E.D.Mich.2000); <i>Quinto v. Cross and Peters Co.,</i> 451 Mich. 358, 547 N.W.2d 314, 320-21 (1996) (noting that conduct that is demeaning or humiliating but that does not evidence hostility towards a protected class is not actionable under ELCRA).</p>\n<p>In sum, the district court properly concluded that Kalich did not present sufficient evidence on this element of his claim to withstand summary judgment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. Unwelcome Sexual Conduct or Communication</h2>\n<p>In addition to the requirement that he was singled out because of his gender, Kalich was also required to present evidence that he was \"subjected to unwelcome sexual conduct or communication.\" <i>Haynie,</i> 664 N.W.2d at 133. This element is derived from the language in § 37.2103(i) of ELCRA, which states that \"[s]exual harassment means unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct or communication of a sexual nature. . . .\" <i>Id.</i> The Michigan Supreme Court has held that \"actionable sexual harassment requires conduct or communication that <i>inherently</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*472</span> pertains to sex.\" <i>Corley v. Detroit Bd. of Educ.,</i> 470 Mich. 274, 681 N.W.2d 342, 345 (2004) (defining \"sexual nature\"); <i>see also </i><i>Haynie,</i> 664 N.W.2d at 135-36; <i>Barrett,</i> 628 N.W.2d at 74-75. Discriminatory conduct that is gender-based but not sexual in nature does not constitute sexual harassment. <i>Haynie,</i> 664 N.W.2d at 135.</p>\n<p>In his brief, Kalich argues:</p>\n<blockquote>David Rich's conduct towards Plaintiff was of an \"inherently\" sexual nature because: (1) Rich's admitted comments to and about Plaintiff that he was a necrophiliac are by definition of a sexual nature, (2) Rich's repeated remarks to Plaintiff that related to his gender and implied that he was a homosexual when Plaintiff never discussed his sexual orientation with Rich inherently relate to sex because they were intended to \"bring him out of the closet,\" and (3) Rich made some of his offensive remarks to Plaintiff in such a manner that manifested his sexual desire for Plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<p>Putting aside the necrophiliac comment, which is discussed below, Kalich contends that comments designed to \"bring him out of the closet\" as a homosexual man inherently relate to sex. Kalich cites <i>Barbour</i> for the proposition that such comments \"state[ ] a claim for same gender [sic] hostile work environment sexual harassment because such conduct directly relates to gender.\"</p>\n<p>Kalich's reading of <i>Barbour</i> is simply wrong. Barbour filed a complaint pursuant to ELCRA, alleging that throughout his employment with the defendant he was the victim of sexual harassment by co-workers and supervisors. 497 N.W.2d at 217. Barbour claimed he was subjected to various forms of verbal and nonverbal harassment in efforts to get him to \"come out of the closet . . . and to engage in homosexual sex.\" <i>Id.</i> There was no dispute that Barbour's sexual orientation constituted the subject matter of the harassment. <i>Id.</i> The trial court concluded that harassment or discrimination based upon a person's sexual orientation was not conduct prohibited by ELCRA and granted summary disposition in favor of the defendant. <i>Id.</i> at 218. The Michigan Court of Appeals affirmed this portion of the trial court's judgment. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>However, the court of appeals found that the trial court erred in dismissing another portion of Barbour's complaint \"insofar as it alleged <i>specific homosexual advances directed to him by his supervisor.</i>\" <i>Id.</i> (emphasis added). The court found that \"these actions were directly related to plaintiff's status as a male, and thus render[ed] the act applicable.\" <i>Id.</i> Therefore, <i>Barbour</i> is better understood as standing for the proposition that, regardless of the target's sexual orientation, a supervisor's unwanted sexual advance is conduct that <i>could</i> state a claim for hostile work environment sexual harassment.<sup>[2]</sup> After all, it is conduct that is directed at a particular person \"because of\" that person's gender (i.e., the gender to which the harasser is attracted), <i>and</i> it is conduct that is inherently sexual in nature. Therefore, the part of Barbour's complaint that stated a cognizable claim was based not on Barbour's status as a homosexual or on the harasser's motivation to \"bring him out of the closet,\" but rather on the fact that Barbour was subjected to unwanted sexual advances, conduct which was unquestionably \"sexual in nature\" and \"because of\" Barbour's gender.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*473</span> Kalich has not alleged that Rich made any sexual advances towards him. He presented no evidence that Rich's teasing was borne out of a sexual desire for Kalich or even that Rich himself is homosexual. Although Kalich argues in his brief that the comments referring to him as a girl \"demonstrate[ ] Rich's sexual desire for him,\" he bases this conclusion on the fact that \"Rich made these comments while pointing and staring at [Kalich's] behind.\" According to Kalich, \"It is not a leap to believe that Rich was sexually attracted to [him] because [Rich] was staring at [his] behind while commenting about his physique.\" While this argument boasts a certain logic, we must base our decision on evidence, and the evidence of record does not support the conclusion Kalich urges. In Kalich's deposition, counsel for AT &amp; T pointedly asked him, \"Did Rich ever indicate that he had a sexual interest in you?\" Kalich's response was an unequivocal \"no.\" Kalich's contention on appeal that a certain remark \"could arguably manifest Rich's sexual desire for [him],\" is thus belied by his prior testimony to the contrary. In any event, the standard is not whether certain conduct or comments could \"arguably manifest\" sexual desire, but whether the conduct or comments \"<i>inherently pertain</i> to sex.\" Rich's comments do not meet that standard.</p>\n<p>Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Kalich, the vast majority of the comments Kalich cited in his complaint cannot be construed as sexual in nature. Rich's remarks about Kalich's glasses, or referring to Kalich by various female names, or about his \"cute\" dog do not inherently pertain to sex, nor do Rich's remarks about the fit of Kalich's clothes, his sewing abilities, or that he was \"wasting away\" and \"looked like a girl.\" The district court acknowledged that Rich's comment referring to Kalich as a necrophiliac, however, was sexual in nature. Nevertheless, Kalich presented no evidence that Rich directed this comment at him \"because of\" his gender. Without evidence of some gender-based animus, the mere fact that Rich made a comment to Kalich that was sexual in nature cannot form the basis of a cognizable claim. <i>See </i><i>Oncale,</i> 523 U.S. at 80, 118 S.Ct. 998 (\"We have never held that workplace harassment. . . is automatically discrimination because of sex merely because the words used have sexual content or connotations. The critical issue . . . is whether members of one sex are exposed to disadvantageous terms or conditions of employment to which members of the other sex are not exposed.\") (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. Intimidating, Hostile or Offensive Work Environment</h2>\n<p>Another essential component of a hostile work environment claim requires the plaintiff to show that the unwelcome sexual conduct or communications were intended to or did in fact substantially interfere with the plaintiff's employment or created an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment. <i>Haynie,</i> 664 N.W.2d at 133. \"The essence of a hostile work environment action is that one or more supervisors or coworkers create an atmosphere so infused with hostility toward members of one sex that they alter the conditions of employment for them.\" <i>Radtke,</i> 501 N.W.2d at 163 (citations omitted). The existence of a hostile work environment \"shall be determined by whether a reasonable person, in the totality of the circumstances, would have perceived the conduct at issue as substantially interfering with the plaintiff's employment or having the purpose or effect of creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment.\" <i>Id.</i> at 167. Factors relevant to the inquiry include: the frequency of the discriminatory conduct; the conduct's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*474</span> severity; whether the conduct was physically threatening or humiliating or merely an offensive utterance; and whether the conduct unreasonably interfered with the employee's work performance. <i>See </i><i>Quinto,</i> 547 N.W.2d at 320 (quoting <i>Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc.,</i> 510 U.S. 17, 23, 114 S.Ct. 367, 126 L.Ed.2d 295 (1993)). Except in the case of extreme incidents such as rape or sexual assault, a single, isolated event is typically insufficient to create a hostile work environment. <i>See </i><i>Radtke,</i> 501 N.W.2d at 168 &amp; n. 40.</p>\n<p>The single necrophilia comment that Rich directed at Kalich, the only comment Kalich cites that could conceivably constitute sexual harassment, is not the sort of \"extremely traumatic experience\" that Michigan courts recognize as creating a hostile work environment based on a single occurrence. Under the applicable standard, a reasonable person would not perceive this single remark as being so severe and extreme as to create an objectively hostile work environment. The remainder of Rich's remarks, though unprofessional and perhaps subjectively hurtful, embarrassing, or offensive to Kalich, are not actionable under ELCRA because, as discussed above, they are not inherently sexual in nature. Therefore, the record before the district court was insufficient to withstand summary judgment on this element of Kalich's claim as well.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>E. Respondeat Superior</h2>\n<p>The final element of the <i>prima facie</i> case for hostile work environment sexual harassment requires the plaintiff to establish that the employer had either actual or constructive notice of the hostile work environment and failed to take prompt and adequate remedial action. <i>Betts v. Costco Wholesale Corp.,</i> 558 F.3d 461, 470-71 (6th Cir.2009) (citing <i>Sheridan v. Forest Hills Pub. Schs.,</i> 247 Mich.App. 611, 637 N.W.2d 536, 542 (2001)). \"[A]n employer can be vicariously liable for a hostile work environment <i>only if</i> it `failed to take prompt and adequate remedial action upon reasonable notice of the creation of a hostile work environment.'\" <i>Elezovic v. Ford Motor Co.,</i> 472 Mich. 408, 697 N.W.2d 851, 863 (2005) (emphasis added) (quoting <i>Chambers,</i> 614 N.W.2d at 918). To establish actual notice, a plaintiff must show that he reported the harassment to someone in \"higher management\"that is, to \"someone in the employer's chain of command who possesses the ability to exercise significant influence in the decision-making process of hiring, firing, and disciplining the offensive employee.\" <i>Sheridan,</i> 637 N.W.2d at 542-43. A plaintiff can establish constructive notice by showing that the harassment was so pervasive as to warrant an inference that the employer had actual knowledge or to charge the employer with constructive knowledge. <i>Sheridan,</i> 637 N.W.2d at 542. When determining the adequacy of the employer's remedial action, the proper inquiry is \"whether the action reasonably served to prevent future harassment of the plaintiff.\" <i>Chambers,</i> 614 N.W.2d at 919.</p>\n<p>AT &amp; T did not have actual notice of Kalich's complaint until sometime on or after March 19, 2009, the date that Kalich's attorney drafted the letter to Gaffga. On March 27, 2009, Marybeth Dunne, a Senior EEO Consultant with AT &amp; T, was assigned to conduct the investigation into Kalich's complaint. Dunne instructed Rich not to visit Kalich's store during the pendency of the investigation, and Rich complied.<sup>[3]</sup> In the course of her investigation, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*475</span> Dunne interviewed Kalich, Rich, and the other employees of the Clarkston store. During an interview, Dunne specifically asked Kalich what type of resolution he was seeking, to which Kalich responded, \"I don't know.\" Dunne completed her investigation on April 7, 2009 and concluded that Rich had made \"inappropriate comments\" to Kalich. Dunne recommended that AT &amp; T issue Rich a disciplinary warning, require Rich to attend special training, and remove Rich from Kalich's chain-of-command, all of which AT &amp; T did. On April 9, 2009, AT &amp; T informed Kalich that Susan Suppley would be his new supervisor. Four days later, Kalich notified Gaffga of his resignation.</p>\n<p>Based on the record, Kalich presented no evidence that AT &amp; T failed to adequately rectify the problem upon receiving notice. Kalich's brief emphasizes that AT &amp; T did not formalize Rich's transfer or issue the final disciplinary warning until nearly one month after his letter of complaint, but it is clear that an investigation began within a week of Kalich's letter and concluded only ten business days later. Performing an adequate investigation, which in this case included an interview of every employee at the Clarkston store, takes time. Moreover, upon the initiation of the investigation, AT &amp; T instructed Rich to have no further contact with Kalich, and ultimately, AT &amp; T permanently reassigned Rich to a different region. This resolution certainly was designed to prevent future harassment of Kalich. Thus, under the applicable standard, AT &amp; T took adequate remedial measures and there is no basis upon which to impose respondeat superior liability. <i>See </i><i>Chambers,</i> 614 N.W.2d at 919.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Because Kalich has failed to produce sufficient evidence to establish each element of his claim, we AFFIRM the district court's summary disposition in favor of AT &amp; T.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Although <i>Vickers</i> was a case that arose under Title VII, Michigan courts afford substantial consideration to federal precedent when interpreting analogous provisions of ELCRA. <i>See </i><i>Chambers,</i> 614 N.W.2d at 917; <i>Radtke v. Everett,</i> 471 N.W.2d at 663; <i>Barrett v. Kirtland Cmty. Coll.,</i> 245 Mich.App. 306, 628 N.W.2d 63, 69-70 (2001).</p>\n<p>[2]  Of course, the conduct would still have to be either pervasive enough or of such an extreme nature as to satisfy the fourth element of a \"hostile environment\" claim.</p>\n<p>[3]  Rich made the necrophilia comment to Kalich during the one-week interim between the time Kalich's attorney drafted the letter and the time AT &amp; T launched its formal investigation.

Kalich alleged that his immediate supervisor David Rich created a hostile work environment by subjecting Kalich to comments that constituted sexual harassment. AT &amp; T removed the action to federal court. On November 2, 2010, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*468</span> the district court granted AT &amp; T's motion for summary judgment, finding that Kalich's claims were not actionable under the sexual harassment hostile work environment provisions of ELCRA. Kalich appealed. For the reasons stated herein, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>On May 19, 2008, AT &amp; T hired Kalich as a retail store manager in Clarkston, Michigan. Rich, AT &amp; T's area sales manager, was Kalich's immediate supervisor. Rich visited Kalich's store approximately ten times per month. During the course of Kalich's employment, Rich made various comments to Kalich that Kalich found upsetting and offensive. These comments are summarized chronologically as follows:</p>\n<p>On June 12, 2008, Rich said to Kalich, \"Oh I like your glasses. You should change your name to Virginia or Margaret. No. I like Virginia the best.\" Throughout the rest of that day, Rich continued to refer to Kalich as Virginia, Margaret, and Peggy in front of other staff members.</p>\n<p>On August 7, 2008, Rich made remarks about Kalich's dog, a Yorkshire terrier. Rich asked Kalich, \"What kind of dog is that? Oh, how cute. It figures.\" Rich later said, \"That's the perfect dog for you. What's his name? Fluffy, Oliver? Okay. Tell OscarI mean Oliver or Fluffy or whatever hello.\" Thereafter, Rich regularly referred to Kalich's dog by the names of Fluffy or Princess.</p>\n<p>On December 11, 2008, Rich said to Kalich, \"What? Do you not eat? You are wasting away. Your pants don't even fit you right anymore. You look like a girl.\" Kalich alleges Rich made these remarks while laughing, staring at Kalich's behind, and staring and pointing at Kalich's pants.</p>\n<p>On February 13, 2009, Rich asked Kalich whether the human rights sticker on his vehicle was a \"Swedish flag.\" Rich asked, \"What kind of flag is that on your car, a Swedish one?\" Despite Kalich's explanation that the sticker was a symbol of equal rights, Rich persisted in referring to it as a \"Swedish flag.\"</p>\n<p>On February 23, 2009, Rich told Kalich he should change his name to Peggy, Margaret, Mary Ann, or Susan. Rich then said, \"No. I still like Virginia. Or how about Kristine, like your mom?\" Rich made these comments in front of Kalich's employees.</p>\n<p>On March 16, 2009, Rich said to Kalich, \"You should sew Kristine a quilt. Come on, Virginia. You know you can sew. Dear, you know you can do it.\"</p>\n<p>According to Kalich, Rich repeatedly and regularly made comments like those detailed above, but Kalich was only able to make notes of the comments on isolated occasions.</p>\n<p>AT &amp; T has a Code of Business Conduct that forbids unlawful harassment of any kind, including sexual harassment. The Code provides internal procedures by which employees can report violations. Rather than pursue these internal options, Kalich retained an attorney in March 2009. Kalich's attorney sent a letter to Ken Gaffga, Rich's supervisor, on March 19, 2009. The letter described Rich's comments and conduct towards Kalich and demanded that the conduct cease immediately. The letter further asked that Kalich \"be placed in a work environment free of gender based [sic] harassment\" and that \"labor relations and/or AT &amp; T's counsel contact me forthwith\" regarding resolution of Kalich's complaints.</p>\n<p>On March 25, 2009, Rich allegedly called Kalich a necrophiliac, laughed, and stated in the presence of Kalich's employees that Kalich had sex with dead people. Although Kalich had no further contact with <span class=\"star-pagination\">*469</span> Rich after this incident, Rich allegedly made similar comments the following day in the presence of several of Kalich's co-workers. Rich later stated that he confused \"narcolepsy,\" a condition from which Kalich apparently suffers, with necrophilia, and that this confusion led him to make a comment about Kalich being a necrophiliac. At the time he made the necrophilia comment, Rich was not yet aware of the letter that Kalich's attorney sent to Gaffga complaining of Rich's comments.</p>\n<p>Sometime during the first week of April, Kalich requested a thirty-day leave of absence. Gaffga denied Kalich's request, but authorized Kalich to take six days off. Also in the beginning of April 2009, AT &amp; T's equal employment opportunity (\"EEO\") department began an investigation in response to Kalich's complaint. On April 9, 2009, Gaffga informed Kalich that Rich would be transferred and would no longer oversee operations at Kalich's store. In addition, Rich was given a final written warning for his inappropriate comments and would be required to take classes focused on promoting a professional work environment.</p>\n<p>On April 13, 2009, while on his leave of absence, Kalich notified AT &amp; T of his resignation. Kalich explained that the dynamics of the work environment had changed as a result of the EEO investigation, which included interviews with all of the store employees. In addition, Kalich feared that, despite being re-assigned to the supervision of Susan Suppley, he might nevertheless encounter Rich on occasion. Kalich was uncomfortable with the prospect of future encounters with Rich and, therefore, \"for mental and physical health reasons . . . felt it in [his] best interest to resign.\" Kalich's last day of employment with AT &amp; T was April 29, 2009.</p>\n<p>Kalich contends that Rich's conduct amounted to sexual harassment that created a hostile work environment. In his complaint, Kalich sought to impose liability on AT &amp; T for Rich's conduct pursuant to ELCRA, Michigan's civil rights statute. After the close of discovery, the district court granted AT &amp; T's motion for summary judgment, finding that Kalich had failed to present evidence in support of each element of his claim. Kalich timely appealed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. ANALYSIS</h2>\n<p>We review a district court's order granting summary judgment <i>de novo. </i><i>Int'l Union v.

Summary judgment is proper \"if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). After adequate time for discovery and upon motion, summary judgment is proper against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party's case, and upon which that party bears the burden of proof at trial. <i>Celotex Corp. v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">265</span></a></span> (1986).</p>\n<p>ELCRA prohibits employers from discriminating against employees based on sex, which includes sexual harassment. <i>See</i> Mich. Comp. Laws § 37.2102; <i>Chambers v. Trettco, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2211646\"><a href=\"/opinion/2211646/chambers-v-trettco-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">463</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">297</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2211646\"><a href=\"/opinion/2211646/chambers-v-trettco-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">614</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">910</span></a></span>, 915 (2000). Michigan law defines \"sexual harassment\" as \"unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct or communication of a sexual nature\" under circumstances where submission to the conduct or communication is made a \"quid pro quo\" of gaining or keeping employment or where the conduct or communication \"has the purpose or effect of substantially interfering with an individual's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*470</span> employment. . . .\" Mich. Comp. Laws § 37.2103(i).</p>\n<p>Sexual harassment that substantially interferes with an individual's employment is referred to as \"hostile work environment\" harassment. <i>Radtke v. Everett,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1309087\"><a href=\"/opinion/1309087/radtke-v-everett/\"><span class=\"volume\">442</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">368</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1309087\"><a href=\"/opinion/1309087/radtke-v-everett/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">155</span></a></span>, 161 (1993). Kalich does not allege that Rich conditioned his continued employment upon submission to any sexual advances or overtures. Rather, Kalich alleges that Rich's conduct created a hostile work environment. To establish a <i>prima facie</i> case of hostile work environment based on sexual harassment, Kalich was required to present evidence that: (1) he belonged to a protected group; (2) he was subjected to communication or conduct on the basis of sex; (3) he was subjected to unwelcome sexual conduct or communication; (4) the unwelcome conduct or communication was intended to or did substantially interfere with the plaintiff's employment or created an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment; and (5) respondeat superior. <i>Haynie v. State,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">468</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">302</span></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"848804\"><a href=\"/opinion/848804/haynie-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">664</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">129</span></a></span>, 133 (2003); <i>Chambers,</i> 614 N.W.2d at 915.</p>\n<p>In granting AT &amp; T's motion, the district court found that there was no dispute of material fact and that Kalich failed to present sufficient evidence on each element of his claim to withstand summary judgment. The court described Rich's conduct as \"crude, bullying, [and] despicable\" but found that it was \"not actionable under the sexual harassment hostile work environment provisions of ELCRA.\" We agree.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Protected Group</h2>\n<p>As to the first element of a hostile work environment sexual harassment claim, Kalich met his burden. The Michigan Supreme Court has held that \"all employees are inherently members of a protected class in hostile work environment cases because all persons may be discriminated against on the basis of sex.\" <i>Haynie,</i> 664 N.W.2d at 133 (quoting <i>Radtke,</i> 501 N.W.2d at 162). Accordingly, Kalich presented sufficient evidence of the first element of his <i>prima facie</i> case.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Communication or Conduct \"on the Basis of Sex\"</h2>\n<p>To establish the second element of his hostile work environment claim, Kalich needed to show that \"<i>but for</i> the fact of [his] sex, [he] would not have been the object of harassment.\" <i>Id.</i> (emphasis added) (quoting <i>Radtke,</i> 501 N.W.2d at 163). This element is derived from the language in section 37.2202(1)(a) of ELCRA which prohibits discrimination \"because of . . . sex.\" <i>Id.</i> at 308, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"848804\"><a href=\"/opinion/848804/haynie-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">664</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">129</span></a></span>. Stated differently, a plaintiff must show that the harassment was gender-based. <i>See </i><i>Barbour v. Dep't of Soc. Servs.,</i> 198 Mich.App. 183, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1914045\"><a href=\"/opinion/1914045/barbour-v-dss/\"><span class=\"volume\">497</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">216</span></a></span>, 218 (1993) (per curiam).

Harassment or discrimination because of a person's sexual orientation or perceived sexual orientation is not prohibited conduct under ELCRA. <i>Barbour,</i> 497 N.W.2d at 217-18.</p>\n<p>In <i>Vickers,</i> we evaluated a male plaintiff's claim of same-gender sexual harassment utilizing the Supreme Court's approach in <i>Oncale.</i><sup>[1]</sup> We identified three <span class=\"star-pagination\">*471</span> ways a male plaintiff could establish the \"because of sex\" element of a hostile work environment claim based on same-gender sexual harassment: (1) by showing that the harasser making sexual advances acted out of a sexual desire; (2) by showing that the harasser was motivated by general hostility to the presence of men in the workplace; or (3) by offering \"direct comparative evidence about how the alleged harasser treated members of both sexes in a mixed-sex workplace.\" <i>Vickers,</i> 453 F.3d at 765 (quoting <i>Oncale,</i> 523 U.S. at 80-81, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118181\"><a href=\"/opinion/118181/oncale-v-sundowner-offshore-services-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">998</span></a></span>).</p>\n<p>The district court properly concluded that Kalich failed to establish that Rich's conduct towards him was \"because of\" his gender. In his deposition, Kalich admitted that Rich made no apparent sexual advances toward him, nor indicated any sexual interest in him. Kalich did not present any evidence that Rich had a general hostility to men in the workplace, and Kalich did not offer comparative evidence that Rich generally treated women in the workplace more favorably than men. In fact, Kalich stated in his deposition that Rich was rude, aggressive and generally unapproachable towards <i>all employees.</i> Kalich even recounted a specific instance in which one of his colleaguesa female manager at another store locationcalled Kalich in tears after a meeting in which Rich \"yelled and screamed\" at her.</p>\n<p>By all accounts, Kalich established that Rich created very unpleasant working conditions for the employees that were in Rich's chain-of-command. While Kalich seemed to be the primary target of Rich's campaign of teasing and name-calling, there is no evidence that Rich singled Kalich out \"because of\" his gender. In fact, Kalich acknowledged in his deposition that he believed Rich made the derogatory comments because he knew or suspected that Kalich was gay. Under Michigan law, as under Title VII, sexual orientation is not a protected classification. <i>Barbour,</i> 497 N.W.2d at 217-18. Thus, harassment or discrimination based upon a person's sexual orientation cannot form the basis of a cognizable claim. <i>Id.</i> Moreover, teasing and name-calling, while inappropriate in a professional environment, are insufficient to state a claim for sexual harassment. <i>See </i><i>Schemansky v. California Pizza Kitchen, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2580351\"><a href=\"/opinion/2580351/schemansky-v-california-pizza-kitchen-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Unwelcome Sexual Conduct or Communication</h2>\n<p>In addition to the requirement that he was singled out because of his gender, Kalich was also required to present evidence that he was \"subjected to unwelcome sexual conduct or communication.\" <i>Haynie,</i> 664 N.W.2d at 133. This element is derived from the language in § 37.2103(i) of ELCRA, which states that \"[s]exual harassment means unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct or communication of a sexual nature. . . .\" <i>Id.</i> The Michigan Supreme Court has held that \"actionable sexual harassment requires conduct or communication that <i>inherently</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*472</span> pertains to sex.\" <i>Corley v.

Discriminatory conduct that is gender-based but not sexual in nature does not constitute sexual harassment. <i>Haynie,</i> 664 N.W.2d at 135.</p>\n<p>In his brief, Kalich argues:</p>\n<blockquote>David Rich's conduct towards Plaintiff was of an \"inherently\" sexual nature because: (1) Rich's admitted comments to and about Plaintiff that he was a necrophiliac are by definition of a sexual nature, (2) Rich's repeated remarks to Plaintiff that related to his gender and implied that he was a homosexual when Plaintiff never discussed his sexual orientation with Rich inherently relate to sex because they were intended to \"bring him out of the closet,\" and (3) Rich made some of his offensive remarks to Plaintiff in such a manner that manifested his sexual desire for Plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<p>Putting aside the necrophiliac comment, which is discussed below, Kalich contends that comments designed to \"bring him out of the closet\" as a homosexual man inherently relate to sex. Kalich cites <i>Barbour</i> for the proposition that such comments \"state[ ] a claim for same gender [sic] hostile work environment sexual harassment because such conduct directly relates to gender.\"</p>\n<p>Kalich's reading of <i>Barbour</i> is simply wrong. Barbour filed a complaint pursuant to ELCRA, alleging that throughout his employment with the defendant he was the victim of sexual harassment by co-workers and supervisors. 497 N.W.2d at 217. Barbour claimed he was subjected to various forms of verbal and nonverbal harassment in efforts to get him to \"come out of the closet . . . and to engage in homosexual sex.\" <i>Id.</i> There was no dispute that Barbour's sexual orientation constituted the subject matter of the harassment. <i>Id.</i> The trial court concluded that harassment or discrimination based upon a person's sexual orientation was not conduct prohibited by ELCRA and granted summary disposition in favor of the defendant. <i>Id.</i> at 218. The Michigan Court of Appeals affirmed this portion of the trial court's judgment. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>However, the court of appeals found that the trial court erred in dismissing another portion of Barbour's complaint \"insofar as it alleged <i>specific homosexual advances directed to him by his supervisor.</i>\" <i>Id.</i> (emphasis added). The court found that \"these actions were directly related to plaintiff's status as a male, and thus render[ed] the act applicable.\" <i>Id.</i> Therefore, <i>Barbour</i> is better understood as standing for the proposition that, regardless of the target's sexual orientation, a supervisor's unwanted sexual advance is conduct that <i>could</i> state a claim for hostile work environment sexual harassment.<sup>[2]</sup> After all, it is conduct that is directed at a particular person \"because of\" that person's gender (i.e., the gender to which the harasser is attracted), <i>and</i> it is conduct that is inherently sexual in nature. Therefore, the part of Barbour's complaint that stated a cognizable claim was based not on Barbour's status as a homosexual or on the harasser's motivation to \"bring him out of the closet,\" but rather on the fact that Barbour was subjected to unwanted sexual advances, conduct which was unquestionably \"sexual in nature\" and \"because of\" Barbour's gender.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*473</span> Kalich has not alleged that Rich made any sexual advances towards him. He presented no evidence that Rich's teasing was borne out of a sexual desire for Kalich or even that Rich himself is homosexual. Although Kalich argues in his brief that the comments referring to him as a girl \"demonstrate[ ] Rich's sexual desire for him,\" he bases this conclusion on the fact that \"Rich made these comments while pointing and staring at [Kalich's] behind.\" According to Kalich, \"It is not a leap to believe that Rich was sexually attracted to [him] because [Rich] was staring at [his] behind while commenting about his physique.\" While this argument boasts a certain logic, we must base our decision on evidence, and the evidence of record does not support the conclusion Kalich urges. In Kalich's deposition, counsel for AT &amp; T pointedly asked him, \"Did Rich ever indicate that he had a sexual interest in you?\" Kalich's response was an unequivocal \"no.\" Kalich's contention on appeal that a certain remark \"could arguably manifest Rich's sexual desire for [him],\" is thus belied by his prior testimony to the contrary. In any event, the standard is not whether certain conduct or comments could \"arguably manifest\" sexual desire, but whether the conduct or comments \"<i>inherently pertain</i> to sex.\" Rich's comments do not meet that standard.</p>\n<p>Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Kalich, the vast majority of the comments Kalich cited in his complaint cannot be construed as sexual in nature. Rich's remarks about Kalich's glasses, or referring to Kalich by various female names, or about his \"cute\" dog do not inherently pertain to sex, nor do Rich's remarks about the fit of Kalich's clothes, his sewing abilities, or that he was \"wasting away\" and \"looked like a girl.\" The district court acknowledged that Rich's comment referring to Kalich as a necrophiliac, however, was sexual in nature. Nevertheless, Kalich presented no evidence that Rich directed this comment at him \"because of\" his gender. Without evidence of some gender-based animus, the mere fact that Rich made a comment to Kalich that was sexual in nature cannot form the basis of a cognizable claim. <i>See </i><i>Oncale,</i> 523 U.S. at 80, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118181\"><a href=\"/opinion/118181/oncale-v-sundowner-offshore-services-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">998</span></a></span> (\"We have never held that workplace harassment. . . is automatically discrimination because of sex merely because the words used have sexual content or connotations. The critical issue . . . is whether members of one sex are exposed to disadvantageous terms or conditions of employment to which members of the other sex are not exposed.\") (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. Intimidating, Hostile or Offensive Work Environment</h2>\n<p>Another essential component of a hostile work environment claim requires the plaintiff to show that the unwelcome sexual conduct or communications were intended to or did in fact substantially interfere with the plaintiff's employment or created an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment. <i>Haynie,</i> 664 N.W.2d at 133. \"The essence of a hostile work environment action is that one or more supervisors or coworkers create an atmosphere so infused with hostility toward members of one sex that they alter the conditions of employment for them.\" <i>Radtke,</i> 501 N.W.2d at 163 (citations omitted). The existence of a hostile work environment \"shall be determined by whether a reasonable person, in the totality of the circumstances, would have perceived the conduct at issue as substantially interfering with the plaintiff's employment or having the purpose or effect of creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment.\" <i>Id.</i> at 167. Factors relevant to the inquiry include: the frequency of the discriminatory conduct; the conduct's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*474</span> severity; whether the conduct was physically threatening or humiliating or merely an offensive utterance; and whether the conduct unreasonably interfered with the employee's work performance. <i>See </i><i>Quinto,</i> 547 N.W.2d at 320 (quoting <i>Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112911\"><a href=\"/opinion/112911/harris-v-forklift-systems-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">510</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">17</span></a></span>, 23, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112911\"><a href=\"/opinion/112911/harris-v-forklift-systems-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">367</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112911\"><a href=\"/opinion/112911/harris-v-forklift-systems-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">295</span></a></span> (1993)). Except in the case of extreme incidents such as rape or sexual assault, a single, isolated event is typically insufficient to create a hostile work environment. <i>See </i><i>Radtke,</i> 501 N.W.2d at 168 &amp; n. 40.</p>\n<p>The single necrophilia comment that Rich directed at Kalich, the only comment Kalich cites that could conceivably constitute sexual harassment, is not the sort of \"extremely traumatic experience\" that Michigan courts recognize as creating a hostile work environment based on a single occurrence. Under the applicable standard, a reasonable person would not perceive this single remark as being so severe and extreme as to create an objectively hostile work environment. The remainder of Rich's remarks, though unprofessional and perhaps subjectively hurtful, embarrassing, or offensive to Kalich, are not actionable under ELCRA because, as discussed above, they are not inherently sexual in nature. Therefore, the record before the district court was insufficient to withstand summary judgment on this element of Kalich's claim as well.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>E. Respondeat Superior</h2>\n<p>The final element of the <i>prima facie</i> case for hostile work environment sexual harassment requires the plaintiff to establish that the employer had either actual or constructive notice of the hostile work environment and failed to take prompt and adequate remedial action. <i>Betts v. Costco Wholesale Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1354993\"><a href=\"/opinion/1354993/betts-v-costco-wholesale-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">558</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">461</span></a></span>, 470-71 (6th Cir.2009) (citing <i>Sheridan v. Forest Hills Pub. Schs.,</i> 247 Mich.App. 611, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1274191\"><a href=\"/opinion/1274191/sheridan-v-forest-hills-public-schools/\"><span class=\"volume\">637</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">536</span></a></span>, 542 (2001)). \"[A]n employer can be vicariously liable for a hostile work environment <i>only if</i> it `failed to take prompt and adequate remedial action upon reasonable notice of the creation of a hostile work environment.'\" <i>Elezovic v. Ford Motor Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"848648\"><a href=\"/opinion/848648/elezovic-v-ford-motor-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">472</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">408</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"848648\"><a href=\"/opinion/848648/elezovic-v-ford-motor-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">697</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">851</span></a></span>, 863 (2005) (emphasis added) (quoting <i>Chambers,</i> 614 N.W.2d at 918). To establish actual notice, a plaintiff must show that he reported the harassment to someone in \"higher management\"that is, to \"someone in the employer's chain of command who possesses the ability to exercise significant influence in the decision-making process of hiring, firing, and disciplining the offensive employee.\" <i>Sheridan,</i> 637 N.W.2d at 542-43. A plaintiff can establish constructive notice by showing that the harassment was so pervasive as to warrant an inference that the employer had actual knowledge or to charge the employer with constructive knowledge. <i>Sheridan,</i> 637 N.W.2d at 542. When determining the adequacy of the employer's remedial action, the proper inquiry is \"whether the action reasonably served to prevent future harassment of the plaintiff.\" <i>Chambers,</i> 614 N.W.2d at 919.</p>\n<p>AT &amp; T did not have actual notice of Kalich's complaint until sometime on or after March 19, 2009, the date that Kalich's attorney drafted the letter to Gaffga. On March 27, 2009, Marybeth Dunne, a Senior EEO Consultant with AT &amp; T, was assigned to conduct the investigation into Kalich's complaint. Dunne instructed Rich not to visit Kalich's store during the pendency of the investigation, and Rich complied.<sup>[3]</sup> In the course of her investigation, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*475</span> Dunne interviewed Kalich, Rich, and the other employees of the Clarkston store. During an interview, Dunne specifically asked Kalich what type of resolution he was seeking, to which Kalich responded, \"I don't know.\" Dunne completed her investigation on April 7, 2009 and concluded that Rich had made \"inappropriate comments\" to Kalich. Dunne recommended that AT &amp; T issue Rich a disciplinary warning, require Rich to attend special training, and remove Rich from Kalich's chain-of-command, all of which AT &amp; T did. On April 9, 2009, AT &amp; T informed Kalich that Susan Suppley would be his new supervisor. Four days later, Kalich notified Gaffga of his resignation.</p>\n<p>Based on the record, Kalich presented no evidence that AT &amp; T failed to adequately rectify the problem upon receiving notice. Kalich's brief emphasizes that AT &amp; T did not formalize Rich's transfer or issue the final disciplinary warning until nearly one month after his letter of complaint, but it is clear that an investigation began within a week of Kalich's letter and concluded only ten business days later. Performing an adequate investigation, which in this case included an interview of every employee at the Clarkston store, takes time. Moreover, upon the initiation of the investigation, AT &amp; T instructed Rich to have no further contact with Kalich, and ultimately, AT &amp; T permanently reassigned Rich to a different region. This resolution certainly was designed to prevent future harassment of Kalich. Thus, under the applicable standard, AT &amp; T took adequate remedial measures and there is no basis upon which to impose respondeat superior liability. <i>See </i><i>Chambers,</i> 614 N.W.2d at 919.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Because Kalich has failed to produce sufficient evidence to establish each element of his claim, we AFFIRM the district court's summary disposition in favor of AT &amp; T.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Although <i>Vickers</i> was a case that arose under Title VII, Michigan courts afford substantial consideration to federal precedent when interpreting analogous provisions of ELCRA. <i>See </i><i>Chambers,</i> 614 N.W.2d at 917; <i>Radtke v. Everett,</i> 471 N.W.2d at 663; <i>Barrett v. Kirtland Cmty.

At the time, Rich was unaware of Kalich's complaint.</p>\n\n</div>",
