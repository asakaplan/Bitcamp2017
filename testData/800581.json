Defendant-appellant Mark Greeno appeals from the\ndistrict court’s judgment sentencing him to 87 months in prison for conspiracy with\nintent to distribute methamphetamine in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a) and (b)(1)(A).\nGreeno contends that the district court erred when it applied a dangerous weapon\nenhancement to his sentence, pursuant to Section 2D1.1(b)(1) of the U.S. Sentencing\n\n\n        *\n          The Honorable Arthur L. Alarcón, Senior Circuit Judge of the United States Court of Appeals\nfor the Ninth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\n\n                                                 1\n\fNo. 10-6279            United States v. Greeno                                 Page 2\n\n\nGuidelines. Greeno also asserts that application of the Section 2D1.1(b)(1) dangerous\nweapon enhancement violated his Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. For\nthe reasons that follow, we affirm the district court.\n\n                                                  I.\n\n       In May 2009, as part of an ongoing investigation of a methamphetamine\ntrafficking conspiracy in Tennessee and Georgia, law enforcement officers conducted\ntwo controlled purchases of methamphetamine at Greeno’s property. Within three days\nof the second controlled purchase, Officers Eric Allman, Toby Norris, and Dax\nMcGowan executed a search warrant on Greeno’s property, which contained a house,\na recreational vehicle (“RV”), and a garage.1\n\n       Officer Norris found a five-shot revolver between the bed and wall of Greeno’s\nRV. The revolver was near drug paraphernalia, including black electrical tape that was\nsimilar to the packaging used on methamphetamine purchased by officers in other\ncontrolled purchases. Officer McGowan searched Greeno’s garage and found a handgun\nin the laundry room. He also found an unloaded rifle and ammunition in a nearby tool\nroom. A few yards outside the garage, officers found a canister of methamphetamine\nburied in the ground. Officers also found a smaller package of methamphetamine\nwrapped in black electrical tape outside Greeno’s RV.\n\n       In January 2010, the Government charged Greeno, along with twenty-three other\nindividuals, with, inter alia, conspiracy to distribute at least fifty grams of\nmethamphetamine or at least five hundred grams of a mixture and substance containing\nmethamphetamine in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a) and (b)(1)(A). A few months later,\nGreeno pleaded guilty to the conspiracy charge pursuant to a written plea agreement.\nThe district court dismissed the remaining count against Greeno pursuant to the plea\nagreement.\n\n\n\n\n       1\n           Greeno lived in the RV during construction on the house.\n\fNo. 10-6279        United States v. Greeno                                        Page 3\n\n\n       At Greeno’s sentencing hearing, the district court adopted the presentence\ninvestigation report and applied the advisory Sentencing Guidelines in determining his\nsentence. The district court applied a two-level enhancement to Greeno’s offense level\nfor possession of a dangerous weapon during a drug offense, pursuant to Section\n2D1.1(b)(1) of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines. The application of this enhancement\nresulted in an overall offense level of 29, which increased his advisory Guidelines range\nfrom 70 to 87 months in prison to 87 to 108 months in prison.\n\n       At the sentencing hearing, Greeno objected to the application of the\nSection 2D1.1(b)(1) dangerous weapon enhancement. He argued that there was\ninsufficient evidence connecting the firearms found on his property with his drug\ntrafficking offense. He also contended that the firearms were for personal protection.\nIn response, the Government presented testimony from Officers Allman, Norris, and\nMcGowan regarding their search of Greeno’s property and the controlled\nmethamphetamine purchases conducted at Greeno’s home. Greeno’s counsel cross-\nexamined the officers, but did not present any evidence at the sentencing hearing.\n\n       The district court concluded that the Government had met its burden of showing\nthat Greeno possessed a dangerous weapon during his drug trafficking offense and that\nGreeno had failed to produce any evidence demonstrating that it was clearly improbable\nthat the weapon was connected to his offense. Thus, the court overruled Greeno’s\nobjection to the Section 2D1.1(b)(1) dangerous weapon enhancement and sentenced him\nto 87 months in prison.\n\n       Greeno filed a timely notice of appeal on October 19, 2010, following entry of\njudgment on October 14, 2010. The district court had jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C.\n§ 3231. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291.\n\n                                             II.\n\n       Greeno contends in this appeal that the district court erred by applying the\nSection 2D1.1(b)(1) dangerous weapon enhancement to his sentence because the\nGovernment did not present sufficient evidence to show that Greeno possessed a firearm\n\fNo. 10-6279        United States v. Greeno                                          Page 4\n\n\nin connection with his drug trafficking offense. He also maintains that the application\nof this enhancement violates his Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. This\nCircuit reviews a district court’s interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines de novo and\nits “findings of fact at sentencing for clear error.” United States v. Baker, 559 F.3d 443,\n448 (6th Cir. 2009).\n\n                                             A.\n\n       Pursuant to Section 2D1.1(b)(1), a two-level enhancement may be added to the\nbase offense level of a defendant convicted of a drug offense “[i]f a dangerous weapon\n(including a firearm) was possessed.” U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual § 2D1.1(b)(1)\n[hereinafter Sentencing Guidelines]. “The enhancement should be applied if the weapon\nwas present, unless it is clearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the\noffense.” Id. § 2D1.1 cmt. n.3(A).\n\n       Under Section 2D1.1(b)(1), the government has the burden of showing “by a\npreponderance of the evidence that ‘(1) the defendant actually or constructively\n‘possessed’ the weapon, and (2) such possession was during the commission of the\noffense.’” United States v. Catalan, 499 F.3d 604, 606 (6th Cir. 2007) (quoting United\nStates v. Hill, 79 F.3d 1477, 1485 (6th Cir. 1996)). This Court has previously\nrecognized that the 1991 amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines removed the\nrequirement that the weapon be possessed during the commission of the crime. United\nStates v. Faison, 339 F.3d 518, 520 (6th Cir. 2003). “[A]ll that the government need\nshow is that the dangerous weapon [was] possessed during ‘relevant conduct.’” Id.\n\n       This Court has also recognized that although the Government’s burden contains\n“two separate inquiries, in most instances they collapse into a single factual\ndetermination because the weapon was present when the arrest took place or where the\ncrime was committed.” United States v. Sanchez, 928 F.2d 1450, 1460 (6th Cir. 1991),\nabrogated on other grounds by United States v. Jackson-Randolph, 282 F.3d 369 (6th\nCir. 2002). In such “instances, once the government proves a defendant was in\npossession of a weapon, its burden is satisfied.” Id.\n\fNo. 10-6279        United States v. Greeno                                            Page 5\n\n\n       Once the government meets its burden, “a [rebuttable] presumption arises that\n‘the weapon was connected to the offense.’” United States v. Wheaton, 517 F.3d 350,\n367 (6th Cir. 2008) (quoting United States v. Hough, 276 F.3d 884, 894 (6th Cir. 2002)).\nThe burden then “shifts to the defendant to show that it was ‘clearly improbable’ that the\nweapon was connected to the offense.” Catalan, 499 F.3d at 606. A defendant must\npresent evidence, not mere argument, in order to meet his or her burden. See Hough,\n276 F.3d at 894 (“[S]peculation is not evidence and does not establish that it was ‘clearly\nimprobable’ that [the defendant] possessed the firearms during the offense.”); see also\nWheaton, 517 F.3d at 368 (“The bare assertion of Wheaton’s counsel that the gun might\nsimply have been for the lawful purpose of defending the residence is insufficient to\nsustain Wheaton’s burden of showing it was ‘clearly improbable’ that the gun was\nrelated to the drug conspiracy.”).\n\n       This Court considers the following factors, none of which is alone controlling,\nwhen determining whether the application of a Section 2D1.1(b)(1) enhancement was\nappropriate:\n\n       (1) the type of firearm involved; (2) the accessibility of the weapon to the\n       defendant; (3) the presence of ammunition; (4) the proximity of the\n       weapon to illicit drugs, proceeds, or paraphernalia; (5) the defendant’s\n       evidence concerning the use of the weapon; and (6) whether the\n       defendant was actually engaged in drug-trafficking, rather than mere\n       manufacturing or possession.\n\nUnited States v. Edmonds, 9 F. App’x 330, 332 (6th Cir. 2001) (citing United States v.\nCalhoun, 49 F.3d 231, 237 (6th Cir. 1995); United States v. Chalkias, 971 F.2d 1206,\n1217 (6th Cir. 1992); United States v. McGhee, 882 F.2d 1095, 1099 (6th Cir. 1989)).\n\n       The district court did not err in concluding that the Government presented\nsufficient evidence to meet its burden. The search was conducted only a few days after\nthe controlled purchase of methamphetamine at Greeno’s property. The firearms were\nfound throughout the property in relatively close proximity to drugs and drug\nparaphernalia. Thus, regardless of where Greeno was on the property, he had ready\n\fNo. 10-6279        United States v. Greeno                                       Page 6\n\n\naccess to the firearms. Greeno does not dispute that he possessed the firearms, nor that\nthe firearms were found on his property during the existence of the drug conspiracy.\n\n       Greeno nonetheless contends that the district court erred by applying the\nSection 2D1.1(b)(1) enhancement because there was no direct evidence showing he\npossessed a firearm when he sold drugs or that the firearms were found with drugs or\ndrug paraphernalia. Greeno relies on United States v. Jock, 239 F. App’x 126 (6th Cir.\n2007), Baker, 559 F.3d 443, United States v. Woods, 604 F.3d 286 (6th Cir. 2010), and\nUnited States v. Wright, 426 F. App’x 412 (6th Cir. 2011), to support this contention.\n\n       Greeno’s reliance on Jock is misplaced. Greeno referred to docket number 06-\n5595 in citing Jock. That docket number is associated with a Sixth Circuit decision\naffirming the defendant’s resentencing after an earlier remand in 2005. Jock, 239 F.\nApp’x at 127. To the extent Greeno intended to cite the 2005 decision in United States\nv. Jock, 148 F. App’x 519 (6th Cir. 2005), that decision reversed the district court’s\nsentence because the district court treated the Guidelines as mandatory in violation of\nUnited States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220 (2005). Jock, 148 F. App’x at 523-24. Greeno\ndoes not contend there was a Booker error in this case.\n\n       Greeno’s reliance on Baker and Wright is also misplaced. Neither case involves\na challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the application of a\nSection 2D1.1(b)(1) enhancement. The Baker case involves a challenge to a career\noffender enhancement. Baker, 559 F.3d at 450, 453. The Wright case involves a\nchallenge to the district court’s consideration of uncharged crimes when determining a\ndefendant’s sentence. Wright, 426 F. App’x at 415-16. While both decisions reversed\nand remanded for resentencing, Greeno has not pointed to any portion of either of these\ndecisions that supports his argument in this appeal.\n\n       Greeno’s reliance on Woods is also misplaced. While the court in Woods\nreversed the district court’s application of a Section 2D1.1(b)(1) enhancement, the\nenhancement was based on possession of a firearm by a co-conspirator. Woods, 604\nF.3d at 290-92. The district court’s application of the Section 2D1.1(b)(1) enhancement\nin this case was not based on possession of a firearm by a co-conspirator.\n\fNo. 10-6279         United States v. Greeno                                           Page 7\n\n\n        Greeno did not offer any evidence demonstrating that it was clearly improbable\nthat the firearms were connected to his drug offense and, thus, did not meet his burden.\nIf a defendant fails to meet his or her burden of showing that it was clearly improbable\nthat a firearm was connected to a drug offense, “the district court should apply the\nenhancement.” Catalan, 499 F.3d at 606-07. Because Greeno did not meet his burden,\nthe district court did not err when it applied the Section 2D1.1(b)(1) dangerous weapon\nenhancement to Greeno’s sentence.\n\n                                              B.\n\n                                              1.\n\n        Although Greeno’s articulation of his Second Amendment challenge in his brief\nis somewhat conclusory and unclear, contrary to the Government’s contentions, he did\nnot waive it. This Circuit has recognized that even a “bare bones” argument may survive\na waiver challenge. See United States v. Erpenbeck, 532 F.3d 423, 434 (6th Cir. 2008)\n(concluding that a “bare bones” argument raised in a footnote “is not so undeveloped as\nto constitute a waiver”). Greeno identified the Second Amendment issue in his brief\nunder the header “Issues Presented for Appeal.” Greeno also addressed his Second\nAmendment challenge on pages 12 and 13 of his brief. Moreover, Greeno cited and\nrelied on Supreme Court decisions in District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570\n(2008), and McDonald v. City of Chicago, 130 S. Ct. 3020 (2010), in support of his\nchallenge.\n\n        Greeno’s Second Amendment challenge, however, is subject to plain error\nreview because he did not raise it in the district court. A defendant who fails to present\nan issue to the district court forfeits the benefit of full review, such that appellate review\nis limited to determining whether the district court committed plain error. See United\nStates v. Skipper, 552 F.3d 489, 491 (6th Cir. 2009) (“Skipper did not present this\nargument to the district court, so our review is limited to determining whether the district\ncourt committed plain error.”).\n\fNo. 10-6279         United States v. Greeno                                          Page 8\n\n\n        Greeno has not cited any portion of the record showing that he raised his Second\nAmendment challenge in the district court. Based on our review of the transcript from\nthe sentencing hearing, Greeno’s counsel referred to the Second Amendment only once:\nduring cross-examination of Officer McGowan.             Defense counsel asked Officer\nMcGowan if Greeno “had a good Second Amendment right to own weapons?” to which\nthe officer responded “[y]eah.” R. 628 at 49-50. This single question is not enough to\nraise his Second Amendment challenge because it does not establish a detailed record\nfor review on appeal. Thus, we review for plain error.\n\n                                              2.\n\n        On plain error review, we must first determine “whether an error occurred in the\ndistrict court.” United States v. Thomas, 11 F.3d 620, 630 (6th Cir. 1993). If we\nconclude that no error occurred, the “inquiry is at an end.” Id. In order to determine if\nan error occurred in the district court in this case, we must determine whether Greeno’s\nSecond Amendment right to keep and bear arms, as recognized in Heller, was\nimpermissibly restricted by application of the Section 2D1.1(b)(1) enhancement.\n\n                                              a.\n\n        The Second Amendment provides: “A well-regulated Militia, being necessary\nto the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be\ninfringed.” U.S. Const. amend. II. The Supreme Court held in Heller that the Second\nAmendment protects an individual’s right to keep and bear arms without regard to\nMilitia service. Heller, 554 U.S. at 595, 598-99. The Court held that the Second\nAmendment codified the pre-existing right to keep and bear arms. See id. at 592\n(explaining that “it has always been widely understood that the Second Amendment, like\nthe First and Fourth Amendments, codified a pre-existing right”). The core right\nrecognized in Heller is “the right of law-abiding, responsible citizens to use arms in\ndefense of hearth and home.” Id. at 635.\n\n        The Court, however, recognized that the Second Amendment right to keep and\nbear arms “is not unlimited.” Id. at 626. For example, the Court recognized the\n\fNo. 10-6279         United States v. Greeno                                          Page 9\n\n\n“historical tradition of prohibiting the carrying of dangerous and unusual weapons.” Id.\nat 627 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Court read its prior decision in United\nStates v. Miller, 307 U.S. 174 (1939) “to say only that the Second Amendment does not\nprotect those weapons not typically possessed by law-abiding citizens for lawful\npurposes, such as short-barreled shotguns.” Heller, 554 U.S. at 625.\n\n        The Court also recognized that “[f]rom Blackstone through the 19th-century\ncases, commentators and courts routinely explained that the right was not a right to keep\nand carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose.”\nId. at 626. The Court declined to define the full scope of the Second Amendment right,\nbut did articulate a non-exhaustive list of presumptively lawful regulations:\n\n        [N]othing in [the] opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding\n        prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill,\n        or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as\n        schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and\n        qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.\n\nId. at 626-27, 627 n.26.\n\n        Because the list contains the prohibition on the possession of firearms by felons,\nthis Circuit has relied on it to reject Second Amendment challenges to federal felon-in-\npossession of a firearm convictions and related expungement exceptions. See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Carey, 602 F.3d 738, 741 (6th Cir. 2010) (“In short, Heller states that\nthe Second Amendment right is not unlimited, and in fact, it is specifically limited in the\ncase of felon prohibitions. Because Congress’s prohibition on felon possession of\nfirearms is constitutional, it follows that the burdens associated with the congressionally-\ncreated expungement exception in 18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(20) do not violate the Second\nAmendment.” (citation omitted)); United States v. Whisnant, 391 F. App’x 426, 430 (6th\nCir. 2010) (relying on Carey and rejecting Second Amendment challenge to felon in\npossession of firearm conviction).\n\n        Because the list does not contain the Section 2D1.1(b)(1) dangerous weapon\nenhancement at issue in this case, we cannot rely on the list, alone, to reject Greeno’s\n\fNo. 10-6279        United States v. Greeno                                        Page 10\n\n\nSecond Amendment challenge. See United States v. Chester, 628 F.3d 673, 679 (4th Cir.\n2010) (“Some courts have treated Heller’s listing of ‘presumptively lawful regulatory\nmeasures,’ for all practical purposes, as a kind of ‘safe harbor’ for unlisted regulatory\nmeasures, such as 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(9), which they deem to be analogous to those\nmeasures specifically listed in Heller. . . This approach, however, approximates rational-\nbasis review, which has been rejected by Heller.” (citation omitted)).\n\n       This Circuit has not yet reached the merits of a post-Heller Second Amendment\nchallenge to a Section 2D1.1(b)(1) dangerous weapon enhancement in a published\ndecision. See United States v. Walker, 351 F. App’x 16, 18 (6th Cir. 2009) (declining\nto reach the merits of the defendant’s post-Heller Second Amendment challenge to a\nSection 2D1.1(b)(1) enhancement because the defendant waived the challenge by\naccepting the enhancement in his plea agreement); United States v. Hurley, 278 F. App’x\n574, 576 (6th Cir. 2008) (declining to reach the merits of the defendant’s post-Heller\nSecond Amendment challenge to a Section 2D1.1(b)(1) enhancement because the\ndefendant waived the challenge by failing to develop the argument in his brief).\n\n                                             b.\n\n       Since the Supreme Court’s decision in Heller, courts have wrestled with its text\nto develop a sound approach to resolving Second Amendment challenges. Several\ncircuits have adopted a two-pronged approach. See United States v. Marzzarella, 614\nF.3d 85, 89 (3d Cir. 2010) (“As we read Heller, it suggests a two-pronged approach to\nSecond Amendment challenges.”); Chester, 628 F.3d at 680 (applying two-pronged\napproach); Ezell v. City of Chicago, 651 F.3d 684, 701-03 (7th Cir. 2011) (same); United\nStates v. Reese, 627 F.3d 792, 800-01 (10th Cir. 2010) (same).\n\n       Under the first prong, the court asks whether the challenged law burdens conduct\nthat falls within the scope of the Second Amendment right, as historically understood.\nChester, 628 F.3d at 680. As the Seventh Circuit recognized, “Heller suggests that some\nfederal gun laws will survive Second Amendment challenge because they regulate\nactivity falling outside the terms of the right as publicly understood when the Bill of\nRights was ratified.” Ezell, 651 F.3d at 702. If the Government demonstrates that the\n\fNo. 10-6279         United States v. Greeno                                         Page 11\n\n\nchallenged statute “regulates activity falling outside the scope of the Second Amendment\nright as it was understood at the relevant historical moment--1791 [Bill of Rights\nratification] or 1868 [Fourteenth Amendment ratification]--then the analysis can stop\nthere; the regulated activity is categorically unprotected, and the law is not subject to\nfurther Second Amendment review.” Id. at 702-03.\n\n        “If the government cannot establish this--if the historical evidence is inconclusive\nor suggests that the regulated activity is not categorically unprotected-- then there must\nbe a second inquiry into the strength of the government’s justification for restricting or\nregulating the exercise of Second Amendment rights.” Id. at 703. Under this prong, the\ncourt applies the appropriate level of scrutiny. Marzzarella, 614 F.3d at 89. If the law\nsatisfies the applicable standard, it is constitutional. Id. If it does not, “it is invalid.”\nId.\n\n        We find this two-pronged approach appropriate and, thus, adopt it in this Circuit.\nUnder the first prong, we must determine whether the Section 2D1.1(b)(1) enhancement\nburdens conduct that falls within the scope of the Second Amendment right as\nhistorically understood. If the enhancement falls outside the scope of the Second\nAmendment right as historically understood, the possession of a weapon during a drug\noffense is unprotected and our inquiry ends.\n\n        According to Heller, the Second Amendment right as historically understood\nprotects the right of individuals to keep and bear arms for self-defense. Heller, 554 U.S.\nat 628. As stated above, the core right recognized in Heller is “the right of law-abiding,\nresponsible citizens to use arms in defense of hearth and home.” Id. at 635. Since the\nSecond Amendment recognized the pre-existing right to keep and bear arms, we look to\nearly restrictions on the possession and use of weapons.\n\n        As a preliminary matter, we acknowledge that the Section 2D1.1(b)(1)\nenhancement, as well as laws prohibiting the possession, use, and distribution of\nnarcotics are of relatively recent vintage. The Section 2D1.1(b)(1) enhancement was\nfirst introduced in 1987. Sentencing Guidelines § 2D1.1(b)(1) (1987). State laws\nprohibiting the sale of certain narcotics were first introduced in the late Nineteenth\n\fNo. 10-6279        United States v. Greeno                                        Page 12\n\n\nCentury. See Margarita Mercado Echegaray, Drug Prohibition in America: Federal\nDrug Policy and its Consequences, 75 Rev. Jur. U.P.R. 1215, 1219 (2006) (“In light of\nwidespread use during the nineteenth century, states enacted legislation to curb drug use\nin America.”); see, e.g., In re Ah Lung, 45 F. 684, 685 (N.D. Cal. 1891) (discussing San\nFrancisco city ordinance prohibiting sale, gift, or delivery of opium or morphine); Luck\nv. Sears, 29 Or. 421, 423 (Or. 1896) (discussing 1887 state statute prohibiting the sale\nand gift of opium, morphine, and other substances). While earlier federal drug-related\nlaws involved labeling and taxation, the first comprehensive federal drug law targeting\ndrug trafficking was enacted in 1970 in the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and\nControl Act of 1970, Pub. L. No. 91-513, 84 Stat. 1236. See Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U.S.\n1, 10 (2005) (discussing federal drug regulations).\n\n        The mere fact that drug laws and the Section 2D1.1(b)(1) enhancement were not\nenacted until recently does not automatically render the possession of weapons by drug\ntraffickers within the scope of the Second Amendment right as historically understood.\nNothing in Heller suggests such a static reading of the Second Amendment. Thus, we\nlook to the broader question of whether the Second Amendment right, as historically\nunderstood, protected the possession of weapons by individuals engaged in criminal\nactivity.\n\n        At common law, the right to keep and bear arms was not unlimited. For example,\nthere was a historical tradition prohibiting the possession of dangerous or unusual\nweapons. Heller, 554 U.S. at 627; see State v. Hirsch, 338 Or. 622, 676 (Or. 2005)\n(discussing common law right to keep and bear arms and that “[n]othing in the history\nof the English right suggests that the drafters of the English Bill of Rights intended the\narms provision to preclude the disarmament of serious lawbreakers”); see, e.g., State v.\nHuntly, 3 Ired. 418, 418 (N.C. 1843) (discussing the common law history of the offense\nof riding or going armed with dangerous or unusual weapons, to the terror of the people).\n\n        In the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries, numerous states separately\npenalized, or increased the severity of punishment for, crimes committed by individuals\nwho used a weapon during the commission of a crime. See Saul Cornell & Nathan\n\fNo. 10-6279         United States v. Greeno                                        Page 13\n\n\nDeDino, A Well Regulated Right: The Early American Origins of Gun Control, 73\nFordham L. Rev. 487, 501 (2004) (discussing history of right to keep and bear arms and\nexplaining that, in the Founding Era, “justices of the peace, sheriffs, and constables were\nempowered to disarm individuals who ride about armed in terror of the peace”); see, e.g.,\nState v. O’Neil, 71 Minn. 399, 401 (Minn. 1898) (discussing Minnesota statute that\nclassified a robbery committed by a person armed with a dangerous weapon as first\ndegree robbery); People v. Rockhill, 26 N.Y.S. 222, 223-24 (N.Y. 1893) (discussing\nNew York statute defining first degree assault as including assaults with intent to kill by\na person with a loaded firearm or other deadly weapon); State v. Cash, 16 P. 144, 145\n(Kan. 1887) (discussing Kansas statute characterizing first degree burglary as committed\nby a person who, inter alia, is armed with a dangerous weapon); State v. Tutt, 63 Mo.\n595, 599 (Mo. 1876) (discussing Missouri statute defining first degree burglary as the\nbreaking into a dwelling house with the intent to commit a felony with, inter alia, a\ndangerous weapon); Commonwealth v. Hope, 39 Mass. 1, 9-10, 22 Pick. 1 (Mass. 1839)\n(discussing 1805 Massachusetts statute dividing the offense of burglary and explaining\nthat the use of a dangerous weapon during a nighttime burglary was punishable by\ndeath); United States v. Bernard, 24 F. Cas. 1131, 1131, 2 Wheeler C.C. XLIV (N.J.\n1819) (stating that New Jersey’s prohibition on the use of a dangerous weapon to rob a\npostal carrier was a capital offense).\n\n        Consistent with the historical understanding of the right to keep and bear arms,\nseveral courts, including the Supreme Court in Heller, have recognized that the right to\nkeep and bear arms is for lawful purposes. See Heller, 554 U.S. at 625 (reading the\nMiller decision as providing that the “the Second Amendment does not protect those\nweapons not typically possessed by law-abiding citizens for lawful purposes”); Huntly,\n3 Ired. at 423 (discussing common law offense of “riding or going about armed with\nunusual and dangerous weapons” and stating that “[f]or any lawful purpose--either of\nbusiness or amusement-- the citizen is at perfect liberty to carry his gun. It is the wicked\npurpose-- and the mischievous result--which essentially constitute the crime”); see\ngenerally Andrews v. State, 50 Tenn. 165, 196 (Tenn. 1871) (Nelson, J., concurring)\n\fNo. 10-6279           United States v. Greeno                                                 Page 14\n\n\n(“Neither the old nor the new Constitution confers the right to keep, or to bear, or to\nwear arms, for the purpose of aggression.”).\n\n         By penalizing weapon possession during a drug offense, the Section 2D1.1(b)(1)\nenhancement is consistent with the historical understanding of the right to keep and bear\narms, which did not extend to possession of weapons for unlawful purposes. To hold the\ncontrary would suggest that the Second Amendment protects an individual’s right to\npossess a weapon for criminal purposes. Nothing in Heller, the common law, or early\ncase law suggests such a reading.\n\n         The Section 2D1.1(b)(1) enhancement, like other historical restrictions on the\npossession and use of weapons, punishes an individual who possesses a dangerous\nweapon for an unlawful purpose and, thus, it falls outside the scope of the Second\nAmendment right. The enhancement “reflects the increased danger of violence when\ndrug traffickers possess weapons.” Sentencing Guidelines § 2D1.1(b)(1) cmt. n.3(A).\nGreeno did not rebut the presumption that the firearms were connected to his drug\ntrafficking offense; he did not establish he possessed the firearms for a lawful purpose.\n\n         Because the conduct regulated by the Section 2D1.1(b)(1) enhancement falls\noutside the scope of the Second Amendment right as historically understood, Greeno’s\nSecond Amendment challenge fails.2\n\n                                                  c.\n\n         At least one circuit court has suggested that even if the regulated activity\npresumably falls outside the scope of the Second Amendment right, a regulation may\nstill be subject to an as-applied challenge. See United States v. Barton, 633 F.3d 168,\n172-73 (3d Cir. 2011) (explaining that “Heller’s statement regarding the presumptive\nvalidity of felon gun dispossession statutes does not foreclose Barton’s as-applied\n\n\n\n\n         2\n          Since Greeno’s challenge does not survive the first prong of the two-pronged approach, we need\nnot decide the appropriate level of scrutiny to apply to post-Heller Second Amendment challenges under\nthe second prong.\n\fNo. 10-6279        United States v. Greeno                                      Page 15\n\n\nchallenge” because by describing the statute as “presumptively” lawful, “the Supreme\nCourt implied that the presumption may be rebutted”).\n\n       To the extent Greeno raises such a challenge, it fails. Greeno has not cited any\nauthority suggesting that the enhancement as applied to him is an unacceptable\nrestriction on his Second Amendment right or that he falls outside the intended scope of\nthe enhancement. As we previously discussed in Section II.A., the Government\npresented evidence showing that officers found three firearms in Greeno’s home in\nrelatively close proximity to drugs and drug paraphernalia and within days of a\ncontrolled purchase of methamphetamine at Greeno’s home. The district court relied on\nthis evidence to conclude that the Government met its burden of showing that Greeno\npossessed a firearm in connection with his drug offense. Greeno did not present any\nevidence to the district court showing that he used the firearms for a lawful purpose or\nthat the connection between the firearms and the drug offense was clearly improbable.\n\n                                          III.\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we affirm.\n\f",

Dupree, Chattanooga, Tennessee, for Appellant. Terra L. Bay, Assistant United States Attorney, Chattanooga, Tennessee, Luke A. McLaurin, Assistant United States Attorney, Knoxville, Tennessee, for Appellee.</p>\n<p>Before: MOORE, GIBBONS, and ALARCÓN, Circuit Judges.<sup>[*]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>OPINION</h2>\n<p>ALARCÓN, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>Defendant-appellant Mark Greeno appeals from the district court's judgment sentencing him to 87 months in prison for conspiracy with intent to distribute methamphetamine in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a) and (b)(1)(A). Greeno contends that the district court erred when it applied a dangerous weapon enhancement to his sentence, pursuant to Section 2D1.1(b)(1) of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines. Greeno also asserts that application of the Section 2D1.1(b)(1) dangerous weapon enhancement violated his Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the district court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*513</span> I.</h2>\n<p>In May 2009, as part of an ongoing investigation of a methamphetamine trafficking conspiracy in Tennessee and Georgia, law enforcement officers conducted two controlled purchases of methamphetamine at Greeno's property. Within three days of the second controlled purchase, Officers Eric Allman, Toby Norris, and Dax McGowan executed a search warrant on Greeno's property, which contained a house, a recreational vehicle (\"RV\"), and a garage.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>Officer Norris found a five-shot revolver between the bed and wall of Greeno's RV. The revolver was near drug paraphernalia, including black electrical tape that was similar to the packaging used on methamphetamine purchased by officers in other controlled purchases. Officer McGowan searched Greeno's garage and found a handgun in the laundry room. He also found an unloaded rifle and ammunition in a nearby tool room. A few yards outside the garage, officers found a canister of methamphetamine buried in the ground. Officers also found a smaller package of methamphetamine wrapped in black electrical tape outside Greeno's RV.</p>\n<p>In January 2010, the Government charged Greeno, along with twenty-three other individuals, with, <i>inter alia,</i> conspiracy to distribute at least fifty grams of methamphetamine or at least five hundred grams of a mixture and substance containing methamphetamine in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a) and (b)(1)(A). A few months later, Greeno pleaded guilty to the conspiracy charge pursuant to a written plea agreement. The district court dismissed the remaining count against Greeno pursuant to the plea agreement.</p>\n<p>At Greeno's sentencing hearing, the district court adopted the presentence investigation report and applied the advisory Sentencing Guidelines in determining his sentence. The district court applied a two-level enhancement to Greeno's offense level for possession of a dangerous weapon during a drug offense, pursuant to Section 2D1.1(b)(1) of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines. The application of this enhancement resulted in an overall offense level of 29, which increased his advisory Guidelines range from 70 to 87 months in prison to 87 to 108 months in prison.</p>\n<p>At the sentencing hearing, Greeno objected to the application of the Section 2D1.1(b)(1) dangerous weapon enhancement. He argued that there was insufficient evidence connecting the firearms found on his property with his drug trafficking offense. He also contended that the firearms were for personal protection. In response, the Government presented testimony from Officers Allman, Norris, and McGowan regarding their search of Greeno's property and the controlled methamphetamine purchases conducted at Greeno's home. Greeno's counsel cross-examined the officers, but did not present any evidence at the sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p>The district court concluded that the Government had met its burden of showing that Greeno possessed a dangerous weapon during his drug trafficking offense and that Greeno had failed to produce any evidence demonstrating that it was clearly improbable that the weapon was connected to his offense. Thus, the court overruled Greeno's objection to the Section 2D1.1(b)(1) dangerous weapon enhancement and sentenced him to 87 months in prison.</p>\n<p>Greeno filed a timely notice of appeal on October 19, 2010, following entry of judgment on October 14, 2010. The district court had jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*514</span> § 3231. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>Greeno contends in this appeal that the district court erred by applying the Section 2D1.1(b)(1) dangerous weapon enhancement to his sentence because the Government did not present sufficient evidence to show that Greeno possessed a firearm in connection with his drug trafficking offense. He also maintains that the application of this enhancement violates his Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. This Circuit reviews a district court's interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines <i>de novo</i> and its \"findings of fact at sentencing for clear error.\" <i>United States v. Baker,</i> 559 F.3d 443, 448 (6th Cir. 2009).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A.</h2>\n<p>Pursuant to Section 2D1.1(b)(1), a two-level enhancement may be added to the base offense level of a defendant convicted of a drug offense \"[i]f a dangerous weapon (including a firearm) was possessed.\" U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual § 2D1.1(b)(1) [hereinafter Sentencing Guidelines]. \"The enhancement should be applied if the weapon was present, unless it is clearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense.\" <i>Id.</i> § 2D1.1 cmt. n.3(A).</p>\n<p>Under Section 2D1.1(b)(1), the government has the burden of showing \"by a preponderance of the evidence that `(1) the defendant actually or constructively \"possessed\" the weapon, and (2) such possession was during the commission of the offense.'\" <i>United States v. Catalan,</i> 499 F.3d 604, 606 (6th Cir. 2007) (quoting <i>United States v. Hill,</i> 79 F.3d 1477, 1485 (6th Cir. 1996)). This Court has previously recognized that the 1991 amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines removed the requirement that the weapon be possessed <i>during the commission of the crime. </i><i>United States v. Faison,</i> 339 F.3d 518, 520 (6th Cir. 2003). \"[A]ll that the government need show is that the dangerous weapon [was] possessed during `relevant conduct.'\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>This Court has also recognized that although the Government's burden contains \"two separate inquiries, in most instances they collapse into a single factual determination because the weapon was present when the arrest took place or where the crime was committed.\" <i>United States v. Sanchez,</i> 928 F.2d 1450, 1460 (6th Cir. 1991), <i>abrogated on other grounds by </i><i>United States v. Jackson-Randolph,</i> 282 F.3d 369 (6th Cir. 2002). In such \"instances, once the government proves a defendant was in possession of a weapon, its burden is satisfied.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Once the government meets its burden, \"a [rebuttable] presumption arises that `the weapon was connected to the offense.'\" <i>United States v. Wheaton,</i> 517 F.3d 350, 367 (6th Cir. 2008) (quoting <i>United States v. Hough,</i> 276 F.3d 884, 894 (6th Cir. 2002)). The burden then \"shifts to the defendant to show that it was `clearly improbable' that the weapon was connected to the offense.\" <i>Catalan,</i> 499 F.3d at 606. A defendant must present evidence, not mere argument, in order to meet his or her burden. <i>See </i><i>Hough,</i> 276 F.3d at 894 (\"[S]peculation is not evidence and does not establish that it was `clearly improbable' that [the defendant] possessed the firearms during the offense.\"); <i>see also </i><i>Wheaton,</i> 517 F.3d at 368 (\"The bare assertion of Wheaton's counsel that the gun might simply have been for the lawful purpose of defending the residence is insufficient to sustain Wheaton's burden of showing it was `clearly improbable' that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*515</span> the gun was related to the drug conspiracy.\").</p>\n<p>This Court considers the following factors, none of which is alone controlling, when determining whether the application of a Section 2D1.1(b)(1) enhancement was appropriate:</p>\n<blockquote>(1) the type of firearm involved; (2) the accessibility of the weapon to the defendant; (3) the presence of ammunition; (4) the proximity of the weapon to illicit drugs, proceeds, or paraphernalia; (5) the defendant's evidence concerning the use of the weapon; and (6) whether the defendant was actually engaged in drug-trafficking, rather than mere manufacturing or possession.</blockquote>\n<p><i>United States v. Edmonds,</i> 9 Fed.Appx. 330, 332 (6th Cir. 2001) (citing <i>United States v. Calhoun,</i> 49 F.3d 231, 237 (6th Cir. 1995); <i>United States v. Chalkias,</i> 971 F.2d 1206, 1217 (6th Cir. 1992); <i>United States v. McGhee,</i> 882 F.2d 1095, 1099 (6th Cir. 1989)).</p>\n<p>The district court did not err in concluding that the Government presented sufficient evidence to meet its burden. The search was conducted only a few days after the controlled purchase of methamphetamine at Greeno's property. The firearms were found throughout the property in relatively close proximity to drugs and drug paraphernalia. Thus, regardless of where Greeno was on the property, he had ready access to the firearms. Greeno does not dispute that he possessed the firearms, nor that the firearms were found on his property during the existence of the drug conspiracy.</p>\n<p>Greeno nonetheless contends that the district court erred by applying the Section 2D1.1(b)(1) enhancement because there was no direct evidence showing he possessed a firearm when he sold drugs or that the firearms were found with drugs or drug paraphernalia. Greeno relies on <i>United States v. Jock,</i> 239 Fed.Appx. 126 (6th Cir. 2007), <i>Baker,</i> 559 F.3d 443, <i>United States v. Woods,</i> 604 F.3d 286 (6th Cir. 2010), and <i>United States v. Wright,</i> 426 Fed.Appx. 412 (6th Cir. 2011), to support this contention.</p>\n<p>Greeno's reliance on <i>Jock</i> is misplaced. Greeno referred to docket number 06-5595 in citing <i>Jock.</i> That docket number is associated with a Sixth Circuit decision affirming the defendant's resentencing after an earlier remand in 2005. <i>Jock,</i> 239 Fed.Appx. at 127. To the extent Greeno intended to cite the 2005 decision in <i>United States v. Jock,</i> 148 Fed.Appx. 519 (6th Cir. 2005), that decision reversed the district court's sentence because the district court treated the Guidelines as mandatory in violation of <i>United States v. Booker,</i> 543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <i>Jock,</i> 148 Fed.Appx. at 523-24. Greeno does not contend there was a <i>Booker</i> error in this case.</p>\n<p>Greeno's reliance on <i>Baker</i> and <i>Wright</i> is also misplaced. Neither case involves a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the application of a Section 2D1.1(b)(1) enhancement. The <i>Baker</i> case involves a challenge to a career offender enhancement. <i>Baker,</i> 559 F.3d at 450, 453. The <i>Wright</i> case involves a challenge to the district court's consideration of uncharged crimes when determining a defendant's sentence. <i>Wright,</i> 426 Fed.Appx. at 415-16. While both decisions reversed and remanded for resentencing, Greeno has not pointed to any portion of either of these decisions that supports his argument in this appeal.</p>\n<p>Greeno's reliance on <i>Woods</i> is also misplaced. While the court in <i>Woods</i> reversed the district court's application of a Section 2D1.1(b)(1) enhancement, the enhancement was based on possession of a firearm by a co-conspirator. <i>Woods,</i> 604 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*516</span> F.3d at 290-92. The district court's application of the Section 2D1.1(b)(1) enhancement in this case was not based on possession of a firearm by a co-conspirator.</p>\n<p>Greeno did not offer any evidence demonstrating that it was clearly improbable that the firearms were connected to his drug offense and, thus, did not meet his burden. If a defendant fails to meet his or her burden of showing that it was clearly improbable that a firearm was connected to a drug offense, \"the district court should apply the enhancement.\" <i>Catalan,</i> 499 F.3d at 606-07. Because Greeno did not meet his burden, the district court did not err when it applied the Section 2D1.1(b)(1) dangerous weapon enhancement to Greeno's sentence.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B.</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1.</h2>\n<p>Although Greeno's articulation of his Second Amendment challenge in his brief is somewhat conclusory and unclear, contrary to the Government's contentions, he did not waive it. This Circuit has recognized that even a \"bare bones\" argument may survive a waiver challenge. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Erpenbeck,</i> 532 F.3d 423, 434 (6th Cir. 2008) (concluding that a \"bare bones\" argument raised in a footnote \"is not so undeveloped as to constitute a waiver\"). Greeno identified the Second Amendment issue in his brief under the header \"Issues Presented for Appeal.\" Greeno also addressed his Second Amendment challenge on pages 12 and 13 of his brief. Moreover, Greeno cited and relied on Supreme Court decisions in <i>District of Columbia v. Heller,</i> 554 U.S. 570, 128 S.Ct. 2783, 171 L.Ed.2d 637 (2008), and <i>McDonald v. City of Chicago,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 130 S.Ct. 3020, 177 L.Ed.2d 894 (2010), in support of his challenge.</p>\n<p>Greeno's Second Amendment challenge, however, is subject to plain error review because he did not raise it in the district court. A defendant who fails to present an issue to the district court forfeits the benefit of full review, such that appellate review is limited to determining whether the district court committed plain error. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Skipper,</i> 552 F.3d 489, 491 (6th Cir. 2009) (\"Skipper did not present this argument to the district court, so our review is limited to determining whether the district court committed plain error.\").</p>\n<p>Greeno has not cited any portion of the record showing that he raised his Second Amendment challenge in the district court. Based on our review of the transcript from the sentencing hearing, Greeno's counsel referred to the Second Amendment only once: during cross-examination of Officer McGowan. Defense counsel asked Officer McGowan if Greeno \"had a good Second Amendment right to own weapons?\" to which the officer responded \"[y]eah.\" R. 628 at 49-50. This single question is not enough to raise his Second Amendment challenge because it does not establish a detailed record for review on appeal. Thus, we review for plain error.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2.</h2>\n<p>On plain error review, we must first determine \"whether an error occurred in the district court.\" <i>United States v. Thomas,</i> 11 F.3d 620, 630 (6th Cir. 1993). If we conclude that no error occurred, the \"inquiry is at an end.\" <i>Id.</i> In order to determine if an error occurred in the district court in this case, we must determine whether Greeno's Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms, as recognized in <i>Heller,</i> was impermissibly restricted by application of the Section 2D1.1(b)(1) enhancement.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*517</span> a.</h2>\n<p>The Second Amendment provides: \"A well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\" U.S. Const. amend. II. The Supreme Court held in <i>Heller</i> that the Second Amendment protects an individual's right to keep and bear arms without regard to Militia service. <i>Heller,</i> 554 U.S. at 595, 598-99, 128 S.Ct. 2783. The Court held that the Second Amendment codified the pre-existing right to keep and bear arms. <i>See id.</i> at 592, 128 S.Ct. 2783 (explaining that \"it has always been widely understood that the Second Amendment, like the First and Fourth Amendments, codified a <i>pre-existing</i> right\"). The core right recognized in <i>Heller</i> is \"the right of law-abiding, responsible citizens to use arms in defense of hearth and home.\" <i>Id.</i> at 635, 128 S.Ct. 2783.</p>\n<p>The Court, however, recognized that the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms \"is not unlimited.\" <i>Id.</i> at 626, 128 S.Ct. 2783. For example, the Court recognized the \"historical tradition of prohibiting the carrying of dangerous and unusual weapons.\" <i>Id.</i> at 627, 128 S.Ct. 2783 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Court read its prior decision in <i>United States v. Miller,</i> 307 U.S. 174, 59 S.Ct. 816, 83 L.Ed. 1206 (1939) \"to say only that the Second Amendment does not protect those weapons not typically possessed by law-abiding citizens for lawful purposes, such as short-barreled shotguns.\" <i>Heller,</i> 554 U.S. at 625, 128 S.Ct. 2783.</p>\n<p>The Court also recognized that \"[f]rom Blackstone through the 19th-century cases, commentators and courts routinely explained that the right was not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose.\" <i>Id.</i> at 626, 128 S.Ct. 2783. The Court declined to define the full scope of the Second Amendment right, but did articulate a non-exhaustive list of presumptively lawful regulations:</p>\n<blockquote>[N]othing in [the] opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 626-27, 627 n. 26, 128 S.Ct. 2783.</p>\n<p>Because the list contains the prohibition on the possession of firearms by felons, this Circuit has relied on it to reject Second Amendment challenges to federal felon-in-possession of a firearm convictions and related expungement exceptions. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Carey,</i> 602 F.3d 738, 741 (6th Cir. 2010) (\"In short, <i>Heller</i> states that the Second Amendment right is not unlimited, and in fact, it is specifically <i>limited</i> in the case of felon prohibitions. Because Congress's prohibition on felon possession of firearms is constitutional, it follows that the burdens associated with the congressionally-created expungement exception in 18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(20) do not violate the Second Amendment.\" (citation omitted)); <i>United States v. Whisnant,</i> 391 Fed.Appx. 426, 430 (6th Cir. 2010) (relying on <i>Carey</i> and rejecting Second Amendment challenge to felon in possession of firearm conviction).</p>\n<p>Because the list does not contain the Section 2D1.1(b)(1) dangerous weapon enhancement at issue in this case, we cannot rely on the list, alone, to reject Greeno's Second Amendment challenge. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Chester,</i> 628 F.3d 673, 679 (4th Cir. 2010) (\"Some courts have treated <i>Heller</i>'s listing of `presumptively lawful regulatory measures,' for all practical purposes, as a kind of `safe harbor' for unlisted regulatory measures, such as 18 U.S.C. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*518</span> § 922(g)(9), which they deem to be analogous to those measures specifically listed in <i>Heller</i> ... This approach, however, approximates rational-basis review, which has been rejected by <i>Heller.</i>\" (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p>This Circuit has not yet reached the merits of a post-<i>Heller</i> Second Amendment challenge to a Section 2D1.1(b)(1) dangerous weapon enhancement in a published decision. <i>See United States v. Walker,</i> 351 Fed.Appx. 16, 18 (6th Cir. 2009) (declining to reach the merits of the defendant's post-<i>Heller</i> Second Amendment challenge to a Section 2D1.1(b)(1) enhancement because the defendant waived the challenge by accepting the enhancement in his plea agreement); <i>United States v. Hurley,</i> 278 Fed.Appx. 574, 576 (6th Cir. 2008) (declining to reach the merits of the defendant's post-<i>Heller</i> Second Amendment challenge to a Section 2D1.1(b)(1) enhancement because the defendant waived the challenge by failing to develop the argument in his brief).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>b.</h2>\n<p>Since the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Heller,</i> courts have wrestled with its text to develop a sound approach to resolving Second Amendment challenges. Several circuits have adopted a two-pronged approach. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Marzzarella,</i> 614 F.3d 85, 89 (3d Cir. 2010) (\"As we read <i>Heller,</i> it suggests a two-pronged approach to Second Amendment challenges.\"); <i>Chester,</i> 628 F.3d at 680 (applying two-pronged approach); <i>Ezell v. City of Chicago,</i> 651 F.3d 684, 701-03 (7th Cir. 2011) (same); <i>United States v. Reese,</i> 627 F.3d 792, 800-01 (10th Cir. 2010) (same).</p>\n<p>Under the first prong, the court asks whether the challenged law burdens conduct that falls within the scope of the Second Amendment right, as historically understood. <i>Chester,</i> 628 F.3d at 680. As the Seventh Circuit recognized, \"<i>Heller</i> suggests that some federal gun laws will survive Second Amendment challenge because they regulate activity falling outside the terms of the right as publicly understood when the Bill of Rights was ratified.\" <i>Ezell,</i> 651 F.3d at 702. If the Government demonstrates that the challenged statute \"regulates activity falling outside the scope of the Second Amendment right as it was understood at the relevant historical moment1791 [Bill of Rights ratification] or 1868 [Fourteenth Amendment ratification]then the analysis can stop there; the regulated activity is categorically unprotected, and the law is not subject to further Second Amendment review.\" <i>Id.</i> at 702-03.</p>\n<p>\"If the government cannot establish thisif the historical evidence is inconclusive or suggests that the regulated activity is <i>not</i> categorically unprotectedthen there must be a second inquiry into the strength of the government's justification for restricting or regulating the exercise of Second Amendment rights.\" <i>Id.</i> at 703. Under this prong, the court applies the appropriate level of scrutiny. <i>Marzzarella,</i> 614 F.3d at 89. If the law satisfies the applicable standard, it is constitutional. <i>Id.</i> If it does not, \"it is invalid.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>We find this two-pronged approach appropriate and, thus, adopt it in this Circuit. Under the first prong, we must determine whether the Section 2D1.1(b)(1) enhancement burdens conduct that falls within the scope of the Second Amendment right as historically understood. If the enhancement falls outside the scope of the Second Amendment right as historically understood, the possession of a weapon during a drug offense is unprotected and our inquiry ends.</p>\n<p>According to <i>Heller,</i> the Second Amendment right as historically understood protects <span class=\"star-pagination\">*519</span> the right of individuals to keep and bear arms for self-defense. <i>Heller,</i> 554 U.S. at 628, 128 S.Ct. 2783. As stated above, the core right recognized in <i>Heller</i> is \"the right of law-abiding, responsible citizens to use arms in defense of hearth and home.\" <i>Id.</i> at 635, 128 S.Ct. 2783. Since the Second Amendment recognized the pre-existing right to keep and bear arms, we look to early restrictions on the possession and use of weapons.</p>\n<p>As a preliminary matter, we acknowledge that the Section 2D1.1(b)(1) enhancement, as well as laws prohibiting the possession, use, and distribution of narcotics are of relatively recent vintage. The Section 2D1.1(b)(1) enhancement was first introduced in 1987. Sentencing Guidelines § 2D1.1(b)(1) (1987). State laws prohibiting the sale of certain narcotics were first introduced in the late Nineteenth Century. <i>See</i> Margarita Mercado Echegaray, <i>Drug Prohibition in America: Federal Drug Policy and its Consequences,</i> 75 Rev. Jur. U.P.R. 1215, 1219 (2006) (\"In light of widespread use during the nineteenth century, states enacted legislation to curb drug use in America.\"); <i>see, e.g., In re Ah Lung,</i> 45 F. 684, 685 (C.C.N.D.Cal. 1891) (discussing San Francisco city ordinance prohibiting sale, gift, or delivery of opium or morphine); <i>Luck v. Sears,</i> 29 Or. 421, 423, 44 P. 693 (Or. 1896) (discussing 1887 state statute prohibiting the sale and gift of opium, morphine, and other substances). While earlier federal drug-related laws involved labeling and taxation, the first comprehensive federal drug law targeting drug trafficking was enacted in 1970 in the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, Pub.L. No. 91-513, 84 Stat. 1236. <i>See </i><i>Gonzales v. Raich,</i> 545 U.S. 1, 10, 125 S.Ct. 2195, 162 L.Ed.2d 1 (2005) (discussing federal drug regulations).</p>\n<p>The mere fact that drug laws and the Section 2D1.1(b)(1) enhancement were not enacted until recently does not automatically render the possession of weapons by drug traffickers within the scope of the Second Amendment right as historically understood. Nothing in <i>Heller</i> suggests such a static reading of the Second Amendment. Thus, we look to the broader question of whether the Second Amendment right, as historically understood, protected the possession of weapons by individuals engaged in criminal activity.</p>\n<p>At common law, the right to keep and bear arms was not unlimited. For example, there was a historical tradition prohibiting the possession of dangerous or unusual weapons. <i>Heller,</i> 554 U.S. at 627, 128 S.Ct. 2783; <i>see </i><i>State v. Hirsch,</i> 338 Or. 622, 676, 114 P.3d 1104 (Or. 2005) (discussing common law right to keep and bear arms and that \"[n]othing in the history of the English right suggests that the drafters of the English Bill of Rights intended the arms provision to preclude the disarmament of serious lawbreakers\"); <i>see, e.g., </i><i>State v. Huntly,</i> 25 N.C. 418, 3 Ired. 418, 418 (1843) (discussing the common law history of the offense of riding or going armed with dangerous or unusual weapons, to the terror of the people).</p>\n<p>In the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries, numerous states separately penalized, or increased the severity of punishment for, crimes committed by individuals who used a weapon during the commission of a crime. <i>See</i> Saul Cornell &amp; Nathan DeDino, <i>A Well Regulated Right: The Early American Origins of Gun Control,</i> 73 Fordham L.Rev. 487, 501 (2004) (discussing history of right to keep and bear arms and explaining that, in the Founding Era, \"justices of the peace, sheriffs, and constables were empowered to disarm individuals who ride about armed in terror of the peace\"); <i>see, e.g., </i><i>State v. O'Neil,</i> 71 Minn. 399, 401, 73 N.W. 1091 (Minn. 1898) (discussing Minnesota statute that classified <span class=\"star-pagination\">*520</span> a robbery committed by a person armed with a dangerous weapon as first degree robbery); <i>People v.

Cash,</i> 38 Kan. 50, 16 P. 144, 145 (1887) (discussing Kansas statute characterizing first degree burglary as committed by a person who, <i>inter alia,</i> is armed with a dangerous weapon); <i>State v. Tutt,</i> 63 Mo. 595, 599 (Mo. 1876) (discussing Missouri statute defining first degree burglary as the breaking into a dwelling house with the intent to commit a felony with, <i>inter alia,</i> a dangerous weapon); <i>Commonwealth v. Hope,</i> 39 Mass. 1, 9-10, 22 Pick. 1 (Mass. 1839) (discussing 1805 Massachusetts statute dividing the offense of burglary and explaining that the use of a dangerous weapon during a nighttime burglary was punishable by death); <i>United States v. Bernard,</i> 24 F. Cas. 1131, 1131, 2 Wheeler C.C. XLIV (C.C.D.N.J. 1819) (stating that New Jersey's prohibition on the use of a dangerous weapon to rob a postal carrier was a capital offense).</p>\n<p>Consistent with the historical understanding of the right to keep and bear arms, several courts, including the Supreme Court in <i>Heller,</i> have recognized that the right to keep and bear arms is for <i>lawful purposes. See </i><i>Heller,</i> 554 U.S. at 625, 128 S.Ct. 2783 (reading the <i>Miller</i> decision as providing that the \"the Second Amendment does not protect those weapons not typically possessed by law-abiding citizens for lawful purposes\"); <i>Huntly,</i> 3 Ired. at 423 (discussing common law offense of \"riding or going about armed with unusual and dangerous weapons\" and stating that \"[f]or any lawful purposeeither of business or amusementthe citizen is at perfect liberty to carry his gun. It is the wicked purposeand the mischievous resultwhich essentially constitute the crime\"); <i>see generally </i><i>Andrews v. State,</i> 50 Tenn. 165, 196 (Tenn. 1871) (Nelson, J., concurring) (\"Neither the old nor the new Constitution confers the right to keep, or to bear, or to wear arms, for the purpose of aggression.\").</p>\n<p>By penalizing weapon possession during a drug offense, the Section 2D1.1(b)(1) enhancement is consistent with the historical understanding of the right to keep and bear arms, which did not extend to possession of weapons for unlawful purposes. To hold the contrary would suggest that the Second Amendment protects an individual's right to possess a weapon for criminal purposes. Nothing in <i>Heller,</i> the common law, or early case law suggests such a reading.</p>\n<p>The Section 2D1.1(b)(1) enhancement, like other historical restrictions on the possession and use of weapons, punishes an individual who possesses a dangerous weapon for an unlawful purpose and, thus, it falls outside the scope of the Second Amendment right. The enhancement \"reflects the increased danger of violence when drug traffickers possess weapons.\" Sentencing Guidelines § 2D1.1(b)(1) cmt. n.3(A). Greeno did not rebut the presumption that the firearms were connected to his drug trafficking offense; he did not establish he possessed the firearms for a lawful purpose.</p>\n<p>Because the conduct regulated by the Section 2D1.1(b)(1) enhancement falls outside the scope of the Second Amendment right as historically understood, Greeno's Second Amendment challenge fails.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>c.</h2>\n<p>At least one circuit court has suggested that even if the regulated activity presumably <span class=\"star-pagination\">*521</span> falls outside the scope of the Second Amendment right, a regulation may still be subject to an as-applied challenge. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Barton,</i> 633 F.3d 168, 172-73 (3d Cir.2011) (explaining that \"<i>Heller</i>'s statement regarding the presumptive validity of felon gun dispossession statutes does not foreclose Barton's as-applied challenge\" because by describing the statute as \"presumptively\" lawful, \"the Supreme Court implied that the presumption may be rebutted\").</p>\n<p>To the extent Greeno raises such a challenge, it fails. Greeno has not cited any authority suggesting that the enhancement as applied to him is an unacceptable restriction on his Second Amendment right or that he falls outside the intended scope of the enhancement. As we previously discussed in Section II.A., the Government presented evidence showing that officers found three firearms in Greeno's home in relatively close proximity to drugs and drug paraphernalia and within days of a controlled purchase of methamphetamine at Greeno's home. The district court relied on this evidence to conclude that the Government met its burden of showing that Greeno possessed a firearm in connection with his drug offense. Greeno did not present any evidence to the district court showing that he used the firearms for a lawful purpose or that the connection between the firearms and the drug offense was clearly improbable.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  The Honorable Arthur L.

McLaurin, Assistant United States Attorney, Knoxville, Tennessee, for Appellee.</p>\n<p>Before: MOORE, GIBBONS, and ALARCÓN, Circuit Judges.<sup>[*]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>OPINION</h2>\n<p>ALARCÓN, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>Defendant-appellant Mark Greeno appeals from the district court's judgment sentencing him to 87 months in prison for conspiracy with intent to distribute methamphetamine in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a) and (b)(1)(A). Greeno contends that the district court erred when it applied a dangerous weapon enhancement to his sentence, pursuant to Section 2D1.1(b)(1) of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines. Greeno also asserts that application of the Section 2D1.1(b)(1) dangerous weapon enhancement violated his Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the district court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*513</span> I.</h2>\n<p>In May 2009, as part of an ongoing investigation of a methamphetamine trafficking conspiracy in Tennessee and Georgia, law enforcement officers conducted two controlled purchases of methamphetamine at Greeno's property. Within three days of the second controlled purchase, Officers Eric Allman, Toby Norris, and Dax McGowan executed a search warrant on Greeno's property, which contained a house, a recreational vehicle (\"RV\"), and a garage.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>Officer Norris found a five-shot revolver between the bed and wall of Greeno's RV. The revolver was near drug paraphernalia, including black electrical tape that was similar to the packaging used on methamphetamine purchased by officers in other controlled purchases. Officer McGowan searched Greeno's garage and found a handgun in the laundry room. He also found an unloaded rifle and ammunition in a nearby tool room. A few yards outside the garage, officers found a canister of methamphetamine buried in the ground. Officers also found a smaller package of methamphetamine wrapped in black electrical tape outside Greeno's RV.</p>\n<p>In January 2010, the Government charged Greeno, along with twenty-three other individuals, with, <i>inter alia,</i> conspiracy to distribute at least fifty grams of methamphetamine or at least five hundred grams of a mixture and substance containing methamphetamine in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a) and (b)(1)(A). A few months later, Greeno pleaded guilty to the conspiracy charge pursuant to a written plea agreement. The district court dismissed the remaining count against Greeno pursuant to the plea agreement.</p>\n<p>At Greeno's sentencing hearing, the district court adopted the presentence investigation report and applied the advisory Sentencing Guidelines in determining his sentence. The district court applied a two-level enhancement to Greeno's offense level for possession of a dangerous weapon during a drug offense, pursuant to Section 2D1.1(b)(1) of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines. The application of this enhancement resulted in an overall offense level of 29, which increased his advisory Guidelines range from 70 to 87 months in prison to 87 to 108 months in prison.</p>\n<p>At the sentencing hearing, Greeno objected to the application of the Section 2D1.1(b)(1) dangerous weapon enhancement. He argued that there was insufficient evidence connecting the firearms found on his property with his drug trafficking offense. He also contended that the firearms were for personal protection. In response, the Government presented testimony from Officers Allman, Norris, and McGowan regarding their search of Greeno's property and the controlled methamphetamine purchases conducted at Greeno's home. Greeno's counsel cross-examined the officers, but did not present any evidence at the sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p>The district court concluded that the Government had met its burden of showing that Greeno possessed a dangerous weapon during his drug trafficking offense and that Greeno had failed to produce any evidence demonstrating that it was clearly improbable that the weapon was connected to his offense. Thus, the court overruled Greeno's objection to the Section 2D1.1(b)(1) dangerous weapon enhancement and sentenced him to 87 months in prison.</p>\n<p>Greeno filed a timely notice of appeal on October 19, 2010, following entry of judgment on October 14, 2010. The district court had jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*514</span> § 3231. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>Greeno contends in this appeal that the district court erred by applying the Section 2D1.1(b)(1) dangerous weapon enhancement to his sentence because the Government did not present sufficient evidence to show that Greeno possessed a firearm in connection with his drug trafficking offense. He also maintains that the application of this enhancement violates his Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.

The search was conducted only a few days after the controlled purchase of methamphetamine at Greeno's property. The firearms were found throughout the property in relatively close proximity to drugs and drug paraphernalia. Thus, regardless of where Greeno was on the property, he had ready access to the firearms. Greeno does not dispute that he possessed the firearms, nor that the firearms were found on his property during the existence of the drug conspiracy.</p>\n<p>Greeno nonetheless contends that the district court erred by applying the Section 2D1.1(b)(1) enhancement because there was no direct evidence showing he possessed a firearm when he sold drugs or that the firearms were found with drugs or drug paraphernalia. Greeno relies on <i>United States v. Jock,</i> 239 Fed.Appx. 126 (6th Cir. 2007), <i>Baker,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1388240\"><a href=\"/opinion/1388240/united-states-v-baker/\"><span class=\"volume\">559</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">443</span></a></span>, <i>United States v.

Wright,</i> 426 Fed.Appx. 412 (6th Cir. 2011), to support this contention.</p>\n<p>Greeno's reliance on <i>Jock</i> is misplaced. Greeno referred to docket number 06-5595 in citing <i>Jock.</i> That docket number is associated with a Sixth Circuit decision affirming the defendant's resentencing after an earlier remand in 2005. <i>Jock,</i> 239 Fed.Appx. at 127. To the extent Greeno intended to cite the 2005 decision in <i>United States v. Jock,</i> 148 Fed.Appx. 519 (6th Cir. 2005), that decision reversed the district court's sentence because the district court treated the Guidelines as mandatory in violation of <i>United States v.

Greeno does not contend there was a <i>Booker</i> error in this case.</p>\n<p>Greeno's reliance on <i>Baker</i> and <i>Wright</i> is also misplaced. Neither case involves a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the application of a Section 2D1.1(b)(1) enhancement. The <i>Baker</i> case involves a challenge to a career offender enhancement. <i>Baker,</i> 559 F.3d at 450, 453. The <i>Wright</i> case involves a challenge to the district court's consideration of uncharged crimes when determining a defendant's sentence. <i>Wright,</i> 426 Fed.Appx. at 415-16. While both decisions reversed and remanded for resentencing, Greeno has not pointed to any portion of either of these decisions that supports his argument in this appeal.</p>\n<p>Greeno's reliance on <i>Woods</i> is also misplaced. While the court in <i>Woods</i> reversed the district court's application of a Section 2D1.1(b)(1) enhancement, the enhancement was based on possession of a firearm by a co-conspirator. <i>Woods,</i> 604 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*516</span> F.3d at 290-92. The district court's application of the Section 2D1.1(b)(1) enhancement in this case was not based on possession of a firearm by a co-conspirator.</p>\n<p>Greeno did not offer any evidence demonstrating that it was clearly improbable that the firearms were connected to his drug offense and, thus, did not meet his burden. If a defendant fails to meet his or her burden of showing that it was clearly improbable that a firearm was connected to a drug offense, \"the district court should apply the enhancement.\" <i>Catalan,</i> 499 F.3d at 606-07. Because Greeno did not meet his burden, the district court did not err when it applied the Section 2D1.1(b)(1) dangerous weapon enhancement to Greeno's sentence.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B.</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1.</h2>\n<p>Although Greeno's articulation of his Second Amendment challenge in his brief is somewhat conclusory and unclear, contrary to the Government's contentions, he did not waive it. This Circuit has recognized that even a \"bare bones\" argument may survive a waiver challenge. <i>See </i><i>United States v.

Greeno identified the Second Amendment issue in his brief under the header \"Issues Presented for Appeal.\" Greeno also addressed his Second Amendment challenge on pages 12 and 13 of his brief. Moreover, Greeno cited and relied on Supreme Court decisions in <i>District of Columbia v.

A defendant who fails to present an issue to the district court forfeits the benefit of full review, such that appellate review is limited to determining whether the district court committed plain error. <i>See </i><i>United States v.

Based on our review of the transcript from the sentencing hearing, Greeno's counsel referred to the Second Amendment only once: during cross-examination of Officer McGowan. Defense counsel asked Officer McGowan if Greeno \"had a good Second Amendment right to own weapons?\" to which the officer responded \"[y]eah.\" R. 628 at 49-50. This single question is not enough to raise his Second Amendment challenge because it does not establish a detailed record for review on appeal. Thus, we review for plain error.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2.</h2>\n<p>On plain error review, we must first determine \"whether an error occurred in the district court.\" <i>United States v.

If we conclude that no error occurred, the \"inquiry is at an end.\" <i>Id.</i> In order to determine if an error occurred in the district court in this case, we must determine whether Greeno's Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms, as recognized in <i>Heller,</i> was impermissibly restricted by application of the Section 2D1.1(b)(1) enhancement.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*517</span> a.</h2>\n<p>The Second Amendment provides: \"A well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\" U.S. Const. amend.

The Court declined to define the full scope of the Second Amendment right, but did articulate a non-exhaustive list of presumptively lawful regulations:</p>\n<blockquote>[N]othing in [the] opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 626-27, 627 n. 26, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145777\"><a href=\"/opinion/145777/district-of-columbia-v-heller/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Several circuits have adopted a two-pronged approach. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Marzzarella,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"151806\"><a href=\"/opinion/151806/united-states-v-marzzarella/\"><span class=\"volume\">614</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">85</span></a></span>, 89 (3d Cir. 2010) (\"As we read <i>Heller,</i> it suggests a two-pronged approach to Second Amendment challenges.\"); <i>Chester,</i> 628 F.3d at 680 (applying two-pronged approach); <i>Ezell v.

As the Seventh Circuit recognized, \"<i>Heller</i> suggests that some federal gun laws will survive Second Amendment challenge because they regulate activity falling outside the terms of the right as publicly understood when the Bill of Rights was ratified.\" <i>Ezell,</i> 651 F.3d at 702. If the Government demonstrates that the challenged statute \"regulates activity falling outside the scope of the Second Amendment right as it was understood at the relevant historical moment1791 [Bill of Rights ratification] or 1868 [Fourteenth Amendment ratification]then the analysis can stop there; the regulated activity is categorically unprotected, and the law is not subject to further Second Amendment review.\" <i>Id.</i> at 702-03.</p>\n<p>\"If the government cannot establish thisif the historical evidence is inconclusive or suggests that the regulated activity is <i>not</i> categorically unprotectedthen there must be a second inquiry into the strength of the government's justification for restricting or regulating the exercise of Second Amendment rights.\" <i>Id.</i> at 703. Under this prong, the court applies the appropriate level of scrutiny. <i>Marzzarella,</i> 614 F.3d at 89. If the law satisfies the applicable standard, it is constitutional. <i>Id.</i> If it does not, \"it is invalid.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>We find this two-pronged approach appropriate and, thus, adopt it in this Circuit. Under the first prong, we must determine whether the Section 2D1.1(b)(1) enhancement burdens conduct that falls within the scope of the Second Amendment right as historically understood. If the enhancement falls outside the scope of the Second Amendment right as historically understood, the possession of a weapon during a drug offense is unprotected and our inquiry ends.</p>\n<p>According to <i>Heller,</i> the Second Amendment right as historically understood protects <span class=\"star-pagination\">*519</span> the right of individuals to keep and bear arms for self-defense. <i>Heller,</i> 554 U.S. at 628, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145777\"><a href=\"/opinion/145777/district-of-columbia-v-heller/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

As stated above, the core right recognized in <i>Heller</i> is \"the right of law-abiding, responsible citizens to use arms in defense of hearth and home.\" <i>Id.</i> at 635, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145777\"><a href=\"/opinion/145777/district-of-columbia-v-heller/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2783</span></a></span>. Since the Second Amendment recognized the pre-existing right to keep and bear arms, we look to early restrictions on the possession and use of weapons.</p>\n<p>As a preliminary matter, we acknowledge that the Section 2D1.1(b)(1) enhancement, as well as laws prohibiting the possession, use, and distribution of narcotics are of relatively recent vintage. The Section 2D1.1(b)(1) enhancement was first introduced in 1987. Sentencing Guidelines § 2D1.1(b)(1) (1987). State laws prohibiting the sale of certain narcotics were first introduced in the late Nineteenth Century. <i>See</i> Margarita Mercado Echegaray, <i>Drug Prohibition in America: Federal Drug Policy and its Consequences,</i> 75 Rev. Jur. U.P.R. 1215, 1219 (2006) (\"In light of widespread use during the nineteenth century, states enacted legislation to curb drug use in America.\"); <i>see, e.g., In re Ah Lung,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">45</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.</span> <span class=\"page\">684</span></span>, 685 (C.C.N.D.Cal. 1891) (discussing San Francisco city ordinance prohibiting sale, gift, or delivery of opium or morphine); <i>Luck v.

No. 91-513, 84 Stat. 1236. <i>See </i><i>Gonzales v.

Thus, we look to the broader question of whether the Second Amendment right, as historically understood, protected the possession of weapons by individuals engaged in criminal activity.</p>\n<p>At common law, the right to keep and bear arms was not unlimited.

See </i><i>Heller,</i> 554 U.S. at 625, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145777\"><a href=\"/opinion/145777/district-of-columbia-v-heller/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2783</span></a></span> (reading the <i>Miller</i> decision as providing that the \"the Second Amendment does not protect those weapons not typically possessed by law-abiding citizens for lawful purposes\"); <i>Huntly,</i> 3 Ired. at 423 (discussing common law offense of \"riding or going about armed with unusual and dangerous weapons\" and stating that \"[f]or any lawful purposeeither of business or amusementthe citizen is at perfect liberty to carry his gun. It is the wicked purposeand the mischievous resultwhich essentially constitute the crime\"); <i>see generally </i><i>Andrews v. State,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">50</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Tenn.</span> <span class=\"page\">165</span></span>, 196 (Tenn. 1871) (Nelson, J., concurring) (\"Neither the old nor the new Constitution confers the right to keep, or to bear, or to wear arms, for the purpose of aggression.\").</p>\n<p>By penalizing weapon possession during a drug offense, the Section 2D1.1(b)(1) enhancement is consistent with the historical understanding of the right to keep and bear arms, which did not extend to possession of weapons for unlawful purposes. To hold the contrary would suggest that the Second Amendment protects an individual's right to possess a weapon for criminal purposes. Nothing in <i>Heller,</i> the common law, or early case law suggests such a reading.</p>\n<p>The Section 2D1.1(b)(1) enhancement, like other historical restrictions on the possession and use of weapons, punishes an individual who possesses a dangerous weapon for an unlawful purpose and, thus, it falls outside the scope of the Second Amendment right. The enhancement \"reflects the increased danger of violence when drug traffickers possess weapons.\" Sentencing Guidelines § 2D1.1(b)(1) cmt. n.3(A). Greeno did not rebut the presumption that the firearms were connected to his drug trafficking offense; he did not establish he possessed the firearms for a lawful purpose.</p>\n<p>Because the conduct regulated by the Section 2D1.1(b)(1) enhancement falls outside the scope of the Second Amendment right as historically understood, Greeno's Second Amendment challenge fails.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>c.</h2>\n<p>At least one circuit court has suggested that even if the regulated activity presumably <span class=\"star-pagination\">*521</span> falls outside the scope of the Second Amendment right, a regulation may still be subject to an as-applied challenge. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Barton,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"205996\"><a href=\"/opinion/205996/united-states-v-barton/\"><span class=\"volume\">633</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">168</span></a></span>, 172-73 (3d Cir.2011) (explaining that \"<i>Heller</i>'s statement regarding the presumptive validity of felon gun dispossession statutes does not foreclose Barton's as-applied challenge\" because by describing the statute as \"presumptively\" lawful, \"the Supreme Court implied that the presumption may be rebutted\").</p>\n<p>To the extent Greeno raises such a challenge, it fails. Greeno has not cited any authority suggesting that the enhancement as applied to him is an unacceptable restriction on his Second Amendment right or that he falls outside the intended scope of the enhancement. As we previously discussed in Section II.A., the Government presented evidence showing that officers found three firearms in Greeno's home in relatively close proximity to drugs and drug paraphernalia and within days of a controlled purchase of methamphetamine at Greeno's home. The district court relied on this evidence to conclude that the Government met its burden of showing that Greeno possessed a firearm in connection with his drug offense. Greeno did not present any evidence to the district court showing that he used the firearms for a lawful purpose or that the connection between the firearms and the drug offense was clearly improbable.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  The Honorable Arthur L. Alarcón, Senior Circuit Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  Greeno lived in the RV during construction on the house.</p>\n<p>[2]  Since Greeno's challenge does not survive the first prong of the two-pronged approach, we need not decide the appropriate level of scrutiny to apply to post-<i>Heller</i> Second Amendment challenges under the second prong.</p>\n\n</div>",
