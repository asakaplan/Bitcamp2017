Sands, OFFICE OF THE MICHIGAN ATTORNEY GENERAL,\nLansing, Michigan, for Appellant. Mark J. Kriger, N. C. Deday LaRene, LaRENE &\nKRIGER, P.L.C., Detroit, Michigan for Appellee.\n                                       _________________\n\n                                              OPINION\n                                       _________________\n\n         McKEAGUE, Circuit Judge. While Petitioner Sandy Glover was awaiting trial\nin Livingston County Jail on various charges arising from the alleged assault of his ex-\nwife,1 he was implicated in the assault of another inmate at the jail. He was convicted\nof the jail assault in a jury trial. Glover retained trial counsel to pursue his appeal of\n\n         *\n          The Honorable Kenneth F. Ripple, Senior Circuit Judge of the United States Court of Appeals\nfor the Seventh Circuit, sitting by designation.\n         1\n          The conviction resulting from that trial was the subject of a separate habeas proceeding. Glover\nv. Palmer, No. 07-CV-11305, 2010 WL 1323570 (E.D. Mich. Mar. 29, 2010), rev’d, No. 10-1577, 2012\nWL 618209 (6th Cir. Feb. 28, 2012).\n\n\n                                                    1\n\fNo. 11-1614        Glover v. Birkett                                               Page 2\n\n\nright, but the attorney failed to timely file a notice of appeal. Glover filed a delayed\napplication for leave to appeal in the Michigan Court of Appeals, raising various\nchallenges to his conviction and sentence, which the court denied “for lack of merit in\nthe grounds presented.” The Michigan Supreme Court also denied leave to appeal.\nGlover then pursued state collateral proceedings and filed a motion for relief from\njudgment in the trial court, alleging, among other claims, that appellate counsel was\nineffective for failing to timely pursue an appeal of right. The trial court denied the\nmotion, and the Michigan Court of Appeals and Michigan Supreme Court denied\nGlover’s subsequent applications for leave to appeal the denial of his motion, for failure\nto establish entitlement to relief under Mich. Ct. Rule 6.508(D). Glover then filed the\ninstant habeas action. The district court conditionally granted his petition, finding that\ncounsel was ineffective for failing to timely pursue Glover’s appeal of right. Respondent\nBirkett appeals.\n\n       “We review the district court’s grant of a writ of habeas corpus de novo.” Jensen\nv. Romanowski, 590 F.3d 373, 377 (6th Cir. 2009). Under the Antiterrorism and\nEffective Death Penalty Act of 1996, a federal court may not grant a writ of habeas\ncorpus on claims adjudicated on the merits in state court unless the state court’s\nadjudication of the claim “was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of,\nclearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United\nStates.” 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d). In order to prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel\nclaim, a petitioner must show that counsel’s performance was deficient and that he was\nprejudiced by counsel’s deficient performance. Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668,\n687 (1984).\n\n       The parties do not dispute whether counsel’s performance was deficient;\nRespondent argues only that Glover has not shown prejudice. The Supreme Court has\nheld that “when counsel’s constitutionally deficient performance deprives a defendant\nof an appeal that he otherwise would have taken, the defendant has made out a\nsuccessful ineffective assistance of counsel claim entitling him to an appeal.” Roe v.\nFlores-Ortega, 528 U.S. 470, 484 (2000). “[W]e . . . presum[e] prejudice with no further\n\fNo. 11-1614        Glover v. Birkett                                                Page 3\n\n\nshowing from the defendant of the merits of his underlying claims when the violation\nof the right to counsel rendered the proceeding . . . entirely nonexistent.” Id.\n\n       Respondent argues that Glover was not completely deprived of a direct appeal\nin this case because the Michigan Court of Appeals considered and denied his claims on\nthe merits in considering his application for leave to appeal. We previously considered,\nand rejected, this argument in Hardaway v. Robinson, 655 F.3d 445 (6th Cir. 2011).\nLike Glover in this case, Hardaway had filed in the state courts a delayed application for\nleave to appeal, followed by a motion for relief from judgment, followed by an\napplication for leave to appeal the denial of his motion for relief. We found that\nappellate review of the denial of collateral relief was not a sufficient substitute for a\ndirect appeal:\n\n       The disposition of an application for leave to appeal is within the\n       discretion of the Michigan Court of Appeals, and is a preliminary step to\n       having the case proceed as an appeal of right. See Mich. Ct. R.\n       7.205(D)(2), (3) . . . . Only if the leave application is granted will the\n       case proceed as an appeal of right. See Mich. Ct. R. 7.205(D)(3).\n       Furthermore, unlike the appellant in an appeal of right, the applicant\n       denied leave to appeal does not receive the benefit of oral argument. See\n       Mich. Ct. R. 7.205(D)(1). Nor does the defendant have a right to\n       appointed counsel on post-conviction review . . . . Taken together, these\n       differences render Michigan’s collateral post-conviction proceeding too\n       unlike an appeal of right to constitute a sufficient substitute.\n\nHardaway, 655 F.3d at 449-50 (emphasis added) (citation omitted). Thus, Hardaway\nwas “deprived . . . of the appellate proceeding altogether,” and prejudice was presumed.\nHardaway, 655 F.3d at 449 (citing Flores-Ortega, 528 U.S. at 483-84). This case is\nmaterially indistinguishable from Hardaway.\n\n       Respondent nonetheless attempts to avoid the application of Hardaway by\narguing that Hardaway is inconsistent with the Supreme Court’s decision in Harrington\nv. Richter, 131 S. Ct. 770 (2011). We have also previously considered this argument,\nand rejected it, in our decision involving Glover’s prior habeas petition challenging his\nconviction and sentence for the assault of his ex-wife, in which he raised an identical\n\fNo. 11-1614        Glover v. Birkett                                                Page 4\n\n\nclaim. Glover v. Palmer, No. 10-1577, 2012 WL 618209, at *2 (6th Cir. Feb. 28, 2012).\nAs we pointed out in that case,\n\n       Harrington addressed the question whether we should treat an\n       unexplained order as one on the merits. That question is different from\n       the antecedent question whether the proceeding giving rise to the order\n       is the functional equivalent of a direct appeal. And the answer to that\n       question, under Hardaway, is “no.”\n\nId.; see also Hardaway, 655 F.3d at 450. And, in any event, Hardaway was decided\nafter Harrington, and we are bound by its determination that post-Harrington, the denial\nof an application for leave to appeal is not a sufficient substitute for a counseled direct\nappeal. See 6 Cir. R. 206(c); Brown v. United States, 462 F.3d 609, 620 (6th Cir. 2006)\n(“This court has long adhered to the venerable principle that a prior published decision\nremains controlling unless overturned by an inconsistent decision of the United States\nSupreme Court or by this court itself sitting en banc.” (internal quotation marks\nomitted)).\n\n       Because counsel’s deficient performance deprived Glover of his appeal of right,\nprejudice is presumed. We thus affirm the district court order conditionally granting\nGlover’s petition for habeas relief.\n\f",

Taken together, these differences render Michigan's collateral post-conviction proceeding too unlike an appeal of right to constitute a sufficient substitute.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Hardaway,</i> 655 F.3d at 449-50 (emphasis added) (citation omitted). Thus, Hardaway was \"deprived . . . of the appellate proceeding altogether,\" and prejudice was presumed. <i>Hardaway,</i> 655 F.3d at 449 (citing <i>Flores-Ortega,</i> 528 U.S. at 483-84, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118339\"><a href=\"/opinion/118339/roe-v-flores-ortega/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1029</span></a></span>). This case is materially indistinguishable from <i>Hardaway.</i></p>\n<p>Respondent nonetheless attempts to avoid the application of <i>Hardaway</i> by arguing that <i>Hardaway</i> is inconsistent with the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Harrington v. Richter,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"182992\"><a href=\"/opinion/182992/harrington-v-richter/\"><span class=\"volume\">131</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">770</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"182992\"><a href=\"/opinion/182992/harrington-v-richter/\"><span class=\"volume\">178</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">624</span></a></span> (2011). We have also previously considered this argument, and rejected it, in our decision involving Glover's prior habeas petition challenging his conviction and sentence for the assault of his ex-wife, in which he raised an identical claim. <i>Glover v. Palmer,</i> No. 10-1577, 464 Fed.Appx. 454, 456, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2012</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">618209</span></span>, at *2 (6th Cir. Feb. 28, 2012). As we pointed out in that case,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<i>Harrington</i> addressed the question whether we should treat an unexplained order as one on the merits. That question is different from the antecedent question whether the proceeding giving rise to the order is the functional equivalent of a direct appeal. And the answer to that question, under <i>Hardaway,</i> is \"no.\"</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.; see also </i><i>Hardaway,</i> 655 F.3d at 450. And, in any event, <i>Hardaway</i> was decided after <i>Harrington,</i> and we are bound by its determination that post-<i>Harrington,</i> the denial of an application for leave to appeal is not a sufficient substitute for a counseled direct appeal. <i>See</i> 6 Cir. R. 206(c); <i>Brown v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"795630\"><a href=\"/opinion/795630/timothy-brown-individually-and-as-next-friend-of-melody-brown-his-minor/\"><span class=\"volume\">462</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">609</span></a></span>, 620 (6th Cir.2006) (\"This court has long adhered to the venerable principle that a prior published decision remains controlling unless overturned by an inconsistent decision of the United States Supreme Court or by this court itself sitting <i>en banc.\"</i> (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p>Because counsel's deficient performance deprived Glover of his appeal of right, prejudice is presumed. We thus affirm the district court order conditionally granting Glover's petition for habeas relief.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  The Honorable Kenneth F.
